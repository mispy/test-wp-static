<section><h2>Empirical View</h2><h3>Global decline of child mortality</h3><p>One reason why we do not see progress is that we are unaware of how bad the past was.</p><p>In 1800 the health conditions of our ancestors were such that 43% of the world&apos;s newborns died before their 5th birthday. These estimates are shown in the visualisation below.</p><p>In 1960 child mortality was still 18.5%. Almost every 5th child born in that year died in childhood.</p><p>Over the last decades we have seen a very rapid decline of child mortality globally. In 2015 child mortality was down to 4.3% &#x2013; 10-fold lower than 2 centuries ago. You have to take this long perspective to see the progress that we have achieved.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/global-child-mortality-timeseries" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-child-mortality-timeseries_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/global-child-mortality-timeseries"></div></a></div></p><h3>Country by country decline in child mortality</h3><p>In the time series plot below I show child mortality over the long run. Today child mortality in industrialized countries is below 0.5%. The time series plot shows that these low mortality rates are a very recent development, and in pre-modern countries child mortality rates were between 30% and 50%. In the late 19th century, every second child&#xA0;in Germany died before its fifth birthday. In developing countries the health of children is quickly improving &#x2013; but child mortality is still much higher than in developed countries.</p><p>A second interesting characteristic that is immediately noticeable is that the series are very &apos;spikey&apos; in the 19th century and are then much smoother in the 20th century. This is partly because the data quality is improving over time but it also shows how frequent crises were in pre-modern times. The decline of crises is an important aspect of improving &apos;living standards&apos;. In our <a href="//ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/volatility-of-food-prices/#year-to-year-variation-in-the-price-of-wheat-in-pisa-1351-1799-o-gradaref">entry on food price volatility</a> you find a long-run series in Pisa that shows how frequent food crises were. In the following plot you can see what these and other crises &#x2013; epidemics or wars, for example &#x2013; meant for the health of the population.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/child-mortality" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/child-mortality_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/child-mortality"></div></a></div></p><h3>Global picture of child mortality from 1800 until today</h3><p>The chart shows the child mortality rate &#x2013; the share of children dying before they reach the age of 5 &#x2013; for the entire world population at 4 different points in time.</p><p><em><strong>How to read the following graph:</strong> On the x-axis you find the cumulative share of the world population. The countries are ordered along the x-axis descending by the country&#x2019;s child mortality rate. This makes it possible to see the child mortality rate for each country. Some countries are labelled, but not all. It is also possible to see which share of the world population had a child mortality rate lower than a given level. For the orange line &#x2013; referring to&#xA0;data from 1950-60 &#x2013; we see that close to 70% of the world population have a child mortality rate of higher than 10% back then.<br>
</em></p><p>For 1800 (red line), you see that the countries on the very left &#x2013; Yemen, India, and others that are not labelled &#x2013;&#xA0;had a child mortality rate higher than 50%. Every second child died before the age of 5. On the very right of the red line you see that in 1800 the best-off countries in the world had a child mortality rate higher than 30%: Every third child died in the countries with the <em>best</em> health.</p><p>Looking at the orange line, you see that in the following 150 years some countries substantially reduced their child mortality rate: 30% of the world population has a child mortality under 10%. Other countries were stuck in poor health: More than half of the world (57%) had child mortality that were still higher than 20%. The world was clearly divided into developed and developing countries. The rapid progress of the industrialized countries had the consequence that the distribution of global health was hugely unequal.</p><p>The latest data refers to 2013. Global health has improved hugely. Particularly those countries that had the worst health in the 1950s experienced the most dramatic improvements. China for example reduced its child mortality from 28.4% to now 1.3%. The consequence of the faster progress in former developing countries is that global health inequality has fallen since the 1950s.</p><p>The global average child mortality rate (weighted population) was 43.3% in 1800 and now fell to 3.4%. Focusing at global inequality we see that in 1800 health was bad around the world, in the 1950s the world became unequal, and today we are back to higher equality but on a much higher level.</p><p>Comparing the position of countries on the red, orange, green and blue lines also makes it possible to see the change in a single countries: In 1800 every second child in South Korea died, in the 1950s the rate was halved (26%), and today it is down to 2.7%.</p><h6>World population by level of child mortality&#xA0;over time, 1800-2013<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a><p></p>

The absolute number of child deaths also depends on the absolute number of births and is shown in the following chart.</p><p>In the late 1960s there close to 20 million children died every year. Even though the number of births increased since then, the absolute number of child deaths started to decrease and from annually more than 20 million deaths declined to below 6 million deaths. The annual decrease of this reduction stayed remarkably stable over these five decades. In the period from 1990 to 2015 the world saw on average 272,169 fewer children die every year, while the number of births globally <a href="/grapher/annual-number-of-births-by-world-region">increased slightly</a>.

(2015)<a id="ref-6" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-6"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">6</sup></a> presented estimates on the causes of deaths of children in 2000 and 2013. The tree map below presents this data. Each rectangle corresponds to a cause of child mortality. The size of each rectangle shows the share of children killed by each cause. The three leading causes are preterm birth complications (15% of total; 0.965 million), pneumonia (2% in the first month, 13% later; 0.935 million in total), and intrapartum-related complications (11%, 0&#xB7;662 million).</p><p>44% of all children died in the first month of their life. More than half of all children (51.8%) died of infectious diseases. The researchers report &quot;deaths due to infectious diseases, such as<br>
pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria, are concentrated in the first 2 years of life, which should direct programmes towards these very young ill children&quot;.</p><p>The color of each rectangle indicates the annual reduction of the mortality rate from that specific cause since 2000. Child mortality from all causes declined; the smallest decline (0.2%) was achieved for pertussis, also known as whooping cough; the largest decline was achieved for measles (12.8%) for which <a href="/data/health/vaccination/">a vaccination is widely available</a>. As the causes of mortality later in childhood are declining faster the researchers observe a shift in the timing of child deaths closer and closer to the time of birth.</p><p>The absolute number of children dying decreased: In 2000 9,887 million children died before they were 5 years old &#x2013; 13 years later, 6,282 million children died. This happened while the absolute number of livebirths increased from 127,703 million in 2000 to 137,688 million in 2013.</p><p>Since cause of death data is not available for all countries in the world the researchers had to make use of three different sources of data: The preferred data was of course vital registration data; where not available Liu et al. (2015) estimated the cause of death with a multicause model, applying a multinomial logistic regression framework and when this was not possible they used a &quot;verbal autopsy databased multicause model&quot;.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7281" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7281" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-707x550.png" alt="U5_Deaths_by_Cause_2013_Lancet_data" width="707" height="650" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-150x117.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-400x311.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-707x550.png 707w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_u5_deaths_by_cause_2013_lancet_data-768x598.png 768w"></a></p><h4>All causes of child death &#x2013; globally over time</h4><p>The following visualisation is following on the change over time and shows the number of child deaths by cause.

Taking these two time series together makes it possible to estimate how many children a woman on average lost before the children were five years old.<br>
Below you see the data for Sweden which is one of the country for which we have the best historical data, the Swedish office for population statistics <em>Tabellverket</em> was founded as early as 1749.<a id="ref-8" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-8"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">8</sup></a> The visualization shows that throughout most of the 19th century Swedish women gave birth to more than 4 children. As we have seen above, child mortality in this period was often higher than 25%.

Today, those absolute mortality numbers are only 7.4 and 3.8 respectively, but there is still nearly a two-fold difference in mortality rate.

</h6><h3>Health care and child mortality</h3><p>In a publication in the American Economic Journal the authors report that Thailand&apos;s 2001 healthcare reform led to significant reductions in child mortality, especially among the poor.<a id="ref-15" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-15"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">15</sup></a> The following graph shows for a large cross-section of countries that high expenditure on health more generally comes along with lower levels of child mortality.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/per-capita-total-expenditure-on-health-vs-child-mortality" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/per-capita-total-expenditure-on-health-vs-child-mortality_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/per-capita-total-expenditure-on-health-vs-child-mortality"></div></a></div></p><h3>When more infants survive &#x2013; fertility goes down</h3><p>On the y-axis we measure the number of annual live births per 1,000 people. On the x-axis we measure how many infants, who were born alive, survive their 1st year of life &#x2013; this is the <em>infant survival rate.</em></p><p>The chart shows how these two aspects changed over the course of the 20th century: At the beginning of the century all 4 countries can be found in the upper left corner &#x2013; they are characterized by high fertility and an infant survival rate below 85%. If we follow the 4 lines we are taken to the bottom right corner and see that women have fewer children when the mortality rate of babies goes down.</p><p>The causal link between infant survival and fertility is established in both directions: Firstly, increasing infant survival reduces the parents&#x2019; demand for children. And secondly, a decreasing fertility allows the parents to devote more attention and resources to their children.</p><p>This link between fertility and child mortality is an immensely important insight and tells us what drives the acceleration and slowdown of population growth: In the initial stage of the transition, when fertility rates are still high but health is already improving, the population starts to grow. But then, a bit later, we see that this transition works to decrease population growth since improving health of the children leads to lower fertility. It is an important part of the mechanism behind the <a href="/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/#the-demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>.</p><p>A very cynical view is that a decrease in child mortality is bad for the world since it would contribute to the overpopulation of the planet. The chart above shows that this opinion is not just&#xA0;contemptuous of human life but plainly wrong: When more infants survive fertility goes down and the temporary population growth comes to an end. If we want to ensure that the world&#x2019;s population increase comes to an end soon we must work to increase child survival.</p><h6>Infant survival and fertility through time &#x2013; Max Roser<a id="ref-16" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-16"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">16</sup></a><p></p>

<section><h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><h3>Definitions</h3><p>Child mortality is the probability per 1,000 live births that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five under current age-specific mortality patterns.</p><p>Infant mortality is defined as the number of deaths of children under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births.<br>
A neonatal death is defined as a death during the first 28 days of life (0-27 days).</p><p>The neonatal mortality rate is defined as the number of neonatal deaths per 1000 live births.</p><h3>Data Quality</h3><p>The uncertainty associated with the estimates of child mortality can be understood if one compares different data sources. The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation does this for each country of the world. <a href="http://www.childmortality.org/index.php?r=site/graph#ID=BRA_Brazil">Here</a> is the chart on the child mortality of Brazil as one example. On the same website the differences between various data sources can be studied for a large number of countries.</p><h4>Wide within-country variation of infant mortality</h4><p>Country averages of infant mortality&#xA0;sometimes obscure the variation in infant mortality between regions within the country.&#xA0;Storeygard, Balk, Levy and Deane (2008) assembled a data-set that looks at the sub-national distribution of infant mortality.<a id="ref-17" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-17"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">17</sup></a>&#xA0;The data set covers over 10,000 national and subnational units worldwide.

Understandably, many of the countries with the highest national infant mortality averages have lots of subnational variation in these rates, but even some of the most highly developed nations still see massive variation in infant mortality at the regional level. The most extreme example is China, which experiences an infant mortality rate near 0 in some regions but a rate around 325 at the other extreme.</p><h6>The wide variation of infant mortality within countries<a id="ref-18" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-18"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">18</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6109 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-750x544.png" alt="The wide variation of infant mortality within countries" width="750" height="544" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-150x109.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-400x290.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.28.10-750x544.png 750w"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The following map visualizes the subnational variation in infant mortality rates from the previous chart.</p><h6>World map of infant mortality on the sub-national level<a id="ref-19" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-19"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">19</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6108 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-750x401.png" alt="World map of infant mortality on the sub-national level" width="750" height="401" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-150x80.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-400x214.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2015-08-01-at-13.27.45-750x401.png 750w"></a></p></section>
