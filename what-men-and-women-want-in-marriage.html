One reason for that is that it is more straightforward to measure health-related aspects (like <a href="/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> or <a href="/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a>) or income measures (like <a href="/gdp-data/">GDP</a>, <a href="/income-inequality/">income inequality</a> or <a href="/world-poverty/">poverty</a>).</p><p>A rare opportunity to see how values have changed in the US was discovered by Boxer et al (reference below) who compared surveys in which people were asked what they seek in a spouse. I took the first and last survey results reported by the authors and visualized it in the chart below: It allows us to compare the relative importance of these traits in 1939 and seven decades later. The big winner is &apos;mutual attraction &#x2013; love&apos; which now ranks as the most important aspect for both women and men. But also &apos;Education, intelligence&apos; and &apos;Sociability&apos; rose in importance. The relative losers are &apos;Good Health&apos; and at the very bottom &apos;Chastity&apos;.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Men-and-Women-want-in-marriage.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7705" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/What-Men-and-Women-want-in-marriage-750x525.png" alt="What-Men-and-Women-want-in-marriage" width="750" height="525"></a></p><p>The data are from Christie F.
