(Iran made this transition under a conservative Muslim government.)</p><p>We also see from the chart that the speed with which countries can achieve low fertility has increased over time. A century ago it took the United Kingdom 95 years and the US 82 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 to less than 3. This is a pattern that we see often in development: those countries that first experience social change take much longer for transitions than those who catch up later: Countries that were catching up increased <a href="/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> much faster, they reduced <a href="/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> more quickly and were able to grow their <a href="/gdp-data/">incomes</a> much more rapidly.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7753" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-750x525.png" alt="Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3" width="750" height="525" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3-768x538.png 768w"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p></section>
