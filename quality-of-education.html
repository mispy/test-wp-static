While increasing the access to education is important, the actual goal of providing schooling is to teach skills and transfer knowledge to students in the classroom. This entry focusses on the outcomes of schooling &#x2013; the quality of education.</p><p>While we have good empirical data on the access to education we know much less about the quality of education. Unfortunately, the data on the skills and knowledge of students is sparse and has limited spatial and temporal coverage. This is in part due to the difficulty and cost of creating and implementing standardized assessments that can be compared across borders and time.</p><p>Efforts to measure these outcomes are geographically more restricted (often only OECD countries are included) and even less is known about how the performance of students with respect to these outcomes has changed over time. A third limitation is that measures are sometimes not comparable between countries.</p><p>Most often these assessment are measuring learning outcomes of one or several of the following three dimensions:</p><ul>
<li>Reading and language proficiency</li>
<li>Mathematics and numeracy proficiency</li>
<li>Scientific knowledge and understanding</li>
</ul><p>The assessments differ in respect to how children are selected. While some assessments select children by their age, there are other assessments which select children by the school grade the child attends. The aim of these studies is to test&#xA0;a representative random sample of the intended population.</p><p>The most widely available metric on the outcomes of education is literacy. Data and research on literacy is discussed in detail in <a href="/literacy/">our entry on the topic</a>.</p></section>






<section><h2>Empirical View</h2><p><!------------------></p><h3>The PISA study</h3><p>The <em>Program for International Student Assessment</em> (PISA) assessment, which is coordinated by the OECD, is the most well known international assessment of learning outcomes. The first PISA study was carried out in 1997 and since then it was repeated every three years.</p><p>The study is not select students by grade, but by age and only tests 15-year-olds, whatever their school level. In a two-hour assessment the competencies in reading, mathematics and science of these students are assessed. It is a very substantial undertaking and until 2017 &quot;half a million students representing 28 million 15-year-olds in 72 countries and economies have participated in PISA&quot; <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/">according to the OECD</a>. The coverage of PISA can be seen in <a href="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-reading-scale">this map</a> on the results in the reading dimension, it obviously includes the richer OECD countries and unfortunately only few poorer countries. Poorer countries are also not tested regularly and were only participating in one round only and additionally it can be the case that for poorer countries not students from the entire country were selected, but instead only from particular regions.</p><p>PISA, as well as TIMSS, are standardizing their results so that the average score of students from OECD countries is 500 and the student standard deviation is 100. Assuming a normal distribution of measurement outcomes this means 68% of OECD students are reaching scores in the range between 400 and 600.</p><p>While TIMSS focuses on content that is covered in the school curriculum PISA aims to &quot;assesses the application of skills to real-life problems&quot; and&#xA0;&quot;emphasizes the importance of the context in which students should be able to use their skills (schools, home and society)&quot;.</p><p>PISA tests the students in three different dimensions, which they define as follows:<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a></p><ul>
<li><em>&quot;<strong>Science literacy</strong> is defined as the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen. A scientifically literate person is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science and technology, which requires the competencies to explain phenomena scientifically, evaluate and design scientific enquiry, and interpret data and evidence scientifically.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Reading literacy</strong> is defined as students&#x2019; ability to understand, use, reflect on and engage with written texts in order to achieve one&#x2019;s goals, develop one&#x2019;s knowledge and potential, and participate in society.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mathematical literacy</strong> is defined as students&#x2019; capacity to formulate, employ and interpret mathematics in a variety of contexts. It includes reasoning mathematically and using mathematical concepts, procedures, facts and tools to describe, explain and predict phenomena. It assists individuals in recognising the role that mathematics plays in the world and to make the well-founded judgements and decisions needed by constructive, engaged and reflective citizens.&quot;</em></li>
</ul><p><strong>Cross country comparability of the PISA results</strong></p><p>When the PISA study includes non-OECD countries it is often the case that students are not selected from the entire country, but instead only from selected regions within that country.&#xA0;Results reported for China &#x2013; <a href="http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/embed/map?lg=en">and labelled as such by the OECD</a> &#x2013; in fact are only based on four Chinese provinces: Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong. These regions are not representative of China as a whole and there is every reason to expect that students from these provinces have access to better education than the average Chinese 15-year-olds. The four regions are among the very richest regions of China and incomes are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_GDP_per_capita">up to twice that of the national Chines average</a>.</p><p>Similarly when PISA reported on &quot;India&quot; in 2009 the assessments were made in two states of India only (Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).</p><h4>Results from the PISA study</h4><p>The three maps below show the results for the three subjects in which students are assessed.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-reading-scale?tab=map" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-reading-scale-a42c8357c168ebd03c90930b9d3c439b_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-reading-scale?tab=map"></div></a></div></p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-mathematics-scale?tab=map" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-mathematics-scale-a42c8357c168ebd03c90930b9d3c439b_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-mathematics-scale?tab=map"></div></a></div></p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-science-scale?tab=map" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-science-scale-a42c8357c168ebd03c90930b9d3c439b_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-science-scale?tab=map"></div></a></div></p><p><!------------------></p><h3>PIRLS and TIMSS &#x2013; The assessments by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement</h3><p><!------------------></p><h4>TIMSS &#x2013;&#xA0;Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study</h4><p>As the name says, TIMSS is an assessment of the&#xA0;mathematics and science knowledge of students.

<section><h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2><h3>The importance of culture</h3><p>Another interesting aspect of school performance is the effect of family environments and culture on students exam performance. A study by John Jerrim finds that children of East Asian immigrants to Australia outperform their native counterparts in the PISA tests.<a id="ref-7" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-7"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">7</sup></a> In mathematics, he finds them to be ahead by 100 points representing two and a half years of education. This evidence suggests that the differences highlighted by PISA and the IEA may be driven by cultural or family factors rather than the schooling systems.</p><h3>Correlation with Overall Development</h3><p>Indicators of skills and knowledge, such as the OECD PISA scores, are highly correlated with indicators of economic development. The following scatter plot shows the correlation between the PISA reading scores and the United Nations&apos; Human Development Index (HDI) for a select group of countries.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/correlation-between-oecd-pisa-reading-test-score-and-un-human-development-index-2012" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/correlation-between-oecd-pisa-reading-test-score-and-un-human-development-index-2012_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/correlation-between-oecd-pisa-reading-test-score-and-un-human-development-index-2012"></div></a></div></p><h3>Competition and School Quality</h3><p>There exists a substantial literature on the effects of competition on school quality and performance. Whether choice improves school quality remains an open question in economics. In general we might expect that more schools might be better for outcomes through competitive forces, however this relies on both schools and parents responding to the increased competition/choice. On the demand side, parents need some way of observing school quality accurately as well as the ability to change schools. Meanwhile, schools need some incentive to respond to any increase in competition. This is especially important since most public school systems lack any profit motive.</p><p>Much of the research into the effects of competition rely on indirect measures of demand for high quality schools such as local rents and house prices. Disaggregating the willingness to pay for better schools from neighbourhood effects and sociodemographic factors is highly technical and relies on models of sorting. For more information on these models see Rothstein (American Economic Review, 2006), Bayer and McMillan (NBER, 2005), and Bayer et al. (NBER, 2007).<a id="ref-8" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-8"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">8</sup></a></p><p>An alternative approach has been to use variables correlated with school competition but independent of the other the demand and supply factors to disaggregate the different effects of choice (instrumental variables approach). For more information on this approach please see Hoxby (American Economic Review, 2000) and Rothstein (American Economic Review, 2007).<a id="ref-9" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-9"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">9</sup></a></p><h3>The Effect of Resources and Development</h3><p>Recent research however suggests that the link between resources and school quality is not simple. The OECD looked into whether money can buy stronger PISA test performance. They concluded that the most important factor in PISA test performance is how resources are used: countries that prioritized the quality of teachers over class sizes performed much better. This view represents a growing consensus in the education literature that inputs such as class size and expenditure per pupil have little to no effect on the returns to schooling in the developed world.<a id="ref-10" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-10"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">10</sup></a></p><p>An argument made by Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann is that the lack of any straightforward relationship between resources and school outcomes indicates a minimum resource requirement.<a id="ref-11" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-11"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">11</sup></a> Once the resource threshold has been reached, additional expenditure has little or no returns to school quality -- instead, teacher quality and other constraints matter far more.</p><p>The following scatter shows average spending per student from the age of 6 to 15 against reading test scores in 2009.</p><h6>Average reading performance in PISA and average spending per student from the age of 6 to 15 - OECD<a id="ref-12" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-12"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">12</sup></a><p></p>
