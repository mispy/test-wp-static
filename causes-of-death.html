<h3 id="comparisons-of-causes-of-death"><a class="deep-link" href="#comparisons-of-causes-of-death"></a>I.1 Comparisons of causes of death</h3>
<p>In the chart below we provide a comparison of the number of people which died as a result of specific causes in 2016. This data is given as the total across all ages, and both sexes. Causes of death varies notably between age groups&#xA0;&#x2014; deaths across individual age groupings can be explored in the sections which follow.</p>
<p>At a global level we see that the majority of deaths are attributed to the category of <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-communicable diseases</a> (NCDs); these are chronic, long-term illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases (including stroke), respiratory disease, cancers and diabetes.&#xA0; Collectively NCDs account for more than 70 percent of global deaths. The remaining 25-30 percent of deaths are those attributed to categories including malnutrition, infectious diseases, preventable disease, accidents and self-harm or interpersonal deaths (including homicide, conflict and terrorist-related deaths).</p>
<p>Causes of death vary significantly by country and income levels across the world.&#xA0;We look at the major differences in mortality across the world using country examples in our blog post <a href="/what-does-the-world-die-from/">here</a>. NCDs not only dominate mortality figures at a global level, but also account for the majority of deaths in high-income countries. Deaths from causes such as infectious disease, malnutrition, nutritional deficiencies, neonatal and maternal deaths in high-income countries is typically very low in relative terms.</p>
<p>These causes of death are, however, still prevalent (and some cases dominant) across low-to-middle income nations. In Kenya, for example, the leading cause of death remains diarrheal diseases. In South Africa and Botswana, the leading cause of death remains HIV/AIDS. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, protein-energy malnutrition is the highest killer.</p>
<p>Death rates related to disease, illness and other health factors tend to change relatively slowly over time. Whilst death rates may fall or decline from year-to-year as part of a general trend, dramatic changes in such deaths are typically rare. Natural disaster and terrorism-related deaths are an important exception to this rule: mortality from disasters or terrorism/conflict events can be volatile. Knowing the death rate from the previous year does not necessarily allow for an easy interpolation to the next year. This can make the annual comparison of deaths and death rates between health-related factors and volatile events more challenging. Understanding the relative risk of these events can require a longer-term overview of high and low-mortality years. We cover discussion and analysis on this topic in a blog post <strong>[here]</strong>.</p>
<p>Whilst terrorism-related deaths are typically very low for most countries relative to other mortality causes, in some cases they can be significant. For example, terrorism fatalities were the 7th largest killer in Iraq in 2016. This is well above deaths related to road accidents, respiratory disease and dementia. <div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause"></div></a></div></p>
<h3 id="causes-of-death-by-age-group"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-by-age-group"></a>I.2 Causes of death by age group</h3>
<p>In the chart below we see the total annual number of deaths differentiated by broad age category. In 2016, we see there were around 55 million deaths globally; nearly half of these (48%) were in those aged 70 years or older; 27% in the 50-69 year age group; 15% aged 15-49; only 1% aged 5-14; and around 10% in children under the age of 5.</p>
<p>The demographics of deaths has changed significantly since 1990 with a notable shift from young-to-old. In 1990 nearly one-quarter of all deaths were in children under 5 years old. In 2016, this had declined to just under 10 percent. In contrast, the share of deaths in the over-70s age bracket has increased from 33 percent to 48 percent over this period.</p>
<p>The distribution of deaths by age varies significantly by country. In Japan, for example, around 83 percent of deaths occur in those aged 70 or older. Deaths in children and adolescents less than 15 years old account for around 0.25 percent of the total. Contrast this with South Sudan where the majority of deaths (44 percent) occur in children under 5 years old. In South Africa, where the leading cause of death is HIV/AIDS, the leading age bracket is aged 15-49.&#xA0; <div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-age-group" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/number-of-deaths-by-age-group_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-age-group"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="causes-of-death-in-under-5s"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-in-under-5s"></a>Causes of death in under-5s</h4>
<p>The chart below shows the number of deaths in children under 5 years old by cause. Through the combination of neonatal (newborn infants less than 28 days old) disorders, infections and congenital (from birth) defects, we see that the largest share of deaths in under-5s arises from complications at birth or in the first few weeks of life. Under-5s are also highly susceptible to lower respiratory infections, infectious diseases, diarrheal infections, malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p>Death rates in under-5s are typically much lower in high-income countries, and the nature of these deaths is different from lower incomes. In the United Kingdom, for example, child deaths tend to be highly dominated by neonatal complications; deaths from infectious and diarrheal diseases and malnutrition is very low. In contrast, the leading cause of death in under-5s in Mali is malaria. In South Sudan, malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies are very high.&#xA0;<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-in-under-5s" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/annual-number-of-deaths-in-under-5s_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-in-under-5s"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="causes-of-death-aged-5-14"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-aged-5-14"></a>Causes of death aged 5-14</h4>
<p>Globally, deaths in the 5-14 year old age bracket account for a small percentage of the total (1-2 percent). There are six dominant causes of deaths in this age category. The leading cause globally in 5-14 year olds is malaria (although its dominance, of course, varies regionally with malaria distribution). Lower respiratory infections, road accidents, HIV/AIDS, cancers, diarrheal diseases, and drowning are all dominant causes typically in the range of 50,000-60,000 deaths in 2016.</p>
<p>Again, this distribution varies by country. In the United States, for example, cancers are the leading cause of death. In India, it&apos;s diarrheal diseases; in Bangladesh and China it&apos;s drowning; and in South Africa road accidents. <div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-5-14-year-olds" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/causes-of-death-in-5-14-year-olds_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-5-14-year-olds"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="causes-of-death-aged-15-49"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-aged-15-49"></a>Causes of death aged 15-49</h4>
<p>By the 15-49 years old category, we see that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) begin to become dominant. Globally the leading cause of death in this age group is cardiovascular disease, followed cancers which both account for more than one million deaths. Road accidents, HIV/AIDS and suicide are all significant within this group.</p>
<p>For some countries, such as South Africa, by far the dominant cause of death (across all age groups) is HIV/AIDS in the 15-49 years old age bracket. In a number of countries (in particular across Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico), homicide is the dominant cause for 15-49 years old.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-15-49-year-olds" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/causes-of-death-in-15-49-year-olds_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-15-49-year-olds"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="causes-of-death-aged-50-69"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-aged-50-69"></a>Causes of death aged 50-69</h4>
<p>By aged 50-69 years old, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are strongly dominant &#x2014; here cardiovascular disease, cancers, respiratory disease and diabetes are the top causes. With the exception of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis which for some countries climb into the top causes, the global variability in death causes for 50-69 year olds is much lower than that of younger age categories.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-50-69-year-olds" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/causes-of-death-in-50-69-year-olds_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-50-69-year-olds"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="causes-of-death-aged-70"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-aged-70"></a>Causes of death aged 70+</h4>
<p>For the oldest age category (70 years and older), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) still dominate, however other death causes including Alzheimer&apos;s/dementias, and diarrheal diseases also become dominant. Diarrheal diseases remain within the few leading causes of deaths in 70+ year olds for many low-income countries, despite being relatively low at higher incomes.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-70-year-olds" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/causes-of-death-in-70-year-olds_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/causes-of-death-in-70-year-olds"></div></a></div></p>
<h3 id="comparisons-of-risk-factors-of-death"><a class="deep-link" href="#comparisons-of-risk-factors-of-death"></a>I.3 Comparisons of risk factors of death</h3>
<p>Whilst the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessment assigns each death to one specific cause, we know that the risk of disease burden and health outcomes are closely linked to a number of risk factors. It includes risk factors across four broad categories:&#xA0;behavioural, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks.</p>
<p>We describe further information on how the GBD attributes risk factors to mortality in our <a href="/causes-of-death#estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> section. Note that this process of estimation is not additive; in other words, these risk-specific relationships do not account for the compounding effects of multiple risk factors. High BMI, for example, may likely be present with other lifestyle factors such as low physical activity levels, high blood pressure, low fruit and vegetable intake. All of these estimates are developed independently. We cannot therefore sum all &apos;attributed deaths&apos; and conclude that this is the actual number of deaths. The attributed number of deaths by risk factor in many cases exceeds that of those by cause of death.</p>
<p>In the chart below we see the number of deaths attributed to specific risk factors in 2016. This data is measured across all age groups and both sexes &#x2014; figures for specific age groups are detailed below. Here we see that there are several dominant risk factors for death: notably, those related to dietary and activity lifestyle factors (including blood pressure, physical activity, body-mass index, blood sugar, and dietary intake); smoking; air pollution (both outdoor and indoor); environmental factors including clean water and sanitation; and safe sex (for the prevention of HIV/AIDS).</p>
<p>The contribution of specific risk factors varies significantly by country. For most high-income countries, the dominant risk factors are those related to healthy diets, smoking and alcohol intake. Other risk factors such as clean water, sanitation, and child wasting or stunting are very low. In low-income countries the inverse is true: in Sierra Leone for example, the top risk factors include child wasting, household air pollution, unsafe water source, poor sanitation, and no access to handwashing facilities. For countries where HIV/AIDS is a major health burden, such as South Africa and Kenya, unsafe sex is the top risk factor. <div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor"></div></a></div></p>
<h3 id="risk-factors-of-death-by-age-group"><a class="deep-link" href="#risk-factors-of-death-by-age-group"></a>I.4 Risk factors of death by age group</h3>
<p>In the charts below we see how these risk factors differ between age groups, ranging from children under-5, to those 70+ years old. In the youngest age group we see dominant risk factors related to childhood development, including child wasting, stunting and low-birth weight. In older children and adolescents, environmental factors including water sources, sanitation, handwashing and air pollution become more dominant. By the 15-49 year old category, unsafe sex becomes the largest risk factor (in relation to the contraction of HIV/AIDS), with alcohol, smoking and some dietary factors also becoming important.</p>
<p>By the 50-69 year old and 70+ year old age category, lifestyle factors such as dietary intake, smoking, alcohol, and low physical intake become dominant&#xA0;&#x2014; ultimately increasing the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, stroke, respiratory disease and diabetes.</p>

<h3 id="cancers"><a class="deep-link" href="#cancers"></a>I.5 Cancers</h3>
<p>Cancers are defined by the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Cancer Institute (NCI)</a> as a collection of diseases in which abnormal cells can divide and spread to nearby tissue. As this definition suggests, cancers can arise in many parts of the body (leading to a range of cancer types, as shown below) and in some cases spread to other parts of the body through blood and lymph systems.</p>
<h4 id="cancer-deaths-by-type"><a class="deep-link" href="#cancer-deaths-by-type"></a>Cancer deaths by type</h4>
<p>In the chart below we see annual deaths attributed to cancers, differentiated by type. Globally, around 8.9 million deaths were attributed to cancers in 2016 &#x2014; an increase from around 5.7 million in 1990. You can also view cancer deaths in specific countries using the &quot;change country&quot; function.</p>
<p>As shown, there are a broad range of cancer types with varying magnitudes of total death. At a global level, tracheal and lung cancer is the largest killer with over 1.7 million in 2016, followed by stomach, colon and rectum, and liver cancer. On relative terms, testicular, thyroid and non-melenoma skin have the lowest death toll of cancers at the global level.&#xA0;<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cancer-deaths-by-type" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cancer-deaths-by-type_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cancer-deaths-by-type"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="cancer-deaths-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#cancer-deaths-by-age"></a>Cancer deaths by age</h4>
<p>In the chart below we see total cancer deaths broken down by age grouping. As we see, the majority of deaths arise in those over 50 years old, with 44 percent over 70 years old and 43 percent between 50-69 years old. Cancer deaths in children are much smaller in comparison (less than one percent of the total are in children under 14 years old) and typically arise as leukemia cases. <div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cancer-deaths-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cancer-deaths-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cancer-deaths-by-age"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="cancer-death-rates"><a class="deep-link" href="#cancer-death-rates"></a>Cancer death rates</h4>
<p>In the chart below we see cancer death rates, expressed as the number of cancer deaths per year per 100,000 individuals. Note that these rates have been age-standardized which aims to correct for differences in the age structure of a population (which are different between countries and change over time). This therefore allows us to compare the likelihood that any given individual will die from cancer across countries and through time.</p>
<p>Cancer death rates vary across the world, but for most death rates are below 150 per 100,000 individuals. Greenland had the highest cancer death rate in 2016, at 348 deaths per 100,000; Mongolia, Hungary and Zimbabwe also have notably higher cancer death rates relative to other countries.</p>
<p>If we use the timeline below to look at how cancer rates have changed with time we see that for many countries, this rate has declined since 1990. For example, rates in the United States have fallen from 180 to 145 per 100,000; in China from 206 to 157 per 100,000; in the United Kingdom from 198 to 159 per 100,000.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cancer-death-rates-per-100000_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000"></div></a></div></p>

<p>In the visualisation below we see these age-standardized death rates (measured per 100,000 people) for individual cancer types. Declines in cancer rates vary by type: for many, such as prostrate and kidney, progress has been relatively slow. For some, such as stomach cancer there has been notable progress&#xA0;&#x2014; declining from 23 to 13 deaths per 100,000.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-type" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cancer-death-rates-by-type_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-type"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="cancer-death-rates-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#cancer-death-rates-by-age"></a>Cancer death rates by age</h4>
<p>In the visualisation below we see how cancer death rates vary by age group. As we see, death rates are highest for those aged over 70 years old with nearly 1,000 deaths per 100,000 people. Rates in the 50-69 years old category are more than three times lower at just under 300 per 100,000 individuals. For children aged below 14 years old, rates at a global level are less than 5 per 100,000.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cancer-death-rates-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-age"></div></a></div></p>
<h3 id="cardiovascular-disease"><a class="deep-link" href="#cardiovascular-disease"></a>I.6 Cardiovascular disease</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a term used to refer to the <a href="http://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/about_cvd/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of diseases</a> which affect the heart and blood vessels. These include hypertension (high blood pressure); coronary heart disease (heart attack); cerebrovascular disease (stroke); heart failure; and other heart diseases. Cardiovascular disease data includes figures related to strokes, however we also cover this separately in the section <a href="/causes-of-death#stroke">below</a>. Cardiovascular disease is the top cause of death globally.</p>
<h4 id="cardiovascular-disease-deaths-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#cardiovascular-disease-deaths-by-age"></a>Cardiovascular disease deaths by age</h4>
<p>In the visualisation&#xA0; below we see the breakdown of deaths from CVD by age category. Globally we see that approximately 17.7 million people died from CVD. The majority (63 percent) of deaths occurred in the age bracket of 70 years and above. Just below 30 percent&#xA0; were aged 50-69, and the remaining 7-8 percent aged 15-49 (CVD deaths in those aged 14 years and under are small).&#xA0;<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-deaths-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cardiovascular-disease-deaths-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-deaths-by-age"></div></a></div></p>

This therefore allows us to compare the likelihood that any given individual will die from cardiovascular disease across countries and through time.</p>
<p>Overall we see a strong East-West divide in CVD death rates. Rates across North America and Western/Northern Europe tend to be significantly lower than those across Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Across most of Latin America, these rates are moderate. In France, for example, the age-standardized rate was around 110 per 100,000 in 2016; across Eastern Europe this rate was around 5 times higher at 500-600 per 100,000. At the highest end of the scale, Afghanistan had a rate of 830 per 100,000.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates"></div></a></div></p>

<p>In the chart below we see the CVD death rate per 100,000 differentiated by age categories. As established in the breakdown of CVD deaths by age, the majority of deaths occur in the 70+ years old age category. Death rates are therefore significantly higher in the oldest age group at 2750 per 100,000 in 2016.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/cardiovascular-disease-death-rates-by-age"></div></a></div></p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/cerebrovascular_accident/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defines a stroke</a> as the &quot;interruption of the blood supply to the brain, usually because a blood vessel bursts or is blocked by a clot. This cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients, causing damage to the brain tissue.&quot; Strokes are included as a sub-category within cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<h4 id="stroke-deaths-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#stroke-deaths-by-age"></a>Stroke deaths by age</h4>
<p>In the chart below we see the breakdown of total deaths attributed to strokes by age group. Globally it&apos;s estimated that 5.5 million people died from a stroke in 2016. The majority (61 percent) of deaths from stroke arise in those aged 70 years or older. Those aged 50-69 years old account for approximately one-third of deaths, with those aged 49 and under collectively account for around 7 percent.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/stroke-deaths-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/stroke-deaths-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/stroke-deaths-by-age"></div></a></div></p>

This therefore allows us to compare the likelihood that any given individual will die from stroke across countries and through time.</p>
<p>Stroke death rates vary significantly across the world. Death rates are lowest in Italy, Austria Qatar, Peru and Costa Rica where less than 25 per 100,000 die from stroke. At the other end of the spectrum, with rates ten times higher than the lowest countries are Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Mongolia, North Korea and Papua New Guinea (with rates between 200-250 per 100,000).<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/stroke-death-rates" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/stroke-death-rates_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/stroke-death-rates"></div></a></div></p>

<h3 id="respiratory-disease"><a class="deep-link" href="#respiratory-disease"></a>I.8 Respiratory disease</h3>
<p>Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are <a href="http://www.who.int/respiratory/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diseases which affect</a> the airways and overall structure of the lungs. Common CRDs include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
<h4 id="respiratory-disease-deaths-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#respiratory-disease-deaths-by-age"></a>Respiratory disease deaths by age</h4>
<p>The chart below shows the breakdown of deaths related to chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) by age group. Globally in 2016, around 3.5 million died from CRDs. Around two-thirds (66 percent) of respiratory disease deaths were from those aged 70 years and older, with a further 20 percent in the 50-69 year group; and the remaining 4-5 percent aged 14 years and younger. <div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/respiratory-disease-deaths-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/respiratory-disease-deaths-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/respiratory-disease-deaths-by-age"></div></a></div></p>

Note that these rates have been age-standardized which aims to correct for differences in the age structure of a population (which are different between countries and change over time). This therefore allows us to compare the likelihood that any given individual will die from CRDs across countries and through time.</p>
<p>In most countries across the world, the age-standardized death rate from CRDs are below 40 per 100,000 people. Rates across Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America are typically slightly higher (between 40 and 60 per 100,000), and are typically highest across South Asia (around 140 per 100,000 in India and Nepal). At a country-level the highest rate is in Papua New Guinea at 343 per 100,000.</p>
<p>Respiratory disease death rates have fallen dramatically in some countries over the past few decades. Since 1990, death rates in China have fallen around 70 percent from 247 to 75 per 100,000.

<p>Dementia comprises several forms&#xA0;&#x2014; the most common being Alzheimer&apos;s disease&#xA0;&#x2014; is <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs362/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an illness</a> which results in a deterioration of cognitive capacity and function beyond what is expect from the normal ageing process. It can occur either in a chronic or progressive form. It affects several cognitive functions including memory, comprehension, judgement, language and learning capacity.</p>
<h4 id="dementia-deaths-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#dementia-deaths-by-age"></a>Dementia deaths by age</h4>
<p>The chart below shows the breakdown of dementia-related deaths by age group. Dementia typically occurs in older persons: of the 2.4 million who died from dementia in 2016, 94 percent were 70 years or older.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/dementia-related-deaths-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/dementia-related-deaths-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/dementia-related-deaths-by-age"></div></a></div></p>
<h4 id="dementia-death-rates"><a class="deep-link" href="#dementia-death-rates"></a>Dementia death rates</h4>
<p>The visualisation below shows dementia&#xA0;death rates, expressed as the number of dementia deaths per year per 100,000 individuals. Note that these rates have been age-standardized which aims to correct for differences in the age structure of a population (which are different between countries and change over time). This therefore allows us to compare the likelihood that any given individual will die from dementia across countries and through time.</p>
<p>Across most countries, the death rate from dementia-related illness is below 55 per 100,000 individuals. Dementia rates in some countries have changed slightly since 1990, but significantly less so than other disease burdens.<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/dementia-death-rates" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/dementia-death-rates_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/dementia-death-rates"></div></a></div></p>
<h3 id="diarrheal-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#diarrheal-diseases"></a>I.10 Diarrheal diseases</h3>
<p>Diarrheal disease remains one of the largest causes of death in children, and in some countries (e.g. Kenya), it is the top mortality cause. Diarrheal diseases are typically <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a symptom of infections</a> within the intestinal tract and is contracted through poor hygiene, sanitation, unsafe water sources, or contaminated food. Most deaths result from dehydration and the loss of essential nutrients and salts. Diarrheal disease is both preventable and treatable.</p>
<h4 id="diarrheal-disease-deaths-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#diarrheal-disease-deaths-by-age"></a>Diarrheal disease deaths by age</h4>
<p>The chart below shows the breakdown of diarrheal disease deaths by age group. Overall we see there has been a significant reduction in global deaths since 1990: falling from 2.8 million to 1.6 million in 2016. Diarrheal deaths disproportionately affect the young and the old: 42 percent of global deaths were from those aged 70 years or older, with 27 percent under 5 years old.</p>
<p>Since 1990 there has been an even more dramatic reduction in deaths in children under 5 years old: in 1990 they accounted for 55 percent of deaths, which have fallen as a share by more than half to 27 percent. In absolute terms, this is a reduction from 1.5 million to under 500,000 (a reduction of more than two-thirds).&#xA0;<div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/deaths-from-diarrheal-diseases-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/deaths-from-diarrheal-diseases-by-age_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/deaths-from-diarrheal-diseases-by-age"></div></a></div></p>

<h2 id="data-definitions-quality"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-definitions-quality"></a>II. Data Definitions &amp; Quality</h2>
<h3 id="estimating-causes-of-death"><a class="deep-link" href="#estimating-causes-of-death"></a>II.1 Estimating causes of death</h3>
<p>The IHME&apos;s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) has developed a highly standardised approach to the attribution of deaths to specific causes based on data limitations, including&#xA0;incompleteness of vital registration (VR) data, the use of verbal autopsy (VA) studies in locations with incomplete VR records, the allocation of disease burden to categories which can be directly attributed to mortality causes, and general data insufficiency in some countries.<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a></p>
<p>The GBD assessment is strongly tied to mortality cause categories as defined within the <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Classification of Diseases (ICD)</a> codes, as used by the World Health Organization (WHO). The GBD methodology states that &quot;each death is attributed to a single underlying cause &#x2014; the cause that initiated the series of events leading to death&#x2014;in accordance with ICD principles&quot;. The GBD has developed a comprehensive and in-depth database with regards to mortality and attributed causes, utilising data from various&#xA0; sources. These sources include vital registration (VR); verbal autopsy (VA); surveillance, census and survey data; cancer registries; and police records. GBD then develops a data standardisation and processing methodology within which they define data quality and completeness scores, and where necessary&#xA0;adjust completeness to 100% using cause fractions for a given location-age-sex-year and estimated all-cause mortality for that location-age-sex-year.</p>
<p>An important step in the GBD methodology standardisation is in reallocating deaths attributed within ICD classifications without an underlying cause of death (for example, senility) which can be intermediate but not final cause of death. These categories are termed as &apos;garbage codes&apos;. GBD redistribute these garbage codes using a methodology explained in detail in Naghavi et al. (2010).<a id="ref-2" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-2"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">2</sup></a> Note that this redistributing of &apos;garbage codes&apos; in some cases explains the difference in estimates between IHME and WHO, such as for road accident deaths (compared <a href="/causes-of-death#road-accidents-ihme-vs-who-statistics">below</a>).</p>
<p>Death and death rates analyses are then carried out by GBD across locations, age, sex and year based on its&#xA0;Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm). Full description of GBD methodology can be found <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32152-9.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors"><a class="deep-link" href="#estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors"></a>II.2 Estimating deaths attributed to risk factors</h3>
<p>Estimating and attributing relative risk factors to number of deaths is a complex task&#xA0;&#x2014; particularly when risk factors can compound and collectively influence the likelihood of disease burden. The IHME&apos;s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies provide one of, if not the, most in-depth analysis and synthesis of relative risk factors.<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a> IHME differentiate risk factors into four broad categories:&#xA0;behavioural, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks.</p>
<p>IHME have developed a Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) conceptual framework<a id="ref-4" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-4"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">4</sup></a> by which they have built a web of risk factors or causes which affect health outcomes. For example, there is evidence of links between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular disease, ischemic stroke and some cancers.<a id="ref-5" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-5"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">5</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-6" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-6"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">6</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-7" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-7"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">7</sup></a></p>
<p>Such risk-outcome pairs (e.g. high BMI and ischemic stroke) are formed based on evidence links using methods such as cohort studies, randomised trials, and case-control studies. Once a risk-outcome pair has been formed, how does IHME begin to quantify the disease burden or number of deaths attributed to each risk? The CRA can be used for two different types of assessment: <strong>attributable burden</strong> and <strong>avoidable burden</strong>. &apos;Attributable burden&apos; represents the reduction in current disease burden (or that of a given year) if population exposure had shifted to another counterfactual/hypothetical exposure level; &apos;avoidable burden&apos; represents the potential future avoided burden if population exposure was to shift to a counterfactual level of exposure. Since the number of deaths is based on current or historical data, the data presented here is that of&#xA0;<strong>attributable burden</strong>.</p>
<p>Attributable burden effectively asks the question: &quot;what would the number of deaths from ischemic stroke be if everyone&apos;s body-mass index (BMI) was reduced to a healthy/optimal level (within range)?&quot; This healthy/optimal level is defined as the &apos;<strong>theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL)</strong>&apos;. Cohort, case studies and trials of established risk-exposure relationships between BMI and ischemic stroke allow for the calculation of the reduction in deaths which would have occurred if BMI was reduced to a healthy level across the population distribution. This relationship can be established by specific demographic groups, such as by sex or age. The difference between the number of deaths from ischemic stroke which would have occurred at the TMREL and at the actual BMI distribution is given as the number of deaths attributed to high BMI from ischemic stroke.</p>
<p>By completing this process for all risk-outcome pairs, IHME can sum to estimate the total number of deaths attributed to high BMI, and replicated for all risk factors using their individual risk-outcome exposure curves. Note that this process of estimation is not additive; in other words, these risk-specific relationships do not account for the compounding effects of multiple risk factors. High BMI, for example, may likely be present with other lifestyle factors such as low physical activity levels, high blood pressure, low fruit and vegetable intake. All of these estimates are developed independently. We cannot therefore sum all &apos;attributed deaths&apos; and conclude that this is the actual number of deaths. The attributed number of deaths by risk factor in many cases exceeds that of those by cause of death.</p>
<p>Full methodological explanation of the IHME&apos;s approach to risk factor attribution can be found <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32366-8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
