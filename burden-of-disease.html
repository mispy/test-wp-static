<section><h2>Empirical View</h2><h3>The global burden of disease is huge</h3><p>How many healthy life years are lost due to diseases, deaths, and injuries? It is a daring question, but we actually do have a good answer to it. The <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">Global Burden of Disease</a> estimated that in&#xA0;23.5% of potential life years were lost due to premature death in the year 2013. Another 10.7% of potential healthy life years were lost due to disease and disability.</p><p>This means that in sum more than a third of potential healthy life years were lost. The global burden of disease was 34.2% in 2013.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9547" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-750x525.png" alt="2-dalys-lost-globally-in-2013" width="750" height="525" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2-DALYs-lost-globally-in-2013-768x538.png 768w"></a></p><h3>The distribution of the global burden of disease</h3><p>The visualisation below shows the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost per 100,000.<br>

Communicable diseases are often curable and better public health can reduce the burden considerably yet many poor countries still suffer from the burden of these diseases.<br>

A dedicated <a href="http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/">IHME website</a> provides a fascinating interactive tool to explore all available data on burden of disease worldwide.</p><p>As the chart below shows, different conditions contribute differently to health outcomes depending on the specific country and gender. While in Angola there are clear challenges relating to HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea and malaria, in countries such as the US or Germany, the biggest challenges relate to cardiovascular and respiratory disease and cancer (the main cause of &apos;neoplasms&apos;).</p><h6>Burden of disease by cause, country, and gender (2013 estimates) &#x2013; produced by <a href="http://ihmeuw.org/3vly">IHME Viz Hub</a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8505" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown.png" alt="IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown" width="4250" height="3600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-150x127.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-400x339.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-649x550.png 649w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IHME_BurdenOfDisease_breakdown-768x651.png 768w"></a></p><p><!------------------------------><br>

<section><h2>Correlates, Determinants, &amp; Consequences</h2><h3>Average&#xA0;income and the Burden of Disease</h3><p>The visualisation below shows the&#xA0;relationship between average income &#x2013; measured by GNI per capita &#x2013; and the Burden of Disease. The Burden of Disease is disaggregated into the health burden due to communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases.</p><p>The&#xA0;chart shows that communicable diseases in particular are closely correlated to average income levels. The relationship that was estimated by Sterck et al. 2017<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a> is shown in the legend.&#xA0;GNI per capita has a strong negative correlation with log DALYs lost due to communicable diseases with an elasticity of -0&#xB7;88.&#xA0;On the other hand, the non-communicable disease burden is much less strongly associated with average income (the elasticity is estimated to be&#xA0;-0&#xB7;13). Another conclusion we can draw from&#xA0;this chart is that the relationship between GNI per capita and DALYs lost due to the disease burden of communicable diseases&#xA0;is best captured by a log-log function.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9989" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-750x532.png" alt="" width="750" height="532" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-150x106.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-400x284.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-750x532.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lin-DALYs-vs-lin-GNI-final-768x545.png 768w"></a></p><h3>Average income and the Burden of Disease due to&#xA0;communicable diseases</h3><p>The health burden due to communicable diseases vs GDP per capita&#xA0;is shown in the following visualisation. The&#xA0;correlation between both measures is&#xA0;apparent from the visualisation. But despite this correlation, Sterck et al. 2017<a id="ref-2" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-2"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">2</sup></a> find that GNI is not a significant predictor of health outcomes once other factors are controlled for. The first of these other factors is&#xA0;individual poverty &#x2013; relative to a health poverty line of 10.89 international-$ per day. The second factor is&#xA0;the epidemiological surrounding of a country which captures the health status of neighbouring countries. And the third important factor is&#xA0;institutional capacity.<br>

<section><h2>Measurement, Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2><p>Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost&#xA0;is&#xA0;a standardized metric allowing for direct comparison and summing of burdens of different diseases. Conceptually, one DALY is the equivalent of one year in good health lost because of premature mortality or disability (see Murray et al. 2015<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a>). Assessing health outcomes by both mortality and morbidity provides a more encompassing view on health outcomes than only looking at mortality or life expectancy alone.</p><p>Three categories of health conditions are distinguished:</p><ol>
<li>Group I DALYs lost due to communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions;</li>
<li>DALYs lost due to non-communicable diseases (NCD);</li>
<li>DALYs lost due to injuries. Our main analysis focuses on Group I DALYs. <!------------------------------><br>
