For example, the difference in levels between neighboring Schleswig-Holstein (in West Germany) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in East Germany) are similar to the difference between <a href="/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder">Sweden and the US</a> &#x2013; a considerable contrast in self-reported life satisfaction.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-Gluecksatlas.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11335" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-Gluecksatlas-379x550.png" alt="" width="500" height="725.6"></a><br>
Several academic studies have looked more closely at this &apos;happiness gap&apos; in Germany using data from more detailed surveys, such as the German Socio-Economic Panel (e.g. Petrunyk and Pfeifer 2016).<a id="ref-2" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-2"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">2</sup></a> These studies provide two main insights:</p><p>First, the gap is partly driven by differences in household income and employment. But this is not the only aspect; even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic differences, the East-West gap remains significant.</p><p>And second, the gap has been narrowing in recent years. In fact, the finding that the gap is narrowing is true both for the raw average differences, as well as for the &apos;conditional differences&apos; (i.e. the differences that are estimated after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics). The following charts shows this.</p><h6>Trends in life satisfaction for East and West Germany, 1992-2013</h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/East-West-German-Happiness-gaps-Petrunyk-and-Pfeifer-2016.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11307 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/East-West-German-Happiness-gaps-Petrunyk-and-Pfeifer-2016-357x550.png" alt="" width="357" height="550"></a></p><p>The observation that socioeconomic and demographic differences do not fully predict the observed East-West differences in self-reported happiness is related to a broader empirical phenomenon: Culture and history matter for self-reported life satisfaction&#x2014;and in particular, ex-communist countries tend to have a lower subjective well-being than other countries with comparable levels of economic development.
