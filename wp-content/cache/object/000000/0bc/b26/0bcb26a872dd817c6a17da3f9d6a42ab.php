This presentation presents empirical data showing that we are now living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The past was not peaceful</h3>
It would be wrong to believe that the past was peaceful. One reason why some people might have this impression is that many of the past conflicts feature less prominently in our memories, they are simply forgotten.

An overview of all the conflicts that we have historical knowledge and an estimate of the number of fatalities of is shown in the visualization below.

The red circles visualize all conflicts in the Conflict Catalog (<a href="http://www.cgeh.nl/data#conflict">here</a>) authored by Peter Brecke. Brecke's dataset contains information on 3708 conflicts, but in the more distant past it is still incomplete and for many past conflicts Brecke is either lacking an estimate of the number of fatalities or we can suspect that entire conflicts are completely unknown.
<h6>Global deaths in conflicts, since 1400¬†‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The Conflict Catalog (Violent Conflicts 1400 A.D. to the Present in Different Regions of the World) authored by Peter Brecke contains information on 3708 conflicts, data on parties, fatalities, date and duration between the year 1400 and 2000.
It is available at the Center for Global Economic History <a href="http://www.cgeh.nl/data#conflict">here</a>.

The data on the military death rate after 1946 is taken from the Human Security Report Project, which takes data from the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset v.3.0. The page presenting this data is online <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/Deaths-from-Organized-Violence.aspx">here</a>.[/ref]

<h3>In Europe the second half of the 20th century was extraordinarily peaceful</h3>
The following Gantt chart shows the years in which European countries (or their predecessor states) took part in an international wars. Below the country-by-country visualization we see the sum (per half century) of all years in which European countries fought wars.
