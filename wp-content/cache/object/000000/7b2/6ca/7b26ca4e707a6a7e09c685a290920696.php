<h3>Famines since 1850 ‚Äì Global View</h3>
<h6>The number of famine victims by decade, 1860s-2000s ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
<p>The data is taken from the table of famines that you find in this data entry.</p>
<p>If a range of victims is shown in the table above then I have taken the average of this range. For famines that happened at the end of a decade and the beginning of the next decade I have counted half of the famine victims in each decade.</p>
<p>For many of the famines the number of victims is not known, so I have not included the victims of these famines in this chart. The numbers here ‚Äì especially for the earlier decades ‚Äì should therefore considered as lower bounds of the true number of famine victims.[/ref]<br />

<h3>Famines over the Long Run</h3>
<h4>Global View</h4>
<p>Wikipedia presents a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines">list of famines</a> that covers more than 2 millenia.</p>
<h4>Single Countries</h4>
<p>Saito (2010) has created a chronology of famines in Japan since the 6th century. Before the 14th century data is judged to be incomplete (although the records for the 8th and 9th are surprisingly complete ‚Äì there were more than 35 famines in each of the two centuries. Overall Saito's chronology comprises information on 281 famines. None of these 281 famines happened in the 20th century but the following graph shows that the end of hunger in Japan arrived gradually. Before 1550 there were more than 10 famines per 50 years ‚Äì since then famines became less and less common in Japan.</p>

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Definition of Famine</h3>
<p>According to Cormac √ì Gr√°da[ref]Cormac √ì Gr√°da (2009) ‚Äì Famine: A Short History. Princeton University Press. The book's website is <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8857.html">here</a>.[/ref] famine refers to 'a shortage of food or purchasing power that leads directly to excess mortality from starvation or hunger-induced diseases'. It is not always straightforward to distinguish it from malnutrition that is described in a <a title="Hunger and Undernourishment" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/hunger-and-undernourishment/">different entry in this website</a>. The distinguishing feature between malnutrition and a famine is the latter's crisis character.<br />
Generally a famine is more severe than malnutrition ‚Äì √ì Gr√°da is more specific in this respect and according to him a famine is characterised by 3 features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 'daily death rate above 1 per 10.000 population',</li>
<li>The 'proportion of "wasted" children [that is, children weighing two standard deviations or more below the average] above 20 percent'[ref]Wasting is sometimes referred to as "acute malnutrition". <a href="http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_115.htm">The 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine' explains it <em>here</em></a>: 'wasting results from an acute shortage of food, is reversible with refeeding, and has a relatively high mortality rate'. This is different from stunting which is a chronic symptom of persistent malnutrition and less associated with food crises.[/ref]</li>
<li>'Prevalence of kwashiorkor' (extreme form of malnutrition mainly affecting young children).[ref]Kwashiorkor is explained <a href="http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_116.htm">here at the open-access educational resources for policy-makers provided by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>.[/ref]</li>
</ol>
<p>According to O Grada a 'severe famine' means</p>
<ol>
<li>A daily death rate of above 5 / 10.000,</li>
<li>A proportion of wasted children above 40 percent, and</li>
<li>Again, the prevalence of kwashiorkor.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Comparability Across Time</h3>
<p>In the study of famines of the past historical myopia is a severe problem.¬†Loveday, an early researcher of Indian famines, noted in 1914, "The frequency of the mention of famine in the later history . . . increases in exact proportion with the precision and accuracy in detail of her historians."[ref]Loveday (1914) page 10 as cited in √ì Gr√°da ‚Äì (2007).</p>
