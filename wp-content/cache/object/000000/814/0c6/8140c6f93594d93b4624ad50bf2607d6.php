This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Happiness and Life Satisfaction</a></strong>.</div>
In global surveys of happiness and life satisfaction, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Germany usually ranks high</a>. However, these national averages mask large inequalities. In the map below we focus on regional inequalitiesâ€”specifically the gap in life satisfaction between West and East Germany.

The map below plots self-reported life satisfaction in Germany (using the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/#is-life-satisfaction-the-same-as-happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0-10 Cantril Ladder question</a>), aggregating averages scores at the level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal States</a>.[ref]In some cases, the underlying data had multiple average estimates for the same territory (e.g. Baden and WÃ¼rttemberg were treated as different entities). In these cases the map shows the average between these two observations. Details can be found in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-data.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this file</a>[/ref] The first thing that stands out is a clear divide between the East and the West, along the political division that existed before the reunification of Germany in 1990.
For example, the difference in levels between neighboring Schleswig-Holstein (in West Germany) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in East Germany) are similar to the difference between <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder">Sweden and the US</a> â€“ a considerable contrast in self-reported life satisfaction.

Several academic studies have looked more closely at this 'happiness gap' in Germany using data from more detailed surveys, such as the German Socio-Economic Panel (e.g. Petrunyk and Pfeifer 2016).[ref]Petrunyk, I., &amp; Pfeifer, C. (2016). Life satisfaction in Germany after reunification: Additional insights on the pattern of convergence. JahrbÃ¼cher fÃ¼r NationalÃ¶konomie und Statistik, 236(2), 217-239.[/ref] These studies provide two main insights:

First, the gap is partly driven by differences in household income and employment. But this is not the only aspect; even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic differences, the East-West gap remains significant.

And second, the gap has been narrowing in recent years. In fact, the finding that the gap is narrowing is true both for the raw average differences, as well as for the 'conditional differences' (i.e. the differences that are estimated after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics). The following charts shows this.

The observation that socioeconomic and demographic differences do not fully predict the observed East-West differences in self-reported happiness is related to a broader empirical phenomenon: Culture and history matter for self-reported life satisfactionâ€”and in particular, ex-communist countries tend to have a lower subjective well-being than other countries with comparable levels of economic development.
