&nbsp;

These were the highlights for me:
<ul>
 	<li>We have written a series of new entries and updated existing ones. This was possible thanks to Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, who joined the team in 2016:
1. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/">Health</a>
2. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education">Education</a>
3. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade">Trade</a>
4. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/">Poverty</a>
5. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/">Inequality</a>
6. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/">Taxation</a>
7. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/">Public Spending</a>
8. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/corruption/">Corruption</a>
9. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide/">Suicide</a>
10. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/">Population Growth</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Thanks to Jaiden Mispy, who also joined in 2016, the web-framework of our publication got much better.</li>
</ul>
Most importantly he redesigned the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher/">OWID-grapher,</a> the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/slides/global-health/#/title-slide">presentations</a> and the Wordpress theme. Speed is improved and he managed to make the page useful on mobile phones and tablets.
He set up proper caching (through¬† Cloudflare) so that the site can serve thousands of people and still be fast. And he made a series of stability improvements, bugfixes and small feature additions to interactive visualizations.
Jaiden is already working on further improvements, currently he is working on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-vs-healthcare-expenditure">labelled timeline scatterplots.</a>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>We were very happy that in the new academic year many used our material for teaching. We saw that the page got accessed at many universities, and we got very nice feedback from students and lecturers.</li>
 	<li>I collaborated with the team from 'Kurz Gesagt' to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348">video on population growth</a>.</li>
 	<li>We launched <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/title-slide">AfricaInData.org</a> ‚Äì a short presentation on how Africa is changing.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

I am very much looking forward to the work on Our World in Data in 2017! If you have requests and ideas let us know ‚Äì there is a feedback option below or just send us an email.

Big thanks to Jaiden and Esteban for their work! It is great working in a team!

And big thanks to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/supporters/">all of you who donated</a>!
