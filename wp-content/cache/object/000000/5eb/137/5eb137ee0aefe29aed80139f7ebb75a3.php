There are three primary determinants of global population growth: mortality, fertility, and population momentum. The global improvement falling mortality ‚Äì seen in increasing life expectancy around the world and falling <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a>¬†in every country ‚Äì contribute to an increase of the world population. The decline of fertility rates on the other hand, ‚Äì the number of children per woman ‚Äì reduces population growth. The global average fertility rate was 5 children per woman until the end of the 1960s and has halved since then.

The UN projections for the global population growth rates, which have been produced since the 1950s, have a good track record in projecting the size of the global population as we will show in the last part of this entry.

<h3>The Three Drivers of World Population Growth: The Fertility Rate, Life Expectancy, &amp; Population Momentum</h3>
Population growth is driven by three different factors: mortality, fertility, and population momentum.
<h4>The World Fertility Rate</h4>
The visualization below shows the total fertility rate by the level of development and includes the UN projections through 2100. Until 1950 the fertility rate in the 'more developed regions' had already declined to less than 3 children per woman. Then in the 1960s the fertility rate in the 'less developed regions' started to fall and another decade later the fertility rate in the 'least developed regions' followed this decline.

The fertility rate of the world was still at 5 children per woman until the mid-1960s. Since then the fertility rate has halved and is today below 2.5 children per woman.

<h4>The fertility rate by world region</h4>
Fertility is driven by the socio-economic development of the population, especially the status and wellbeing of women. Accordingly, the early developing populations started the transition much earlier than world regions that remained poor for a longer time. Europeans and Northern Americas reached the replacement rate at a time when fertility only started to decline in Asia and Latin America. Africa, where poverty and lack of education persisted even longer, was the last continent to experience a decreasing fertility rate.

<h4>The World Life Expectancy</h4>
As health is rapidly improving around the world, life expectancy is also increasing rapidly. You can read more about life expectancy at the our <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">life expectancy data entry</a>.

<h3>What matters for the size of the world population is fertility not mortatlity</h3>
Mortality is even inversely correlated with population growth
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-population-growth" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Where fertility is high population growth is high. This correlation is as strong as correlations in social science can ever be.

<h3>The different variants of population projections by the UN</h3>
Shown below is the increase of the world population since 1750 combined with the latest projections of the UN Population Division.

The UN publishes several variants of their population projections:
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>Medium Variant</strong> is the projection that the UN researchers see as the most likely scenario.</li>
 	<li>The <strong>High-</strong> and <strong>Low-Variants</strong>¬†are based on the Medium Variant and simply assume that the total fertility rates in each country are 0.5 higher and 0.5 lower than the Medium variant by the end of this century in every country.[ref]This is described in¬†Samir KC and Wolfgang Lutz (2017) ‚Äì The human core of the shared socioeconomic pathways: Population scenarios by age, sex and level of education for all countries to 2100. Glob Environ Change. 2017 Jan; 42: 181‚Äì192. doi: 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.06.004. And it is also clear from the TFR projections of the UN.[/ref]</li>
 	<li>The <strong>Constant Fertility Scenario</strong> is an illustrative scenario that plays out how the world population would change if fertility rates remained constant. It is obviously not intended to be a realistic scenario.</li>
</ul>

As shown above, changes in <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> and <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/fertility-rates/">fertility rates</a> determine population growth. The data entry on past <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/#correlates-determinants-consequences">world population growth</a> discusses the demographic transition as the central concept that explains population growth.
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Institutions that publish population projections</h3>
The most widely discussed projections are those published by the United Nations, the first of which were published already in 1951. The UN projections are called 'assessments' and a new update is published in their <em>World Population Prospects</em> series every two years. The scenario which the UN researchers see as the most likely scenario is the Medium Variant projection. But in addition to their main Medium projection the UN Population Division are additionally publishing a High and Low variant, which simply assume that the total fertility rates are 0.5 higher and 0.5 lower than the Medium variant by the end of this century in every country.

But there are also a number of other institutions that are preparing their own projections of the world population. Global population projections are also published by the US Census, the Population Reference Bureau (PRB), and by the closely related Austrian research centers IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre. The World Bank also published projections for some time but has stopped doing so in the mid‚Äì90s.
<h3>The WC-IIASA projections: How investments in education matter for the global population in the 21st century</h3>
A set of influential projections is published by IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre, which I refer to as the WC-IIASA projections.[ref] These projections are presented in detail in Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC <a href="2014">Editors</a> ‚Äì World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press.

The website of the book is here:¬†<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/world-population-and-human-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century‚Äì9780198703167?cc=at&amp;lang=en&amp;">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/world-population-and-human-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century‚Äì9780198703167?cc=at&amp;lang=en&amp;</a>

The work is produced at two closely related research centers in Austria:
<ol>
 	<li>The first of these institutions is the <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Introduction.html">World Population Program (POP)</a> at the <em>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</em> (IIASA).</li>
 	<li>And the second institution is the <em><a href="http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm">Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital</a>.</em></li>
</ol>
Available are these projections <a href="http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/shiny/wic/">here</a>.[/ref]

Projections of the global population are uncertain and much of the uncertainty comes from the fact that we do not know which investments the world will make in those systems that determine mortality and fertility ‚Äì most importantly in education, as we have just seen.

The WC-IIASA projections differ from the work of the United Nations in a number of <a href="https://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">fundamental ways</a>. The UN projections are taking into account the empirical data on each country‚Äôs demography and are building projections based on this quantitative information. In contrast to this the WC-IIASA projections are also taking into account the qualitative assessments of 550 demographers from around the world which the WC-IIASA researchers have surveyed to gather their ideas on how the population change in different parts of the world will play out. They then combine the country specific expertise of these researchers with similar quantitative information that the UN and others rely on as well.[ref]The assumptions behind the projections are presented in more detail in Wolfgang¬†Lutz and Samir KC (2017) ‚Äì The human core of the shared socioeconomic pathways: Population scenarios by age, sex and level of education for all countries to 2100. In Global Environmental Change Volume 42, January 2017, Pages 181‚Äì192.

The work by WC-IIASA is highly respected among demographers and key publications by the researchers are regularly published in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.[ref] Lutz, W., Sanderson, W. C., &amp; Scherbov, S. (1997). Doubling of world population unlikely. Nature, 387(6635), 803‚Äì805.

The WC-IIASA projections are taking into account the demographic structure of the educational attainment of the population. While other projections are only structuring the demographic data by sex and age-group, the WC-IIASA data is additionally breaking down the population data by the level of highest educational attainment of different parts of the population. This information on educational attainment is then used for both the output of the model ‚Äì so that population projections for each country of the world by highest educational attainment are available (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">also on Our World in Data</a>). And crucially the information on education is also used as an an input into the model, so that the impact of different future scenarios for education on both mortality and fertility can be modeled explicitly.

The level of highest educational attainment is categorized in a system that aims to capture the structure of populations across the different country-specific educational systems. These categorizations are based on the the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which was designed by the UNESCO to make education statistics comparable across countries. WC-IIASA breaks down the educational structure into the following 6 categories and the table summarizes how the six categories are defined, how they correspond to ISCED 1997, and the main allocation rules the researchers used.

For children younger than 15 years old no educational attainment information is available as most of them are still in the process of education.
<h4 id="fourfuturescenariosforglobaleducation">The four scenarios for global education by WC-IIASA</h4>
Projections of the global population take into account how the fertility rate will change in each country over the coming decades. The WC-IIASA projections are particularly helpful for the discussion here as they are the only projections that break down the demographic projections by the educational level of the populations and then model how different educational scenarios would affect the fertility rate in countries across the world. This then allows comparisons of how education matters for the size and distribution of the future population of the planet.

The researchers developed 4 different basic scenarios and a larger number of combinations based on these scenarios:

<strong>Constant Enrollment Numbers (CEN):</strong> This is the researcher's most pessimistic scenario. Here it is assumed that no more schools are being opened in any place in the world so that the absolute number of people reaching a particular educational level is frozen at the current number. This means that enrollment rates are declining when the population size increases.
In practice the WC-IIASA researchers almost always consider CER as the most pessimistic scenario and only rarely discuss CEN.

<strong>Constant Enrollment Rates (CER)</strong>: This is another pessimistic scenario. While in the CEN scenario the absolute <em>number</em>¬†of enrolled students stagnates, the assumption in the CER scenario is that the <em>rate </em>of enrollment stagnates. In this scenario the most recently observed rates of educational enrollment are frozen at their current rate and no further improvement in enrollment is assumed.
This will still result in further improvements of adult education because in many countries the younger cohorts are better educated than the older ones. But in the longer run this scenario also implies stagnation.

<strong>Fast Track (FT):</strong> This scenario is the most optimistic one and here it is assumed that countries follow the most rapid education expansion achieved in recent history which is that of South Korea.

<strong>Global Education Trend (GET):</strong> This is the middle scenario and here the researchers assume that countries will follow the average path of educational expansion that other countries already further advanced in this process have experienced.¬†In this scenario the researchers project the medium future trajectory based on the experience of all countries over the past 40 years
The researchers write:¬†‚ÄúThe GET scenario is moderately optimistic, and can be considered as the most likely.‚Äù[ref]Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC [Editors] (2014)¬†‚Äì Executive Summary: World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press. <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf</a>[/ref]
<h3>The track record of the UN projections</h3>
<h4>Global population growth</h4>
In a 2001 paper, Nico Keilman assessed the projections of the global demographic changes that the UN published between 1951 and 1998.[ref]Keilman (2001) - Data quality and accuracy of United Nations population projections, 1950-95. In Population Studies, 55, 2, 149--164.[/ref] The next graph shows the increase of the world population (solid black line) along with the UN projections published between 1950 and 1980. With the exception of the projection "1950 I", which relied on poor data ‚Äì especially for China ‚Äì the forecasts are remarkably accurate. Even the 1950 III forecast that was made with better information on China after the 1953 Census is not far off for the population size half a century later.

Nevertheless it is interesting to see that over the first decades the UN underestimated the population growth and for the last period they overestimated the world population. Why this happened becomes clearer if we look at the projections for the world fertility rate and global life expectancy.

<h4>Global average fertility rate and life expectancy</h4>
Keilman also studied the two drivers of population growth separately and this can help to explain why the UN first underestimated the population growth and then overestimated the population.

As shown in the following graph he finds that the UN underestimated the rapid fall of world fertility.

And as shown in the graph below the UN underestimated the rise of global life expectancy.

The UN were too pessimistic in both aspects as Keilman notes: The "projection makers have been too pessimistic about future mortality" and "predicted life expectancy levels that were too low on average ‚Äì much too low in many cases".

On a regional level the study finds that "not surprisingly, problems are largest in pre-transition countries, and especially in Asia".
