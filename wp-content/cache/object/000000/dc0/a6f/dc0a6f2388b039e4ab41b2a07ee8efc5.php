<strong>Mental health is a complex issue that affects a large number of people across a range of disorders. The objective of this data entry is to contribute to an informed, open debate about the prevalence and impacts of mental health disorders. Mental health disorders can, in some cases, be connected with suicide or suicidal thoughts. If you are dealing with suicidal thoughts you can receive immediate help by visiting resources such as Suicide.org, or by calling 1-800-SUICIDE in the US.</strong>

Mental health and substance use disorders combined rank as the 5th largest loss (as measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years; DALYs) of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-total-disease-burden-by-cause">disease burden</a> at the global level. Across many countries, this disease burden can rank within the top three. Mental health and substance use disorders are nonetheless still significantly under-reported. This is true across all countries, but particularly at lower incomes where data is more scarce, and attention and treatment for mental health disorders are significantly lower.

In this entry we present the latest estimates of mental health disorder prevalence, disease burden rates, and mortality impacts across a number of disorders. We address substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use disorders) in a separate entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Use</a>.

Mental health disorders are complex and can take many forms. The underlying sources of the data presented in this entry apply specific definitions (which we describe <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#definitions-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">here</a>), typically in accordance withÂ WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). This broad definition incorporates many forms, including mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, bipolar, eating disorders and schizophrenia), as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and developmental intellectual disabilities. The presentation of this diverse range of disorders, as categorised by the World Health Organization does not imply that they are comparable, or that their impacts and potential approaches of support or treatment should be treated similarly.

The complexity of mental health disorders means that the use of such definitions are also likely to underestimate its prevalence; many cases will undoubtedly fall outwith these definitions, but does not preclude them from being recognised as mental health disorders.

Mental health disorders remain widely under-reportedÂ â€” in our section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#data-availability-on-mental-health">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> we discuss the challenges of dealing with this data. In many cases, we may therefore consider reported estimates to be an under-estimation of true prevalence and disease burden. Even taking this into account, the data presented in this entry demonstrate that mental health disorders are common and have a high prevalence. Improving awareness, recognition, support and treatment for this range of disorders should therefore be an essential focus for global health.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<!------------------------->
<h3>Prevalence of mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders</h3>
The category of mental health and substance use disorders comprises a range of disorders including depression, anxiety, bipolar, eating disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual developmental disability, and alcohol and drug use disorders. Full definitions of disorders used by the Institute for Health and Metrics Evaluation (IHME) can be found in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#definitions-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">Data Quality and Definitions</a> section.

In this entry, we focus only on mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders â€” specific data on alcohol and drug use disorders can be found in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use">Substance Use</a>. You can find statistics on the combined prevalence of all of these disorders (including substance use) can be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found here</a>; across most countries, approximately 15-20 percent of the population are experiencing a mental health and/or substance use disorder. This equates to every fifth or sixth person.

After exclusion of substance use disorders, we see the share of the population with at least one of the range of mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across the world, mental health disorders are very common. The highest reported prevalence is Iran, Australia and New Zealand, where around every 5th or 6th person is experiencing one or more within this group of disorders. These are, however, not large outliers.

Also shown below we see the prevalence of these disorders in males and females. Collectively, we see that across the range of disorders, prevalence is mixed between males and females. However, as is shown later in this entry this varies significantly by disorder type: on average, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder is more prevalent in women. Gender differences in schizophrenia prevalence are mixed across countries.

<h4>Number of people with mental and neurodevelopmental disorders</h4>
It's estimated that, globally, close to 950 million people have a mental or neurodevelopmental disorder (this is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-with-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">over 1.1 billion</a> when substance use disorders are included). This split between males and females is similar, with an estimated 486 million females, and 462 million males in 2016. The relative under-reporting of these disorders means it's challenging to give a highly accurate measure of this change over time. Nonetheless, IHME estimates that this represents an increase from around 652 million in 1990.

You can view these statistics for any country using the "change country" function in the chart below.

<h3>Disease burden of mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders</h3>
Health impacts are often measured in terms of total numbers of deaths. It has been strongly argued that such metrics significantly underestimate the impact of mental health disorders for two reasons.[ref]Prince, M., Patel, V., Saxena, S., Maj, M., Maselko, J., Phillips, M. R., &amp; Rahman, A. (2007). No health without mental health.Â <i>The Lancet</i>,Â <i>370</i>(9590), 859-877. Available <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61238-0/fulltext">online</a>.[/ref] The first is that from the perspective of mortality, direct deaths typically only result from alcohol, drug use and eating disorders. However, suicide deaths are also strongly linkedÂ â€” although not always attributed toÂ â€” mental health disorders. We discuss the evidence of this link between mental health and suicide <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#link-between-mental-health-and-suicide">later in this entry</a>. It is nonetheless recognised that a given share of suicide deaths are attributed to this group of disorders; including this proportion of suicides would significantly increase the total attributed number of deaths.

It is also true that the metric of mortality fails to capture the true health and wellbeing costs of mental health disorders. In the charts below we present data on the attributed '<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease">disease burden</a>' (measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years; DALYs). This metric considers not only death rates, but also years lived with disability or health burden. As a share of total disease burden, mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders typically account for 7-10 percent, but up to 13 percent in some countries.

<h3>Depression</h3>
The series of charts below present latest global estimates of the prevalence and disease burden of depressive disorders. Depressive disorders, as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#definitions-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">defined by the underlying source</a>, cover a spectrum of severity ranging from mild persistent depression (dysthymia) to major (severe) depressive disorder. The data presented below includes all across this spectrum.

<h3>Anxiety disorders</h3>
Anxiety disorders arise in a number of forms including phobic, social, obsessive compulsive (OCD), post-traumatic disorder (PTSD), or generalized anxiety disorders. The symptoms and diagnostic criteria for each subset of anxiety disorders are unique.

The series of charts below present global data on the prevalence and disease burden which results from this range of anxiety disorders.

<h3>Bipolar disorder</h3>
Bipolar disorder (also known as bipolar affective disorder) <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#definitions-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">is defined by</a> WHO International Classification of Diseases as being characterized by "repeated (i.e. at least two) episodes in which the patient's mood and activity levels are significantly disturbed, this disturbance consisting on some occasions of an elevation of mood and increased energy and activity (mania or hypomania), and on others of a lowering of mood and decreased energy and activity (depression)."

The charts below present global data on the prevalence and disease burden of bipolar disorder.

<h3>Eating disorders</h3>
Eating disorders are defined as psychiatric conditions defined by patterns of disordered eating. This therefore incorporates a spectrum of disordered eating behaviours. The underlying sources presented here present data only for the disorders of anorexia and bulimia nervosa (defined in our definitions section <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#definitions-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">here</a>). It is however recognised that a large share of eating disorders fall outwith the definition of either anorexia or bulimia nervosa (these are often termed 'eating disorders not otherwise specified'; EDNOS)Â â€” some estimates report at least 60 percent of eating disorders do not meet the standard criteria.[ref]Brooks, S. J., Rask-Andersen, M., Benedict, C., &amp; SchiÃ¶th, H. B. (2012). A debate on current eating disorder diagnoses in light of neurobiological findings: is it time for a spectrum model?.Â <i>BMC psychiatry</i>,Â <i>12</i>(1), 76. Available <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-12-76">online</a>.[/ref]

It is therefore expected that the data presented below significantly underestimates the true prevalence of eating disorders, since it concerns only clinically-diagnosed anorexia and bulimia nervosa.

<h3>Schizophrenia</h3>
Schizophrenia is typically diagnosed following reports of at least one very clear symptom (and usually two or more if less clear-cut) from the list of symptoms given in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#definitions-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> section. The following charts present global-level data on the prevalence and disease burden of schizophrenia.

<h3>Autistic spectrum disorders</h3>
Autistic disorders lie on a spectrum, which differ in terms of severity and characteristic behaviours. The term 'autistic spectrum disorder' includes those with autism (both childhood and atypical), and Asperger Syndrome or other autistic spectrum disorders. 'Autism' is defined byÂ characteristics of abnormal functioning in all three areas of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviour. Asperger syndrome is classified as part of the spectrum of autistic disorders but differs from autism primarily in that there is no general delay or retardation in language or in cognitive development.

The charts below present global level data on the prevalence of autistic disorders, as well as autism and Asperger syndrome specifically.

<h3>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD)</h3>
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), sometimes known as 'hyperkinetic disorders' are characterised by a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behaviour with marked inattention and lack of persistent task involvement; and pervasiveness over situations and persistence over time of these behavioural characteristics. The chart below present global-level data on the prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD).

<h3>Developmental intellectual disability</h3>
The Institute of Health Metrics (IHME) and the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD) define a broad category of 'idiopathic developmental intellectual disability' which are defined by delayed or impaired speech, language, motor condition, and visuo-spatial skills. The prevalence of this group of disorders are shown in the visualisations below.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Risk factors for mental health</h3>
The determinants, onset and severity of mental health disorders are complex - they can rarely be attributed to a single factor. The World Health Organization synthesise the potential contributors to mental health and wellbeing into three categories[ref]Risks to mental health: an overview of vulnerabilities and risk factors (2012). World Health Organization. Available <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/risks_to_mental_health_EN_27_08_12.pdf">online</a>.[/ref]:
<ul>
 	<li>individual attributes and behaviours: these can be particular genetic factors or personality traits;</li>
 	<li>social and economic circumstances;</li>
 	<li>environmental factors.</li>
</ul>
In the table below we see the WHO's breakdown of potential adverse and protective factors for mental health within these three categories. It should be noted that these factors often interact, compound or negate one another and should therefore not be considered as individual traits or exposures. For example, particular individual traits may make a given person more vulnerable to mental health disorders with the onset of a particular economic or social scenarioÂ â€” the instance of one does not necessarily result in a mental health disorder, but combined there is a significantly higher vulnerability.
[table id=87 /]
<h4>Risk factors through the life-course</h4>
The risk factors and influencers on mental health vary significantly for an individual as they move through the life-course. The following are acknowledged risk factors for a given stage of life.[ref]Risks to mental health: an overview of vulnerabilities and risk factors (2012). World Health Organization. Available <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/risks_to_mental_health_EN_27_08_12.pdf">online</a>.[/ref]

<strong>Pre-conception and pre-natal period</strong>

A given individual's mental health and wellbeing can be influenced by factors present prior to conception or birth. Pregnancies which are unwanted or in adolescence can increase the likelihood of detrimental behaviours of the mother during pregnancy, and the environmental or family conditions of childhood.[ref]Kieling, C., Baker-Henningham, H., Belfer, M., Conti, G., Ertem, I., Omigbodun, O., ... &amp; Rahman, A.

Available <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/risks_to_mental_health_EN_27_08_12.pdf">online</a>.[/ref] During pregnancy, detrimental behaviours including tobacco, alcohol and drug use can increase the likelihood of later mental health disorders for children; malnutrition, low-birth weight and micronutrient deficiency (for example, iodine deficiency) can also influence later mental health vulnerabilities.[ref]Herrman, H., Saxena, S., Moodie, R., &amp; World Health Organization.

<strong>Infancy and early childhood</strong>

There is a large base of evidence which shows that emotional attachment in early childhood has a considerable impact on later vulnerability to mental health and wellbeing.[ref]Walker S, Wachs TD, Meeks Gardner J, Lozoff B, Wasserman GA, Pollitt E, Careter JA and the International Child Development Steering Group (2007). Child development: risk factors for adverse outcomes in developing countries. <em>The Lancet</em>, 369: 145-157.

Available <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60555-2/abstract">online</a>.[/ref] As a result, particular risk factors include separation from the primary caregiver, in some cases post-natal depression in mothers (which can result in sub-optimal attachment), and parents for whom communication and social interaction is challenging. Child maltreatment and neglect has been found to have a significant impact on vulnerabilities to mental wellbeing.[ref]Walker S, Wachs TD, Meeks Gardner J, Lozoff B, Wasserman GA, Pollitt E, Careter JA and the International Child Development Steering Group (2007). Child development: risk factors for adverse outcomes in developing countries. <em>The Lancet</em>, 369: 145-157.

<strong>Childhood</strong>

Childhood conditions form a critical component of health and wellbeing later in life. Negative experiences, either at home or outside of the home (for example, bullying in school) can have lifelong impacts on the development of core cognitive and emotional skills. Poor socioeconomic conditions also have a significant effect on vulnerability to mental health disorders; in a study in Sweden, the authors found that children raised in families of poor socioeconomic backgrounds had an increased risk of psychosis.[ref]Wicks, S., Hjern, A., &amp; Dalman, C. (2010). Social risk or genetic liability for psychosis? A study of children born in Sweden and reared by adoptive parents.Â <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i>,Â <i>167</i>(10), 1240-1246. Available <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09010114?code=ajp-site">online</a>.[/ref] Poor economic resources, shown through poor housing conditions for example, can be seen by children as shameful or degrading and affect aspects of childhood learning, communication and interaction with peers.

Children with a parent who has a mental illness or substance use disorder have a higher risk of psychiatric problems themselves.[ref]WHO (2004). Prevention of mental disorders: Effective interventions and policy options. World Health Organization; Geneva, Switzerland. Available <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/en/prevention_of_mental_disorders_sr.pdf">online</a>.[/ref]<sup>,</sup>[ref]Hetherington R, Baistow K, Katz I, Trowell J (2001).

Available <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696847/">online</a>.[/ref] This effect between generations can occur as a result of genetic, biological, psychological and social risk factors.

<strong>Â Adolescence</strong>

Adolescence is typically the stage of life where mental health disorders tend to become more apparent. The risk factors and contributors to wellbeing in childhood apply equally to those in adolescence. In addition, several other contributing factors appear. It is in the years of adolescence that the use of substances including alcohol and drugs first appear.

Substance use is particularly hazardous and harmful for adolescents because individuals are still developing both mentally and physically. Peer pressure, and media influences also become more prominent over these years. Exposure to substance use is not only an important risk factor for other mental health disorders, but also linked to poorer educational outcomes, more risky sexual behaviour and increased exposure to violence and conflict.

<strong>Adulthood</strong>

Experiences and emotional capabilities developed through childhood and adolescence are important factors in the effect that particular events and scenarios in adulthood have on mental health outcomes.

The WHO highlight that critical to wellbeing in adulthood is the allocation and balance between work and leisure time. Exposure to high stress and anxiety is strongly influenced by the share of time working, caring for others, or time spent in an insecure economic environment. Individuals with poor socioeconomic security, and in particular unemployment, are also at higher risk to mental health disorders.

These factors, balanced with the amount of time spent on 'consumption' activities, including leisure time and supportive family and friends, often determine the propensity for poor mental health and wellbeing. Community structures can have a significant positive impact on these outcomesÂ â€” individuals who have poor access to such communities, either through social exclusion, neighbourhood violence/crime, or lack of respite care have a higher risk of mental health disorders.

Physical health also has an important impact on mental wellbeing; an individual's 'physical capital' can influence their sense of esteem and social inclusion. Individuals with chronic illness or disability are at higher risk of poor mental health; this is particularly true for conditions with high rates of stigmatisation, such as HIV/AIDS.

<strong>Older age</strong>

Individuals of older age are of notably high risk of poorer mental health and wellbeing. This typically results from notable changes in life conditions (such as a cease in employment which affects both the feeling of contribution and economic freedom), higher social exclusion, and loneliness. This is particularly true when an older individual begins to lose close family and friends. Bereavement in general is an important predictor of mental health disorders such as depression.

A decline in physical health can have major impacts on life capabilities by affecting an individual's mobility and freedom. Older individuals are also at higher risk of abuse or neglect from carers and in some cases, family members.
<h3>Link between mental health and suicide</h3>
The link between mental health and substance use disorders and suicide is well-documented.[ref]Prince, M., Patel, V., Saxena, S., Maj, M., Maselko, J., Phillips, M. R., &amp; Rahman, A. (2007). No health without mental health.Â <i>The Lancet</i>,Â <i>370</i>(9590), 859-877. Available <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61238-0/fulltext">online</a>.[/ref] It is however true that not all suicides - or suicide attempts - are attributed to underlying mental health or substance use disorders; as shown in the chart below, there is not a direct relationship between mental health prevalence and suicide rates.[ref]Ferrari et al. (2015). The Burden Attributable to Mental and Substance Use Disorders as Risk Factors for Suicide: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Available <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091936#s1">online</a>.[/ref]

We cover suicide statistics more broadly in our full entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide">Suicide</a>, however here we attempt to distil the key findings on the links between mental health and substance use and suicide. Although mental health and substance use disorders is within the top-five <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-total-disease-burden-by-cause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causes of disease burden</a> globally (as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years; DALYs), accounting for approximately 7 percent of the burden, several authors have highlighted that such figures â€” since they do not include suicide DALYs â€” underestimate the true cost of mental health disorders.[ref]Prince, M., Patel, V., Saxena, S., Maj, M., Maselko, J., Phillips, M. R., &amp; Rahman, A. (2007). No health without mental health.Â <i>The Lancet</i>,Â <i>370</i>(9590), 859-877. Available <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61238-0/fulltext">online</a>.[/ref] Providing a more accurate estimate of total mental health burden therefore requires some understanding of the connection between these disorders and suicide.

Meta-analyses of psychological autopsy studies of suicideÂ across high-income countries suggest that up to 90 percent of suicides occur as a result of an underlying mental health or substance use disorder.[ref]Yoshimasu, K., Kiyohara, C., Miyashita, K. et al.

In such cases, understanding the nature of self-harm methods between countries is important; in these countries a high percentage of self-harming behaviours are carried out through more lethal methods such as poisoning (often through pesticides) and self-immolation. This means that in a high number of cases self-harming behaviours can prove fatal, even if there was not a clear intent to die.

A study by Ferrari et al. (2015) attempted to determine the share disease burden from suicide which could be attributed to mental health or substance use disorders.[ref]Ferrari et al. (2015). The Burden Attributable to Mental and Substance Use Disorders as Risk Factors for Suicide: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Available <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091936#s1">online</a>.[/ref] Based on review across a number of meta-analysis studies the authors estimated that 68 percent of suicides across China, Taiwan and India were attributed to mental health and substance use disorders; across other countries this share was approximately 85 percent. In their estimates of total attributable disease burden, the authors concluded that mental health and substance use disorders were responsible for 62 percent of total DALYs lost from suicide.

<h4>Mental health as a risk factor for suicide</h4>
Although the total prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders does not show a direct relationship to suicide rates (as shown in the chart above), there are notable links between specific types of mental health disorders and suicide. In their meta-study of the mental health-suicide relationship, Ferrari et al. (2015) assess the pooled relative risk of suicide across a range of mental health and substance use disorders.[ref]Ferrari et al. (2015). The Burden Attributable to Mental and Substance Use Disorders as Risk Factors for Suicide: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. <em>PLOS ONE</em>. Available <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091936#s1">online</a>.[/ref] This represents the increased risk of suicide for those with a particular mental health or substance use disorder. These results are presented in the table below. As we see, the relative risk is notably higher for some disorders versus others, with high relative risk for those with depression (although with high variability) and schizophrenia.

[table id=86 /]
<h3>Life satisfaction and mental health</h3>
Is the prevalence of mental health disorders reflected in the self-reported life satisfaction or happiness of a given country? Intuitively we may assume that countries with a higher average self-reported life satisfaction would have lower prevalence of mental health disorders. In the chart below we see the relationship between the prevalence of depressive disorders and life satisfaction (measured on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is highest).

Overall we see very little correlation between these two metrics. There is little indication that the more satisfied or 'happy' a given country is, the lower the prevalence of depressive disorders. There are a number of reasons why we would expect there to be little relationship. The first is that, as explained in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#are-happiness-averages-really-meaningful" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happiness and Life Satisfaction</a>, the Cantril ladder measures the <em>aggregate </em>or averageÂ life satisfaction of a given country. Since the typical prevalence of depression across countries is approximately 4-5 percent, we may not expect the reported life satisfaction of these individuals to impact significantly on the overall score of a given country.

Secondly, there is the issue of how accurately self-reported life satisfaction values reflect the actual happiness or life-satisfaction of a given person. It is not improbable that people may lie or exaggerate how satisfied they are with their life. Overall, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#can-happiness-really-be-measured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we describe</a> in our separate entry, studies have found good correlation between self-reported life satisfaction and particular signals of happiness (such as smiling frequency, smiling with the eyes, sleep quality, nuances in word choice and language, sociability etc.) as well as activity in parts of the brain associated with pleasure and happiness. Nonetheless, because on average, self-reported and signs of happiness/satisfaction correlate well does not necessitate that this is the cases in more specific demographics, such as those with depression or other mental health disorders.

<h2>Data Quality, Definitions and Measurement</h2>
<h3>Definitions of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders</h3>
<h4>Depressive disorders</h4>
Depressive disorders occur with varying severity. The WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">define this set of disorders</a> ranging from mild to moderate to severe. The IHME adopt such definitions by disaggregating to mild, persistent depression (dysthymia) and major depressive disorder (severe).

All forms of depressive disorder experience some of the following symptoms:
<ul>
 	<li>(a) reduced concentration and attention;</li>
 	<li>(b) reduced self-esteem and self-confidence;</li>
 	<li>(c) ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode);</li>
 	<li>(d) bleak and pessimistic views of the future;</li>
 	<li>(e) ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide;</li>
 	<li>(f) disturbed sleep</li>
 	<li>(g) diminished appetite.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mild persistent depression (dysthymia)</strong> tends to have the following diagnostic guidelines:
<blockquote>"Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described on page 119 (for F32.-) should usually be present for a definite diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a mild depressive episode is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities, but will probably not cease to function completely."</blockquote>
<strong>Severe depressive disorder</strong> tends to have the following diagnostic guidelines:
<blockquote>"In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked feature. Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode. During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent."</blockquote>
<h4>Anxiety disorders</h4>
Anxiety disorders arise in a number of forms including phobic, social, obsessive compulsive (OCD), post-traumatic disorder (PTSD), or generalized anxiety disorders.

The symptoms and diagnostic criteria for each subset of anxiety disorders are unique. However, collectively theÂ WHO'sÂ International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) note frequent symptoms of:
<blockquote>"(a) apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling "on edge", difficulty in concentrating, etc.);

(b) motor tension (restless fidgeting, tension headaches, trembling, inability to relax);

(c) autonomic overactivity (lightheadedness, sweating, tachycardia or tachypnoea, epigastric discomfort, dizziness, dry mouth, etc.)."</blockquote>
<h4>Bipolar disorder</h4>
Bipolar disorder (also termed bipolar affective disorder) is defined by the WHO'sÂ International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as follows:
<blockquote>"This disorder is characterized by repeated (i.e. at least two) episodes in which the patient's mood and activity levels are significantly disturbed, this disturbance consisting on some occasions of an elevation of mood and increased energy and activity (mania or hypomania), and on others of a lowering of mood and decreased energy and activity (depression). Characteristically, recovery is usually complete between episodes, and the incidence in the two sexes is more nearly equal than in other mood disorders. As patients who suffer only from repeated episodes of mania are comparatively rare, and resemble (in their family history, premorbid personality, age of onset, and long-term prognosis) those who also have at least occasional episodes of depression, such patients are classified as bipolar."</blockquote>
<h4>Definition of eating disorders</h4>
Eating disorders are differentiated by IHME and the WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) by two clear-cut syndromes: anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
<strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong>
Anorexia nervosa is a disorder exemplified by deliberate weight loss, and associated with undernutrition of varying severity.

For a definite diagnosis, the ICD note that all the following are required:

(a) Body weight is maintained at least 15% below that expected (either lost or never achieved), or Quetelet's body-mass index4 is 17.5 or less. 4 Quetelet's body-mass index = weight (kg) to be used for age 16 or more - 139 - Prepubertal patients may show failure to make the expected weight gain during the period of growth;

(b) The weight loss is self-induced by avoidance of "fattening foods". One or more of the following may also be present: self-induced vomiting; self-induced purging; excessive exercise; use of appetite suppressants and/or diuretics;

(c) There is body-image distortion in the form of a specific psychopathology whereby a dread of fatness persists as an intrusive, overvalued idea and the patient imposes a low weight threshold on himself or herself;

(d) A widespread endocrine disorder involving the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis is manifest in women as amenorrhoea and in men as a loss of sexual interest and potency. (An apparent exception is the persistence of vaginal bleeds in anorexic women who are receiving replacement hormonal therapy, most commonly taken as a contraceptive pill.) There may also be elevated levels of growth hormone, raised levels of cortisol, changes in the peripheral metabolism of the thyroid hormone, and abnormalities of insulin secretion;

(e) If onset is prepubertal, the sequence of pubertal events is delayed or even arrested (growth ceases; in girls the breasts do not develop and there is a primary amenorrhoea; in boys the genitals remain juvenile). With recovery, puberty is often completed normally, but the menarche is late.

<strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong>
Bulimia nervosa is an illness defined by repeated behaviours of overeating, preoccupation with control of body weight, and the adoption of extreme measures to mitigate the impacts of overeating.

For a definite diagnosis, the ICD note that all the following are required:

(a) There is a persistent preoccupation with eating, and an irresistible craving for food; the patient succumbs to episodes of overeating in which large amounts of food are consumed in short periods of time.

(b) The patient attempts to counteract the "fattening" effects of food by one or more of the following: self-induced vomiting; purgative abuse, alternating periods of starvation; use of drugs such as appetite suppressants, thyroid preparations or diuretics. When bulimia occurs in diabetic patients they may choose to neglect their insulin treatment.

(c) The psychopathology consists of a morbid dread of fatness and the patient sets herself or himself a sharply defined weight threshold, well below the premorbid weight that constitutes the optimum or healthy weight in the opinion of the physician. There is often, but not always, a history of an earlier episode of anorexia nervosa, the interval between the two disorders ranging from a few months to several years. This earlier episode may have been fully expressed, or may have assumed a minor cryptic form with a moderate loss of weight and/or a transient phase of amenorrhoea.
<h4>Schizophrenia disorders</h4>
Schizophrenia is defined by the IHME <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on the definition</a> within the WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as:

The normal requirement for a diagnosis of schizophrenia is that a minimum of one very clear symptom (and usually two or more if less clear-cut) belonging to any one of the groups listed as (a) to (d) below, or symptoms from at least two of the groups referred to as (e) to (h), should have been clearly present for most of the time during a period of 1 month or more:
<ul>
 	<li>(a) thought echo, thought insertion or withdrawal, and thought broadcasting;</li>
 	<li>(b) delusions of control, influence, or passivity, clearly referred to body or limb movements or specific thoughts, actions, or sensations; delusional perception;</li>
 	<li>(c) hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary on the patient's behaviour, or discussing the patient among themselves, or other types of hallucinatory voices coming from some part of the body;</li>
 	<li>(d) persistent delusions of other kinds that are culturally inappropriate and completely impossible, such as religious or political identity, or superhuman powers and - 79 - abilities (e.g. being able to control the weather, or being in communication with aliens from another world);</li>
 	<li>(e) persistent hallucinations in any modality, when accompanied either by fleeting or half-formed delusions without clear affective content, or by persistent over-valued ideas, or when occurring every day for weeks or months on end;</li>
 	<li>(f) breaks or interpolations in the train of thought, resulting in incoherence or irrelevant speech, or neologisms;</li>
 	<li>(g) catatonic behaviour, such as excitement, posturing, or waxy flexibility, negativism, mutism, and stupor;</li>
 	<li>(h) "negative" symptoms such as marked apathy, paucity of speech, and blunting or incongruity of emotional responses, usually resulting in social withdrawal and lowering of social performance; it must be clear that these are not due to depression or to neuroleptic medication;</li>
 	<li>(i) a significant and consistent change in the overall quality of some aspects of personal behaviour, manifest as loss of interest, aimlessness, idleness, a self-absorbed attitude, and social withdrawal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Autistic spectrum disorders</h4>
Autistic disorders lie on a spectrum, which differ in terms of severity and characteristic behaviours. The term 'autistic spectrum disorder' includes those with autism (both childhood and atypical), and Asperger Syndrome or other autistic spectrum disorders.

<strong>Childhood autism</strong>
The ICD provide the following definition and diagnostic criteria of childhood autism:
"A pervasive developmental disorder defined by the presence of abnormal and/or impaired development that is manifest before the age of 3 years, and by the characteristic type of abnormal functioning in all three areas of social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviour."

"Usually there is no prior period of unequivocally normal development but, if there is, abnormalities become apparent before the age of 3 years. There are always qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction. These take the form of an inadequate appreciation of socio-emotional cues, as shown by a lack of responses to other people's emotions and/or a lack of modulation of behaviour according to social context; poor use of social signals and a weak integration of social, emotional, and communicative behaviours; and, especially, a lack of socio-emotional reciprocity.

"The condition is also characterized by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. These take the form of a tendency to impose rigidity and routine on a wide range of aspects of day-to day functioning; this usually applies to novel activities as well as to familiar habits and play patterns."

<strong>Atypical autism</strong>
'Atypical autism' differs from childhood autism either based on the age of onset, or the number of diagnostic criteria which are fulfilled. Those with atypical autism develop the condition after the age of 3 and/or they do not demonstrate behaviours in one or two of the three areas which typically diagnose autism (i.e. reciprocal social interactions, communication, and restrictive, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour).

<strong>Asperger Syndrome</strong>
Asperger Syndrome is classified as part of the spectrum of autistic disorders, but is differentiated from childhood or atypical autism. The ICD provide the following definition and diagnostic criteria for Asperger Syndrome:
"A disorder of uncertain nosological validity, characterized by the same kind of qualitative abnormalities of reciprocal social interaction that typify autism, together with a restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. The disorder differs from autism primarily in that there is no general delay or retardation in language or in cognitive development."

"Diagnosis is based on the combination of a lack of any clinically significant general delay in language or cognitive development plus, as with autism, the presence of qualitative deficiencies in reciprocal social interaction and restricted, repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. There may or may not be problems in communication similar to those associated with autism, but significant language retardation would rule out the diagnosis."
<h4>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</h4>
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is termed 'hyperkinetic disorders' by the ICD. It uses the following definition and diagnostic criteria:
"this group of disorders is characterized by: early onset; a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behaviour with marked inattention and lack of persistent task involvement; and pervasiveness over situations and persistence over time of these behavioural characteristics.

"Hyperkinetic disorders always arise early in development (usually in the first 5 years of life). Their chief characteristics are lack of persistence in activities that require cognitive involvement, and a tendency to move from one activity to another without completing any one, together with disorganized, ill-regulated, and excessive activity. These problems usually persist through school years and even into adult life, but many affected individuals show a gradual improvement in activity and attention."
<h4>Disorders of psychological or intellectual development</h4>
This category is broad and incorporates a number of disorders which can affect development in terms of speech, language, motor condition, and visuo-spatial skills.

The ICD categorise this group of disorders as having the following common traits:
"(a) an onset that is invariably during infancy or childhood;
(b) an impairment or delay in the development of functions that are strongly related to biological maturation of the central nervous system; and
(c) a steady course that does not involve the remissions and relapses that tend to be characteristic of many mental disorders."

"In most cases, the functions affected include language, visuo-spatial skills and/or motor coordination. It is characteristic for the impairments to lessen progressively as children grow older (although milder deficits often remain in adult life)."
<h3>Data availability on mental health</h3>
The majority of data presented in this entry is based on estimates from the IHME's <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool">Global Burden of Disease</a> (GBD). This is currently one of the only sources which produces global level estimates across most countries on the prevalence and disease burden of mental health and substance use disorders.

Nonetheless, the GBD acknowledges the clear data gaps which exist on mental health prevalence across the world. Despite being the 5th largest disease burden at a global level (and with within the top three across many countries), detailed data is often lacking. This is particularly true of lower-income countries. The Global Burden of Disease note that the range of epidemiological studies they draw upon for global and national estimates are unequally distributed across disorders, age groups, countries and epidemiological parameters.[ref]Whiteford, H., Ferrari, A., &amp; Degenhardt, L. (2016). Global burden of disease studies: implications for mental and substance use disorders.Â <i>Health Affairs</i>,Â <i>35</i>(6), 1114-1120. Available <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0082">online</a>.[/ref] Utilising these studies to provide full coverage of these disorders is challenging.

To overcome these methodological challenges the authors note:
<blockquote>To deal with this issue and be able to include data derived using various study methodologies and designs, GBD 2013 makes use of DisMod-MR, version 2.0, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. The software makes it possible to pool all of the epidemiological data available for a given disorder into a weighted average, while simultaneously adjusting for known sources of variability in estimates reported across studies. If raw data are not available for a given country, the software produces an imputed estimate for each epidemiological parameter based on data available from surrounding countries. This allowed GBD to include estimates for 188 countries.</blockquote>
