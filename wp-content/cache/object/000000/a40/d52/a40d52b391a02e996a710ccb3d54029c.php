We worked on a series of updates and added new entries to our web publication. Here are the links to 7 of our latest additions:
<ul>
 	<li>We have two completely new meta entries: One for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/">health</a> and for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education">education</a>. They both present the most important aspect on these topics and give a first overview so that you can then go and study and read about the particular aspects in more depth in the specific entries.</li>
 	<li>On the same topics we did quite a lot of work to present the empirical research on how these public goods are financed. You find these in the entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">financing health</a> and on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education">financing education</a>.</li>
 	<li>We have also updated and added a series of specific entries: Three that I think are particularly interesting are the entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trust">trust</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/">literacy</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade">international trade</a>.</li>
</ul>
