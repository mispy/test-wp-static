The contribution of each of these sources has changed significantly through time, and still shows large differences by region. In the chart below we see the absolute and relative contribution of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by source, differentiated between gas, liquid (i.e. oil), solid (coal and biomass), flaring, and cement production.

At a global level we see that early industrialisation was dominated by the use of solid fuelâ€”this is best observed by switching to the 'relative' view in the chart. Coal-fired power at an industrial-scale was the first to emerge in Europe and North America during the 1700s. It wasnâ€™t until the late 1800s that we begin to see a growth in emissions from oil and gas production. Another century passed before emissions from flaring and cement production began. In the present day, solid and liquid fuel dominate, although contributions from gas production are also notable. Cement and flaring at the global level remain comparably small.

You can also view these trends across global regions in the chart below, by clicking on 'change region'. The trends vary significantly by region. Overall patterns across Europe and North America are similar: early industrialisation began through solid fuel consumption, however, through time this energy mix has diversified. Today, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are spread fairly equally between coal, oil and gas. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbeanâ€™s emissions have historically been and remain a product of liquid fuelâ€”even in the early stages of development coal consumption was small.[ref]Zilio, M., &amp; Recalde, M.
