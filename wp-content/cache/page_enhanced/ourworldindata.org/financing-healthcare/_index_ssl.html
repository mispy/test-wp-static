				<p>Health is a fundamental driver of our overall quality of life. In this entry we focus on health<em>care</em> – one of the most important inputs to produce health.

<p>The impact that scientific developments had on healthcare expenditure is epitomized in the U.S. experience: in recent decades, as treatment possibilities expanded rapidly, expenditure on healthcare increased (private and public, both per capita and as a share of gross domestic product); and this occurred without major changes in insurance coverage. This had two important consequences: (i) the U.S. currently spends more government money per person on healthcare than many countries that fund universal programs, and (ii) spending is so concentrated that the top 1% of spenders account for more than 20% of total healthcare expenditure.<a id='ref-4' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-4'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Estimates from OECD &#8211; Health Expenditure and Financing Dataset; and Schoenman, Julie A. &#8220;The concentration of health care spending.&#8221; NIHCM Foundation Data Brief, National Institute of Health Care Management, Washington, DC (2012).'>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Global expenditure on healthcare as a share of world income has been increasing, steadily but slowly over the course of the last couple of decades. In the background, however, there has been substantial cross-country heterogeneity, both in levels and trends. Regionally, high-income countries spend – and have been spending – a much larger share of their income on healthcare than low-income countries (about twice as much). Moreover, in contrast to high-income countries, in low and middle-income countries the public share of healthcare funding is much lower – although it has been catching up – and the role of out-of-pocket expenditures is much higher (above 50% of total expenditure in many countries).<a id='ref-5' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-5'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Estimates from WHO – Global Health Expenditure Database from the World Health Organization'>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Healthcare financing in developing countries in the 21st century has been largely shaped by the flow of resources channeled through development assistance. These flows – which saw a steep increase after the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals – account for around 0.7% of the resources spent by high-income countries on healthcare. Although this may seem small in proportion to the national commitments of rich countries, for low-income countries at the receiving end of the transfers, these resources are substantial; in Sub-Saharan Africa they finance more than 25% of total expenditure on healthcare.<a id='ref-6' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-6'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Estimates from Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

<p>Nowadays healthcare is commonly considered a ‘merit good’ – a commodity which is judged that an individual or society should have on the basis of need rather than ability and willingness to pay. This view, mainly grounded on the recognised positive externalities of healthcare consumption, is perhaps most visibly materialized in the fact that access to healthcare is currently a constitutional right in many countries.<a id='ref-8' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-8'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='That healthcare should be considered a human right is nevertheless still subject of much debate. For an academic discussion of the principle of health care as a human right, see Smith, Richard, et al. &#8220;Shared ethical principles for everybody in health care: a working draft from the Tavistock Group.&#8221; British Medical Journal 318.7178 (1999): 248.'>8</sup></a> However, a couple of centuries ago the situation was very different. In fact, during the Middle Ages health was considered a matter of destiny across most of Western Europe; it was only afterwards, under the influence of Mercantilism and the Enlightenment, that this view started changing and public authorities increased their ambitions concerning the promotion of public health.<a id='ref-9' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-9'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='For instance, concrete cases of successful interventions aimed at curbing the spread of the plague are recorded in Marseille and Provence 1720–1722.'>9</sup></a> Sundin and Willner (2007) say that “[g]enerally, before the era of the Enlightenment, it was thought that health was God’s gift and disease and death was His punishment for the sins of an individual, the congregation, the whole nation or its rulers. Hence, to live a decent life in accordance with His will and repenting one’s sins were considered the most effective preventive measures against illnesses&#8221;.<a id='ref-10' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-10'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Sundin, Jan, and Sam Willner.

<p>To our knowledge, the earliest data on financing of healthcare dates back to the late 19th century – this is when many European countries began officially establishing healthcare systems through legislative acts. The following visualization presents public expenditure on healthcare as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP henceforth) for a selection of high-income countries for the period 1880-1994 using data from Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000)<a id='ref-11' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-11'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Tanzi, Vito, and Ludger Schuknecht.

We&#8217;ve included eight countries for reference, but you can add other countries to the same chart by clicking on the corresponding option. As it can be appreciated, public expenditure on healthcare in all of these countries followed roughly similar paths; and this is despite early differences in their healthcare regimes (for a detailed account of the institutional evolution of healthcare regimes in these countries see the <a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Social-Policy/Health/Organisational-Structure/DR4-04-ev-HC-ref.html">report prepared by CESifo DICE</a>).</p>

<p>The steeper increase in public expenditure on healthcare observed in European countries after the Second World War is largely due to the fact that medicine had major breakthroughs during the second half of the 20th century – beginning, notably, with the discovery and use of penicillin and other antibiotics. Before these scientific developments took place, the main component of healthcare was not treatment but income insurance, an insurance paying benefits to those who were unable to work due to poor health. In fact public health insurance for workers was already substantial in a number of European countries before the Second World War. The following visualization presents public health insurance coverage as percent of labour force for a number of European countries (missing observations in this graph reflect lack of public insurance programs for the corresponding year/country). Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000) – the source for the data in this figure – note that by 1929 all the eleven European countries shown in this visualization had at least voluntary insurance schemes; and that by 1935 half their labor force was covered by health insurance.</p>

<p>Having introduced universal access to healthcare in 1948 through the National Health Service, the United Kingdom is a particularly interesting instance to study in detail.<a id='ref-13' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-13'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='The National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948 with the aim of providing health services to all UK citizens, financed by general taxation and free at the point of use.'>13</sup></a> The following visualization shows that the costs of this universal-access system grew more in the first decade of the 21st century, than they did in the first two decades immediately after its inception.</p>

<p>The U.S. is an interesting case to study historical changes in healthcare expenditure. In contrast to the UK, discussed above, the US does not have a universal public health insurance, and its healthcare system has been historically financed through a large share of private funds. The following visualisation presents public and private spending in healthcare in the U.S. as a percent of GDP (clicking on the &#8216;expanded&#8217; option switches from absolute expenditure as a percent of GDP, to shares of expenditure by source). It shows that both public and private expenditure went up substantially in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. And this increase was such that public resources became an increasingly important source to finance healthcare (despite the fact that public resources always accounted for less than half of total spending on healthcare). The continued increase in public expenditure on healthcare in the U.S. means that today it actually spends more government money per person on healthcare than many countries that fund universal programs. Specifically in comparison to the U.K., by 1995 the U.S. already spent more public resources (as a percent of GDP) than the British NHS.</p>

<p>The lion&#8217;s share of the above-mentioned historical increase in healthcare expenditure in the U.S. took place without an underlying increase in the share of people who were covered by health insurance. The following visualization supports this; it presents a plot of coverage rates by type of plan (particular care should be taken when reading this graph, since insurance plans are not mutually exclusive; this means that those covered by &#8216;private&#8217; and &#8216;government&#8217; plans add up to more than those covered by &#8216;any plan&#8217;). As it can be seen, total health insurance coverage remained virtually constant at around 85% for decades, while private and public healthcare expenditure increased continuously over the same period. Interestingly, this data also shows an apparent change in coverage trends after 2012, when the ‘Affordable Care Act’ started kicking in. The <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/188045/uninsured-rate-fourth-quarter-2015.aspx?utm_source=genericbutton&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=sharing">most recent Gallup estimates</a> (fourth quarter of 2015) place total coverage at 88.1%.</p>

<p>The fact that insurance coverage remained stable while healthcare spending was increasing rapidly due to major improvements in treatment possibilities during the 20th century, implied that healthcare expenditure in the U.S. grew highly concentrated. The following graph, produced by the National Institute for Health Care Management (NIHCM), shows the cumulative distribution of healthcare spending in the U.S., using data on personal expenditures during the year 2009, across the entire &#8216;non-institutionalized civilian population&#8217;.</p>
<p>The source of the data for this visualization is the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey – a nationally representative longitudinal survey that collects information on healthcare utilization and expenditure, health insurance, and health status, as well sociodemographic and economic characteristics for civilian non-institutionalized population. According to the source, the data refers to &#8216;non-institutionalized civilian population&#8217;, in the sense that it excludes care provided to residents of institutions, such as long-term care facilities and penitentiaries, as well as care for military and other non-civilian members of the population. The data corresponds to &#8216;personal healthcare services&#8217;, in the sense that they exclude administrative costs, research, capital investments and many other public and private programs such as school health and worksite wellness.</p>
<p>This graph should be read similarly to a Lorenz curve: the fact that the cumulative distribution of spending bends sharply away from the 45% degree line is a measure of high inequality (this is the intuition of the Gini coefficient that we discuss in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">income inequality</a> data entry). As it can be seen, the top 5% of spenders account for almost half of spending, and the top 1% account for more than 20%. While some concentration in expenditure is to be expected when looking at the distribution across the entire population – because it is in the nature of healthcare that some individuals, particularly those older and with complicated health conditions, will require large expenditure –, these figures seem remarkably large. They suggest important inequality in access, over and above inequality in need. Indeed, the publisher of the graph notes that a report from the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission shows that personal spending for individuals covered by Medicaid is somewhat less concentrated than for the population as a whole.<a id='ref-14' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-14'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Medicare Payment Assessment Commission.

<h4 id="how-quickly-can-insurance-coverage-expand"> <a class="deep-link" href="#how-quickly-can-insurance-coverage-expand"># </a> How quickly can insurance coverage expand?</h4>
<p>We have already pointed out that European countries pioneered the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage in the first half of the twentieth century. The following visualization, from the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2014-human-development-report.html">Human Development Report (2014)</a>, places the achievements of these countries in perspective. Specifically, the following graph plots healthcare protection coverage for a selection of countries during the period 1920-2010. As we can see, France, Austria and Germany increased healthcare coverage in the years 1920-1960, while Spain, Portugal and Greece did it later, in the years 1960-1980. Interestingly, however, this graph also shows some notable examples of countries that expanded healthcare coverage much later, but much more quickly. In particular, China, Rwanda and Vietnam built health protection systems in the 21st century, almost from scratch, achieving near universal coverage in only a decade. These examples show that healthcare protection can be expanded very quickly, and not only at low baseline levels of coverage.</p>

<p>In the last two decades total aggregate global expenditure on healthcare has been relatively stable, albeit with a slow steady increase. The following visualization uses data from the World Health Organisation (published in the World Development Indicators) to show this. Total healthcare spending as a percent of GDP has seen an overall increase of roughly 1.5 perceptual points over the last two decades, with a relatively constant share of resources coming from the public sector.</p>

<p>Global trends in healthcare expenditure mask a great deal of heterogeneity. The following map shows how total expenditure on healthcare has changed across the world. Clicking on the &#8216;chart&#8217; tab in this visualization allows you to plot country-specific series. Although trends are not very pronounced for most countries, there are clear exceptions (e.g. Ecuador). And there are strong differences in levels: countries with higher GDP per capita exhibit substantially higher expenditure on healthcare as a share of their income. This salient feature is explored in more detail below under <em>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</em>.</p>

<p>World-wide cross-country data shows that, while the public share of resources used to finance healthcare has been stable in the aggregate, there is substantial underlying heterogeneity. The first visualization below presents public spending on healthcare as a share of total healthcare spending by country (again, with our usual &#8216;chart&#8217; and &#8216;map&#8217; views) – it shows large differences even among relatively homogeneous industrialized market economies. The second visualization presents the same variable (public spending on healthcare as a share of total healthcare) but aggregating countries by income levels (World Bank classification) – this shows that there have been substantial underlying shifts across regions. More specifically, in countries in the low-income and upper-middle-income brackets, there has been a marked increase in the share of public resources used to finance healthcare; in high-income countries there is no clear trend.</p>

<p>The Millennium Development Goals have been associated with major increases in global health financing flows, particularly for the health focus areas explicitly targeted (fight against child mortality, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis). An important part of these financing flows occur under the label of development assistance. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) defines development assistance for health as all financial and in-kind contributions provided by global health channels to improve health in developing countries (including grants, as well as concessionary loans, provided with no interest or at a rate significantly lower than the going market rate).</p>
<p>The IHME reports that since the formation of the Millennium Development Goals, $227.9 billion in development assistance has targeted these health focus areas. These flows account for around 0.7% of the resources spent by high-income countries on healthcare. Although this may seem small in proportion to the national commitments of rich countries, for low-income countries at the receiving end of the transfers, these resources are substantial; in sub-Saharan Africa they finance more than 25% of total expenditure on healthcare<a id='ref-19' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-19'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='In middle-income countries, also receiving some of such development assistance funds, the weight is much lower – external funding accounts for less than 5% of spending in these countries.'>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The report <em>Financing Global Health 2014</em>, produced by the IHME, provides a detailed account of this source of funding for healthcare, and how it has changed over the last two decades. The data can be accessed from IHME&#8217;s website, where there are also some excellent interactive visualizations. The chart below shows the evolution of development assistance for health by source, over the last fifteen years. As it can be seen, these funds increased sharply in the period 2000-2010, but have plateaued since. Considering that this source of funding has a larger weight in those countries with the lowest income, the recent change in trend is particularly problematic for the poorest.</p>

<p>In many countries an important part of the private funding for healthcare takes the form of &#8216;out-of-pocket&#8217; spending. This refers to direct outlays made by households, including gratuities and in-kind payments, to healthcare providers. The following visualization presents out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare by country (as percent of total healthcare expenditure). As it can be seen, in high-income countries these outlays tend to account for only a small fraction of expenditure on healthcare (e.g. France, where the share was always below 8% in the entire series 1995-2013); while in low-income countries, they account for the majority of funding (e.g. Afghanistan, where the share of out-of-pocket expenditure reached 87.7% in 2002). Many countries have followed a clear path in the direction of reducing this type of expenditures (particularly in the developing world), yet some countries have moved in the opposite direction (Russia is a notable case in point, with a threefold increase in the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in the last decade).</p>

<p>In countries where healthcare is principally financed through public funds, out-of-pocket spending is typically low; this is natural, since in these countries there is essentially universal coverage through public insurance (e.g. Cuba, UK, Sweden, France). And by the same logic, out-of-pocket spending is also low in countries where healthcare is largely financed through private funds in the form of private voluntary insurance (e.g. US). It is in countries with low public healthcare spending and low private voluntary insurance that out-of-pocket expenditure is high (e.g. India, Afghanistan, Sudan). This is shown in the following visualization from Jamison et al (2013);<a id='ref-22' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-22'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Jamison, Dean T., et al. &#8220;Global health 2035: a world converging within a generation.&#8221; The Lancet 382.9908 (2013): 1898-1955'>22</sup></a> it illustrates how much progress different countries have made in providing &#8216;prepaid care&#8217; and the extent to which they use public funds (compulsory social insurance or funding from general government revenue) or private voluntary insurance. As it can be seen, there are no countries near the top-left corner while there are several in the bottom-right. The message seems to be that achieving universal coverage requires government or publicly mandated finance – arguably a justification for some of the reforms recently implemented by the Affordable Care Act in the US (see discussion immediately below).</p>

<p>In June 2012 the US introduced the Affordable Care Act (ACA) – a legal reform aiming to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of healthcare. In other sections in this entry we provide evidence of some of the underlying issues that motivated a reform to improve healthcare coverage in the US.<a id='ref-24' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-24'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='See  White, C. (2010). The health care reform legislation: an overview.

Here we want to focus on whether insurance coverage indeed improved after the introduction of the ACA. The following visualization shows the percentage of individuals in the US without health insurance for the period 1963-2015. As we can see there are two marked changes in the trends separated by a long period of remarkable stability: there is a sharp drop in the number of uninsured in 1965 with the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, then relatively little change for decades, and then another sharp drop in 2012 with the introduction of the ACA. Disaggregated data shows that those states that decided to expand their Medicaid programs saw larger reductions in their uninsured rates from 2013 to 2015, especially when those states had large uninsured populations to start with (see <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2533698">Obama (2016)</a>.<a id='ref-25' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-25'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Obama, B.

While strictly speaking this is only descriptive evidence – we cannot know what would have happened to the trends without the introduction of the ACA –, it seems reasonable to assume that the observed improvements in healthcare coverage are indeed a consequence of the ACA.</p>

<p>At a cross-country level, the strongest predictor of healthcare spending is national income (you can find more about measures of national income in our <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a>). The following visualization presents evidence of this relationship. The correlation is striking: countries with a higher per capita income are much more likely to spend a larger share of their income on healthcare. In a seminal paper, Newhouse (1977)<a id='ref-26' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-26'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Newhouse, J.P. (1977), “Medical care expenditure: a cross-national survey”, Journal of Human Resources 12:115–125.'>26</sup></a> showed that aggregate income explains almost all of the variance in the level of healthcare expenditure (specifically, Newhouse (1977) showed that among a group of 13 developed countries, GDP per capita explained 92 percent of the variance in per capita health expenditure). Other studies have confirmed that this strong positive relationship remains after accounting for additional factors, such as country-specific demographic characteristics.<a id='ref-27' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-27'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='Interestingly, there are important institutional variables that are also significantly correlated with healthcare expenditure after controlling for income. For example, the use of primary care “gatekeepers” seems to result in lower health expenditure. And lower levels of health expenditure also appear to occur in systems where the patient first pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement, compared to other systems.

<p>As we discussed in the previous section on international flows of global health financing, in some countries an important part of the income that is available to finance healthcare comes from international development assistance.

Interestingly, this &#8216;crowding-out&#8217; effect depends on the channel: the correlation between international health aid to non-governmental organizations and government health funding is negative.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#how-large-is-domestic-public-expenditure-in-developing-countries-after-removing-funds-from-development-assistance">previous section</a> we pointed out that healthcare spending from autonomous sources has increased substantially in many low and middle-income countries over the last couple of decades. The following chart shows a recent snapshot of the cross-country correlation between tax revenue and healthcare spending in these countries. We can see that developing countries with higher tax revenues tend to spend more on healthcare. In fact, in a recent paper, Reeves et al.

Exploring the relationship between health outcomes and different types of taxation, Reeves et al.

<p>In most countries with market economies, the market for healthcare is only one of many markets competing for the same resources; because of this the prices for healthcare services are affected by productivity changes in other markets. Economic theory suggests that, if the productivity of the healthcare industry increases slower than that of other industries (a probable scenario given that healthcare provision is particularly labour-intensive), then prices in the healthcare sector are likely to grow faster than inflation, and expenditure as a share of income is thus likely to grow (this argument is known as <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21563714">Baumol’s ‘cost disease’</a>). The following graph from Culyer and Newhouse (2000) shows that in the U.S., over the course of the 20th century the growth in the consumer price index for all goods and services (CPI) was lower than the growth in the medical consumer price index (MCPI).

<p>Healthcare is one of the most important inputs to produce health; and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> is one of the key measures of a population&#8217;s health. The following visualization shows the relationship between life expectancy at birth and healthcare expenditure per capita. This chart shows the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available (1995 and 2014 respectively). The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. As it can be seen, countries with higher expenditure on healthcare per person tend to have a higher life expectancy.And looking at the change over time, we see that as countries spend more money on health, life expectancy of the population increases.</p>
<p>Notice that the relationship in this chart seems to follow a pattern of &#8216;diminishing returns&#8217;: the increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in healthcare expenditure decreases as expenditure increases. This means the proportional highest gains are achieved in countries with low baseline levels of spending. This pattern is similar to that observed <a href="/life-expectancy/#life-expectancy-and-gdp">between life expectancy and per capita income</a>.</p>
<p>The countries are color-coded by world region, as per the inserted legends. Many of the green countries (Sub-Saharan Africa) achieved remarkable progress over the last 2 decades: health spending often increased substantially and life expectancy in many African countries increased by more than 10 years. The most extreme case is Rwanda, where life expectancy has increased from 32 to 64 years since 1995 (which was one year after the Rwandan genocide). The graph also shows that the African countries that suffered the most under the HIV/AIDS epidemic – Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa – experienced a decline of life expectancy from which they have not yet recovered.</p>
<p>The two most populous countries of the world – India and China – are emphasized by larger arrows. It is interesting to see that in 1995 China achieved good health outcomes at comparatively low levels of health spending.</p>
<p>The association between health spending and increasing life expectancy also holds for rich countries in Europe, Asia, and North America in the upper right corner of the chart. The US is an outlier that achieves only a comparatively short life expectancy considering the fact that the country has by far the highest health expenditure of any country in the world (we will get back to this aspect further below).</p>

<h4 id="how-strong-is-the-link-between-healthcare-expenditure-and-child-mortality"> <a class="deep-link" href="#how-strong-is-the-link-between-healthcare-expenditure-and-child-mortality"># </a>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and child mortality?</h4>
<p>The following visualization presents the relationship between <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> – measured as the share of children dying before their fifth birthday – and healthcare expenditure per capita. Global data on health expenditure per capita is available since 1995 and in this chart we show the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available. The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. We can see that child mortality is declining as more money is spent on health.</p>
<p>Focusing on change over time we can see a particularly striking fact: while there is huge inequality in levels – child mortality in the best-performing countries is almost 100-times lower than in the worst – inequality in trends is surprisingly stable. Specifically, if you look at the paths over time it is surprising how little heterogeneity there is between very different countries in the world. No matter whether it is a rich country in Europe or a much poorer country in Africa, the proportional decline in child mortality associated with a proportional increase in health expenditure is remarkably similar.</p>
<p>The visualization also shows the very high global inequality in health spending per capita that is still prevalent today. In the Central African Republic only 25 international-$ are spent per capita while on the other end of the distribution, in the US, 9,403 international-$ are spent. The ratio between the two countries is 376; on average Americans spent more on health per day than a person in the Central African Republic spends in an entire year. This is a very large gap, considering that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/#international-gdp-comparisons-market-vs-ppp-exchange-rates">International-$</a> are adjusted for price differences between countries – if price differences were not taken into account, and the spending would have been expressed in US-$ by simply using the exchange rate between the different currencies, the difference would be even larger.</p>
<p>You can also explore this relationship between healthcare spending and child mortality in an <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-health-expenditure">interactive visualization</a>.</p>
<p>The results here are similar to the strong correlation between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy that we noted in the previous section.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned cross-sectional relationships cannot be interpreted causally because countries differs in a number of ways that simultaneously affect health outcomes and health expenditure. Income is one of them. But we can get a step closer by concentrating on countries with similar income per capita, and looking at changes across time for each country, which eliminates the potential confounding effect of country-specific time-invariant factors.</p>
<p>The following graph visualizes the relationship between life expectancy and health expenditure, for a number of OECD countries across the period 1970-2014. Two points are worth mentioning. Firstly, all countries in this graph have followed an upward trajectory (life expectancy increased as health expenditure increased), but the U.S. stands out as an exception following a much flatter trajectory; gains in life expectancy from additional health spending in the U.S. were much smaller than in the other high-income countries, particularly since the mid-1980s. And secondly, the gains for all countries (except for the U.S.) were not diminishing, as in the previous graph. This suggests that there are many other factors affecting life expectancy, that are not determined by healthcare spending. Indeed, as we have pointed out before, healthcare is just one of many inputs to produce health.</p>

<p>The ever-elusive question of causality is not fully addressed in the analysis above (the issue of time varying unobservables and potential simultaneity remains), but the presented visualizations are nevertheless indicative of a clear and strong relationship; the health returns to healthcare investment suggested by the figures above are substantial, particularly for low-income countries.

<p>The main source of data on international healthcare expenditure is the World Health Organisation (WHO), more specifically the <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database">global health expenditure database</a>. This is the same data published by the World Bank (World Development Indicators) and <a href="https://www.gapminder.org">Gapminder</a>. It is also the source of the health expenditure tables in the World Health Statistics Report and the WHO Global Health Observatory; and it is used as an input to the Development Assistance for Health Database from the IHME.<a id='ref-39' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-39'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='IHME collects budget, revenue, and expenditure data for 39 global health channels in order to estimate flows of development assistance for health.

<p>WHO data is produced mainly from national reports, but it also relies on reports from international organizations. The health statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), specifically the <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA">Health Expenditure and Financing Dataset</a>, are one of the inputs used by the WHO. Other important inputs from international organizations are the EUROSTAT database and the United Nations national accounts statistics. Since the WHO relies on a number of sources, its estimates do not always coincide with e.g. national statistics or OECD reports.</p>
<p>Another, related but different source of healthcare expenditure data, is the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), which publishes the Statistics of Public Expenditure for Economic Development (SPEED). This source relies primarily on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<h3 id="definitions"> <a class="deep-link" href="#definitions"># </a>Definitions</h3>
<p>In the WHO&#8217;s global health expenditure database (GHED), total expenditure on health is calculated as the sum of public health expenditure (also referred to as general government expenditure) and private health expenditure. The former is calculated by adding up all outlays paid by government entities (ministries, parastatal organizations or social security agencies), regardless of the source (so includes in principle any donor funding passing through them). The latter is calculated by adding up outlays for health by private entities (households, commercial health insurance, non-profit institutions). The WHO produces an <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database/DocumentationCentre/GetFile/52869001/en">Indicator Codebook</a> that provides detailed information about the definitions of all of the variables in their dataset.</p>
<h3 id="measurement-limitations"> <a class="deep-link" href="#measurement-limitations"># </a>Measurement limitations</h3>
<p>The GHED has been maintained for the past ten years with the intent of providing comparable expenditure figures across countries and time, and its estimates rely on national health accounts based on reports from ministries, central banks, national statistics offices and international agencies such as the OECD. Since not all countries have (or update) national health accounts, the GHED&#8217;s estimates often require imputation for missing values. Lu et al.

Their conclusion is that the WHO&#8217;s adjustment process requires substantial imputations for missing data; and that the distinction between actual reported data and imputed estimates is not clearly stated in their published tables. After reviewing the methodology used by the WHO, the authors concluded that the imputation methods are not standardised, and that the imputations are often based on the assumption that the ratio of government health spending to general government spending remains constant with time.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the IMF also tracks public spending on health, and is one of the underlying sources used by the WHO for their GHED estimates. Lu et al. (2000) compare IMF reports with WHO estimates and conclude that the correlation between them is only 0.65. They argue the discrepancies arise because IMF values are more likely to represent data from ministries of finance than from ministries of health.</p>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned issues, international cross-country comparisons of healthcare financing estimates are also problematic due to lack of consistency in classification of expenditures, especially on the borderline of health services. Even across OECD countries, where there is a framework of harmonised accounting, there are issues of completeness and comparability, particularly across time.<a id='ref-41' class='side-matter side-matter-ref' href='#note-41'><sup class='side-matter side-matter-sup' title='See, for instance, the report Guidelines to improve estimates of expenditure on health administration and health insurance'>41</sup></a> An example of this problem is the classification of care for disabilities. Culver and Newhouse (2000) mention that expenditure on intellectual developmental disabilities is not included in the healthcare figures from Denmark and Sweden after 1985, but it is included in the figures from Finland, Iceland and Norway.</p>

According to the source, the data refers to &#8216;non-institutionalized civilian population&#8217;, in the sense that it excludes care provided to residents of institutions, such as long-term care facilities and penitentiaries, as well as care for military and other non-civilian members of the population.

						<p>Interestingly, there are important institutional variables that are also significantly correlated with healthcare expenditure after controlling for income. For example, the use of primary care “gatekeepers” seems to result in lower health expenditure. And lower levels of health expenditure also appear to occur in systems where the patient first pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement, compared to other systems.

						<p> Whether healthcare spending is highly responsive to price changes in other contexts is still the subject of academic discussion. We reference here empirical evidence from developing countries, focusing on price changes in the form of user fees. Other studies focusing on other populations find different results. For an interesting (technical) discussion about estimates of price elasticity of healthcare in the U.S. see Kowalski, Amanda. &#8220;Censored quantile instrumental variable estimates of the price elasticity of expenditure on medical care.&#8221; Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics 34.1 (2016): 107-117. </p>

						<p>Graph produced by Max Roser on 25 July 2016 using <a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm">OECD data on health spending</a> and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN">World Bank data on life expectancy at birth</a>.</h6>
<p>The definition of health spending given by the OECD is the following: &#8220;Health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services (i.e. current health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (prevention and public health services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments. Health care is financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance (“public”) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households’ out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (“private”). This indicator is presented as a total and by type of financing (“public”, “private”, “out-of-pocket”) and is measured as a share of GDP, as a share of total health spending and in USD per capita (using economy-wide PPPs).&#8221;</p>

						<p>Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are increasingly common in the developing world. There is substantial evidence suggesting that CCTs have a significant impact on the intended outcomes, typically schooling, health, infant mortality, child labor, and poverty reduction. For an overview of CCTs and their impacts in Latin America – the region that pioneered large-scale CCTs – see Handa, S., &amp; Davis, B. (2006). The experience of conditional cash transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean. Development policy review, 24(5), 513-536.</p>

						<p>A recent report commissioned by The Lancet, using evidence similar to what we discuss here, concludes that &#8220;[a] unique characteristic of our generation is that collectively we have the financial and the ever-improving technical capacity to reduce infectious, child, and maternal mortality rates to low levels universally by 2035, to achieve a “grand convergence” in health. With enhanced investments to scale up health technologies and systems, these rates in most low-income and middle-income countries would fall to those presently seen in the best-performing middle-income countries.&#8221; (Jamison, Dean T., et al. &#8220;<a href="http://dcp-3.org/sites/default/files/resources/Global%20Health%202035%20Report.pdf">Global health 2035: a world converging within a generation</a>.&#8221; The Lancet 382.9908 (2013): 1898-1955).</p>
