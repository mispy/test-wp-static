OurWorldInData is an online publication that shows how living conditions around the world are changing. It communicates this empirical knowledge through interactive data visualisations (charts and maps) and by presenting the research findings on global development that explain what drives the changes that we see and what the consequences of these changes are.

The publication is developed at the <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/world-data">University of Oxford</a> and covers a wide range of topics across many academic disciplines: Trends in health, food provision, the growth and distribution of incomes, violence, rights, wars, culture, energy use, education, and environmental changes are empirically analysed and visualised in this web publication. For each topic the quality of the data is discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website is also a database of databases. Covering all of these aspects in one resource makes it possible to understand how the observed long-run trends are interlinked and the research on global development is presented to the audience of interested readers, journalists, academics, and policy people. The articles cross-reference each other to make it possible for the reader to learn about the drivers of the observed long-run trends. For each topic the quality of the data will be discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website works as a database of databases ‚Äì a meta-database.

Our World In Data is made available as a <em><strong>public good:</strong></em> The entire publication is freely available, the data published on the website is available for download, the visualizations published in the web publication are made available under a permissive Creative Commons license, and all the tools to publish OurWorldInData and to create the visualizations are free to use by everyone (completely open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/OurWorldInData/our-world-in-data-grapher">GitHub here</a>).
<h2>What do I find at Our World in Data?</h2>
The idea is to tell the history of our present world ‚Äì based on empirical data and visualised in graphs. Individual data entries deal with the different aspects of living standards. These entries are arranged into <a title="Data" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/">the 16 categories that you find in the data section</a>.

We need to know in which aspects the world has seen progress and why and we also need to show where people live in destitute conditions and present clearly what the big challenges of today are. This helps us to prioritize where and on which aspects policy makers and all of us focus our efforts.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the long-run trends are positive and paint an optimistic view of our world that is unknown to many who only follow the daily news to inform themselves about the world. The research presented on OurWorldInData backs up the statement by Karl Popper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_popper-english-quote.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7157"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7157" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_popper-english-quote-750x375.png" alt="Popper-English-Quote" width="750" height="375" /></a> The empirical view of our world shows how the Enlightenment continues to make our world a better place. It chronicles how human societies became <a title="Homicides" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/violence-rights/homicides/">less violent</a> and increasingly more <a title="Democratisation" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/political-regimes/democratisation/">democratic</a>. The empirical evidence shows how new ideas continue to <a title="Light" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/economic-development-work-standard-of-living/light/">improve living standards</a>, allowing us to live a <a title="Life Expectancy" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/">healthier</a>, <a title="GDP Growth Over the Last Centuries" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-growth-over-the-last-centuries/">richer</a> and <a title="Happiness and Life Satisfaction" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/economic-development-work-standard-of-living/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/">happier</a> life. It is the story of <a title="World Poverty" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">declining poverty</a> and <a title="Food per Person" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/food-per-person/">better food provision</a> in a world <a title="Forest Cover" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/environmental-change/forest-cover/">we care about</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The empirical view on our world shows how misplaced doom and defeatism is and my aim is to encourage those who work to make our world a better place still. At the same time my hope is also to help to change the mind of those of you who do not think that we are creating a better world. By looking at the empirical data I want to explain why I am optimistic about how we are changing our world and why I think it is worthwhile to engage in the global long-term project of Enlightenment. Although most trends are clearly going in the right direction I also show where this is not the case. In a world of hysteria we cannot focus on what is important, but a fact based view on our world should help us to focus on the topics that are most important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We need to present the research that lets us understand why living conditions change. What is driving progress to improve global health and education and how can we further reduce extreme poverty, violence, hunger? We need to bridge the gap between researchers and the public and clearly show that we have it in our hands to work towards a world where living conditions are improving for all of us. We can be more effective when the public ‚Äì including policy makers, journalists, and academics ‚Äì knows where and how we need to act to improve living conditions for every person around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the feedback I know that readers of Our World In Data include academics, policy makers that need to know what works in global development, journalists that want to have a longer view on current events, professors and teachers who use the material for their students, and many laypeople interested in global development.¬† Many members of the general public are interested in how the world is changing but find it hard to get access to the relevant research.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The data-entries on OurWorldInData</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On OurWorldInData overview articles ‚Äì called data entries ‚Äì give the reader an overview of how a particular social, economic or ecological aspect of the world has changed over the long run. The content structure of each data-entry on OurWorldInData is shown in the following figure:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_data-entry-structure.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7163"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7163" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_data-entry-structure-750x383.png" alt="Data Entry Structure" width="750" height="383" /></a>In the <strong>1st section</strong> of every data entry ‚Äì the section titled ‚ÄòEmpirical View‚Äô ‚Äì we present the most important facts of the long-term development of the topic of that data entry. The presentation of these trends makes use of interactive data visualizations and presents the available empirical evidence about what we know about the historical development (up to now) about each of the many different aspects of global development. The data visualizations are a distinctive feature of OurWorldInData and are often used in journalistic and academic articles, on social media and in school and university teaching.</p>
Here is an example for a data visualization in section 1: The world map shows how life expectancy has changed over time. Use the slider below the map to see the change over time. (If you click on Chart in the top right corner you can explore the change for each country in the world.)
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/64?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>Section 2</strong> is titled ‚ÄòDeterminants &amp; Consequences‚Äò. To illustrate and communicate the research findings in this section we also use data visualizations ‚Äì while the summarized (and referenced) research will show the current evidence on what is behind the observed changes and what they mean for our living conditions. To give a concrete <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/">example</a>, while the peer-reviewed research on the causal links between mother‚Äôs education and higher child survival is summarized, this same section is illustrated with the correlation of these two measures across countries.

<strong>Section 3</strong> is a very important section: Too often empirical studies are not critical enough about the data that is used in their empirical research (and this is equally an issue for data visualizations which are shared online for example on social media sites). Section 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄòMeasurement, Data Quality &amp; Definitions‚Äô ‚Äì defines the used measures and explains the limitations of the empirical data by reviewing the literature that scrutinizes data sets.

<strong>Section 4</strong> is pointing the visitor to the relevant original data sources and allows policy makers and interested researchers to study the empirical evidence themselves. This section of each data-entry links to the original sources of the data: This can either be a 1) specialized institute (like the Peace Research Institute Oslo PRIO) or a 2) research article (like Bourguignon &amp; Morrison ‚Äì ‚ÄôInequality Among World Citizens: 1820-1992‚Äô in the American Economic Review [2002]) or a 3) statistical agency that provides relevant data. This section makes the web publication a database of databases ‚Äì a meta-database.

The presentation of text and data makes use of the capabilities of online publishing. Almost all publications on the web ‚Äì including those in the best journals ‚Äì are currently just emulating the possibilities (and restrictions) of publishing on paper. They are published online, yet they as static combinations of text and visuals which were essentially already at the disposal of Johannes Gutenberg when he invented the printing press in the 1440s. OurWorldInData uses the possibilities of the web ‚Äì links that show the interconnectedness of development, options are available to search and explore the publication, and the empirical evidence is presented in interactive visualizations for which OurWorldInData is famous. OurWorldInData moves publishing from a static medium to a dynamic medium with computational responsiveness.
<h2>The 'Grapher'</h2>
The OurWorldInData‚ÄìGrapher is at the heart of this publication. It is the tool that allows us to store all data in an online database and then to visualise this data in line charts, maps, bar charts, scatter plots, area charts etc.

As everything else on OurWorldInData the Grapher is also completely open source.

You find more ‚Äì many examples, a video that shows the backend, and everything else ‚Äì on the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/OWID-grapher/">OurWorldInData page about the Grapher</a>.
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Team</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intention for this publication was always to be a collaborative publication and from 2015 onwards several researchers and web developers contributed to the content and expanded the technical framework of the publication:</p>

<h2>Why are we working on Our World In Data?</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1) Because the daily news are not enough to know about the world</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To understand how the world is changing it is not enough to follow the daily news. The news that make the headlines focus on events and fail to communicate the slow trends that slowly, and persistently reshape our world.
The important consequence of the media‚Äôs focus on events rather than slow trends is that global development does not get reported. Harm is done in an instant and disasters are happening at once: an earthquake, a plane crash, or the attack of a group of terrorists. In contrast, many of the best news for life on earth are shaped by trends that slowly and over the course of decades or centuries change our world: <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/">Global child mortality fell from 18.2% in 1960 to 4.3% in 2015</a>; while 4.3% is still too high, this is a substantial achievement. But understandably on no day in the last 5 decades was there ever the headline ‚ÄòGlobal Child Mortality Fell by 0.00719% Since Yesterday‚Äô. This is not necessarily a critique of the news media, but it does mean that we have to do more to see that global development is reality. We have to communicate how global living conditions are gradually changing and OurWorldInData aims to be a complementary source that informs us all about the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The motivation for publishing OurWorldInData could not be explained better than in the words of Albert Schweitzer who realized several decades ago:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_schweitzer-english-quote.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7156"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7156" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_schweitzer-english-quote-750x375.png" alt="Schweitzer-English-Quote" width="750" height="375" /></a>
Now we can make a publication on real progress possible, with a reach and in a technological form that was unimaginable by Schweitzer.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2) To make it possible to know about global development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that the media fails to communicate a large part of global development would be less an issue if our own perception would provide us with an accurate representation of how the world is changing.
Unfortunately this is not the case. And even worse, the lack of information on global development is compounded by, rather than corrected by, our perception: We are bad intuitive statisticians. This ‚Äì in a nutshell ‚Äì is the research result of psychologists and behavioral economists, summarized in Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>.
Two of the important biases that make us such bad intuitive statisticians are:
‚Äì¬†¬† ¬†The <em>availability heuristic</em> biases our perception towards the events that we see repeatedly and for which we can recall examples easily. This is aggravating the predicament of a media that mostly focuses on gloomy event news.
‚Äì¬†¬† ¬†The <em>negativity bias</em> describes the fact that our perception responds more strongly to unpleasant news. From an evolutionary perspective it is clear that it is most important for an organism to survive that it notices danger and threats and therefore to focus on these aspects of our world. But what makes us well equipped for our immediate daily surrounding makes us ill-equipped to understand the world around us at large. The consequence of which is that we pay excessive attention to threats and losses and fail to see opportunities and gains.
To balance these biases we have to develop greater sensitivity in measuring opportunities and gains and we have to measure slow changes over time accurately. To develop this clear-eyed view of our world is what scientists around the world are doing. To communicate these gains, opportunities, and slow trends and to make this research accessible for all of us is what OurWorldInData.org aims to do.
As the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26616">put it</a> when examining why we fail to see human progress: ‚Äòthe diagnosis comes from cognitive science and the cure from data science‚Äô.</p>
The available evidence for how well informed we are about the world suggests that in important aspects this work is vital. Studies show that the public‚Äôs knowledge of how the world is changing in important aspects is sadly rather low. The study ‚Äò<a href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/_assets/sri/perils/">Perils of Perception</a>‚Äô published annually by Ipsos MORI, for example, showed how wrong the British public were about some of the most important trends:¬† <a href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx">One of the findings</a> of the study was that 58% of the British public do not believe that crime is falling, when in fact the ‚ÄòCrime Survey for England and Wales‚Äô shows that incidents of crime in 2012 were 53% lower than in 1995.
Similarly the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/">Gapminder Ignorance Project</a> ‚Äì focusing not on domestic but global trends ‚Äì found that 66% of people in the USA believed that ‚Äòthe proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty‚Äô has increased in the past 30 years.¬† Only 5% of the public knew that it has actually decreased (<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">here</a> is Our World In Data showing the evidence). As the chart below shows, the empirical knowledge about one of the most fundamental changes in our time is not much better in the population with a university degree in the UK.
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_igonorace-in-uk-on-global-poverty-university-population.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7161"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7161" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_igonorace-in-uk-on-global-poverty-university-population-750x525.png" alt="Igonorace-in-UK-on-Global-Poverty-(University-population)" width="750" height="525" /></a>
The issue we are tackling with Our World In Data is that the barriers for the general public to get informed by the important quantitative social research carried out in academic institutions are frustratingly high. OurWorldInData changes this and makes research on social, economic and environmental trends accessible.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3) To pursue more of what works and to get engaged in a world that achieves progress</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The annual question of the science portal Edge is ‚ÄúWhat do you consider the most interesting recent scientific news?‚Äù and Professor <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26616">Steven Pinker answered</a> that in his opinion it is the possibility to ‚Äúquantify human progress‚Äù.
Pinker explains why he considers this to be the most important and interesting news: <em>"Foremost, quantified progress is a feedback signal for adjusting what we have been doing. The gifts of progress we have enjoyed are the result of institutions and norms that have become entrenched in the last two centuries: reason, science, technology, education, expertise, democracy, regulated markets, and a moral commitment to human rights and human flourishing."</em>
The motivation of publishing Our World In Data is indeed to be more constructive about development. We have to know what works so that we pursue more of it. To me this is also about trust in our institutions and about believing in each other. It is too easy to be cynical about the world and cynicism is leading to misanthropy.</p>
The absence of information on global development has an additional sorry consequence: The lack of feedback on our efforts as a society can make us lose trust in ourselves and at the extreme make us lose will to change the world for the better.
Here is how a reader of OurWorldInData put it in an email: ‚Äúnobody is able to accomplish anything when ones mind is preoccupied with negative news, insecurity, and fear. Quite the contrary, to achieve something great we need to know that our efforts are worthwhile, yet understand that many aspects need our work so that we can further improve our world."
It is disempowering if we wrongly think that we are going down the wrong way and contrariwise it can be empowering to know that we are doing something right.
It reinforces development also because it makes us ask questions. To see how agricultural yields have increased or how the child mortality rate is falling in all countries in the world makes you ask questions.
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4) To communicate what we know about global development, to choose better policies</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim for the web publication OurWorldInData.org is to bring together the best available quantitative research on the many different aspects of global development and to present the most reliable empirical data openly to the public.
We believe that communicating knowledge about global development matters for the quality of our democratic political system and ultimately for better decisions by policy makers and citizens. Democracy depends on informed citizens and the knowledge on global development and global challenges will help us to seek better policies.
Democracy crucially depends on informed consent and people view their world very different if they falsely believe that global living conditions are getting worse.¬† Fortunately empirical evidence is increasingly becoming the basis for political discussions and decisions and this project will provide a database for discussants to refer to. It is helpful for this form of political debate because while statistics are becoming the principal language of public argument, a comprehensive platform on global development accessible to the interested citizen does not exist.</p>
OurWorldInData is motivated by the sense that statistics are the dominant language of public argument. The interactive visualizations ‚Äì licensed under a permissive <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA-Creative Commons license</a> ‚Äì are directly <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/media-coverage/">usable for journalists</a> (who can either copy the visualizations or directly embed them in their web publications). The experience with Our World In Data shows that many of us do pay attention to evidence and that there is a strong demand for the research on global development presented in this publication. The reason why research and data on global development does not play a larger part in the public debate and perception is the gap between academia and the wider public. For researchers, policy makers, and the public an open approach to empirical evidence is the best way to maximize the benefits of research.
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5) To know where to focus our efforts</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our World In Data always shows both, the change so far and the challenge ahead. <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/VisualHistoryOf/Poverty.html">In the Visual History of World Poverty</a> we see the reduction of extreme poverty from 44% in 1981 to less than 10% in 2015. This reduction is an extraordinary achievement. But at the same this data visualisation and <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">the accompanying data-entry</a> on OurWorldInData¬† also show that almost 10% of the world population live in extreme poverty ‚Äì clearly an outrageously high number of individuals that live in abysmal living conditions in our present world.
The medical doctor and director of the Global Burden of Disease study Chris Murray believes that ‚ÄúYou could solve humanity‚Äôs most pressing problems once you recognize them [‚Ä¶] that‚Äôs why I keep obsessing about marshaling the facts and putting them in a way for people who need to think about them‚Äù.[ref]Cited after Jeremy Smith (2015) ‚Äì Epic Measures - One Doctor. Seven Billion Patients. <a href="https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780062237507/epic-measures">https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780062237507/epic-measures</a>[/ref] OurWorldInData does both, it shows the successes so far and the pressing challenges ahead so that we know where we should focus our efforts.
We are convinced that portraying the difficult yet successful efforts of humanity will be a helpful way to look at history and our present condition. In this spirit our work is directed against cynicism and in favor of engagement in a developing world.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6) To communicate a broad understanding of development ‚Äì not just economic growth</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The perception and discussion of development is focused on a single, narrow aspect of development: Economic growth.
The growth of incomes is important, yet it is a means to an end and certainly it is no guarantee that we achieve the ends of development that we care about (health, education, human freedom, sustainable relationship with nature and more). Our World In Data promotes a broad understanding of what development means. The aim is to broaden the debate and make measures of health and other aspects of development as ubiquitous and easy to access as data on economic output is today.
The Millennium Development Goals with a focus on health and even more the Sustainable Development Goals with the understanding that development is even broader were steps in the right direction. Our World In Data gives this perspective a permanent home.</p>
As recommended by <a href="http://www.insee.fr/fr/publications-et-services/dossiers_web/stiglitz/doc-commission/RAPPORT_anglais.pdf">Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi (2009)</a>, GDP per capita remains an important part of the empirical perspective on development, but the measure will not be used to capture aspects that it is not able to capture. For the wider range of aspects of development OurWorldInData will also follow the recommendation of the Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi report and present a range of indicators (dashboard approach). The website is therefore structured into 16 categories and aims to communicate the empirical research on all of these aspects:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) Population Growth &amp; Vital Statistics
(2) Health
(3) Food &amp; Agriculture
(4) Resources &amp; Energy
(5) Environmental Change
(6) Technology &amp; Infrastructure
(7) Growth &amp; Distribution of Prosperity
(8) Economic Development, Work &amp; Standard of Living
(9) The Public Sector &amp; Economic System
(10) Global Interconnections
(11) War &amp; Peace
(12) Political Regime
(13) Violence &amp; Rights
(14) Education &amp; Knowledge
(15) Media &amp; Communication
(16) Culture, Values &amp; Society</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7) To counter fatalism and make us appreciate the progress the world has achieved</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nostalgia for a better past is widespread and many see the world in decline.

Our World In Data seeks to put this widespread pessimism in context. In the best case people will question their pessimism about the world and it is an initiative that fosters a kind of public optimism. For this effort to succeed we need to present the picture of true progress that we see in the data.¬† Steven Pinker <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26616">again</a>: <em>"Quantified human progress emboldens us to seek more of it. A common belief among activists is that any optimistic datum must be suppressed lest it lull people into complacency. Instead, one must keep up the heat by wailing about ongoing crises and scolding people for being insufficiently terrified. Unfortunately, this can lead to a complementary danger: fatalism.‚Äù</em>

Because our hopes and efforts for building a better future are inextricably linked to our perception of the past it is important to understand and communicate the global development up to now. Studying our world in data and understanding how we overcame challenges that seemed insurmountable at the time should also give us confidence and guidance to tackle the problems we are currently facing. It is easy to be cynical about the world and to maintain that nothing is ever getting better. But fortunately the empirical evidence often contradicts this view. We believe it is partly due to a lack of relevant and understandable information that a negative view on how the world is changing is so very common.
This is the perspective on the world that OurWorldInData presents and the ambition is that seeing the world through this online publication makes more of us appreciate the progress the world has achieved and seek more of it in the future.
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Impact of OurWorldInData</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started preparing this publication in 2011 and in June last year and made the website available online in June 2014. Since then more than 2,00,000 people have visited OurWorldInData.org. Over the last year more than <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/media-coverage/">200 articles</a> portrayed the project or used material on global development from OurWorldInData.</p>
English speaking media outlets using OurWorldInData include <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post, Forbes, Slate, Vox, Foreign Policy, Thomson Reuters, The Guardian, Quartz, Bloomberg, World Economic Forum, Business Insider, The Financial Times, and the New Yorker.</em>
Non-English speaking media outlets using OurWorldInData include La Presse (Canada &amp; France), Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung (Switzerland), Svenska Dagbladet (Sweden), Veja (Brazil), Les Echos (France), Bild am Sonntag (Germany), Polimaty (Poland), Aftenposten (Norway), Rue 89 (France), Blic (Serbia), Chabad (Israel), Scientias (Dutch), Jutarnji (Croatia), Rusplt (Russian), Kushima (Japan), Berlingske (Denmark), Vice (Italy), Contrepoints (France), RPP (Peru), S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (Germany), Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Germany), and Der Spiegel (Germany).
<p style="text-align: justify;">In videos and television material from Our World In Data has been used by the BBC in <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/">an hour-long documentary on global poverty with Hans Rosling</a>, by German speaking stations (such as ORF), and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5DZF7YvwwM">work</a> of the author John Green.
On the radio and in podcasts Our World In Data and its content was discussed in detail by public radio stations in Germany (SWR, BR, Deutschland Radio), <a href="http://datastori.es/data-stories-57-human-dev-w-max-roser/">Data Stories</a>, Forschergeist, and WNYC (<a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/news-grim-until-you-look-data/">Takeaway</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the feedback we know that the content of OurWorldInData is used widely in teaching and in lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visualising data is a form of knowledge compression and the experience has shown that investing in Our World In Data is therefore an effective way to communicate research through the media and influence policy and public understanding of our world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">History of OurWorldInData</h2>
In 2011 I started working on this publication by myself. The first idea was to write a book that presents a long-run perspective on global development, but since I found it was difficult to find the empirical literature and empirical data on global development¬†I changed these plans and decided to provide this basic information for everyone online myself. In the following years my supervisor Sir Tony Atkinson and I developed the concept for such a publication, I collected a lot of data to structure and plan this publication. Over the following years this was my project that I worked on on weekends and the evenings. In 2014 I was done with¬†a first basic version of the¬†website and made OurWorldInData available online.

Over the course of 2015 the project was hosted at the Institute for New Economic Thinking and the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford while the financial support was provided by a small research grant from the London-based Nuffield Foundation.
Now, from 2016 onwards this work will be carried out at the University of Oxford‚Äôs <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Martin School</a>. The Martin School is an interdisciplinary research institution within the University of Oxford and close links between the publication of OurWorldInData and the Martin School already exist. However, funding is only secured for the first 6 months of 2016 and during this period the project has to be successful to secure funding for a longer time horizon, otherwise it will not continue.

&nbsp;

The Oxford Martin School was chosen as the institution to host this work as it is a truly interdisciplinary research institution with a focus on the challenges of global development. It is therefore the ideal place to carry out this research.
A small selection of the names of the <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/">other programs</a> at the Martin School makes clear that there is a close-knit research environment around OurWorldInData from which this publication can benefit: Global Health, Armed Conflict, Migration, Climate Change, Food, Vaccines, and the Future of Humanity Programme are some of the related programmes.
Collaborations with several of these and other research programs of the Martin School are already established and were already useful in the development of OurWorldInData.org.

The best aspect of the work on Our World In Data was that we are now able to work on this project as a team. The web developer Jaiden Mispy and the research economist Dr Esteban Ortiz Ospina have both made a tremendous contribution to this free online publication. Their work is only possible thanks to the very generous donations that we receive from readers! (You can support our work <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/support/">here</a>.)
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Work in Progress</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right now this website is still very much work in progress. We are always looking for data. So if you know of or come across some data that might be relevant for this project please let me know. There is a full <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/list-of-all-data-entries/">List of all current and future data-entries</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How we choose which data to present</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 7 guidelines to decide which sources to accept and which data to present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1) As far back into the past as possible - but up to today</strong>
The goal is to give a perspective on the long-term development and therefore we always aimed for finding data series that reach back as far as possible. Unfortunately the availability of data is often itself an achievement of modern development and data is not available for the more distant past. A solution for this problem is data that has later been reconstructed and we aim to give a more complete picture by taking this data into account.
At the same time the idea is also to present a 'history of the present' and we therefore also want to ensure that the data presented reaches until today.
<strong>2) As global as possible</strong>
A second objective is to give an account of each topic that includes as many societies, countries, and world regions as possible.
<strong>3) Present data in its entirety</strong>
Shorter sample periods may mask important trends and a recent reversal of a long-term trend could be falsely interpreted as the direction of the long-term trend. The merit of taking a historical perspective that studies long-term trends is that it shows the direction in which some aspect of our world is developing. Therefore we also always ensure to present the whole dataset and we do not want to cut off the original data.
<strong>4) Comparable through time and across societies</strong>
A third objective is to ensure that the data we present is comparable across time and across societies. In particular absolute numbers are mostly not meaningful when compared between societies with very different population sizes. It is not surprising that there are many more higher educated people today than a century ago, but this obviously does not mean that the educational background of today's population is better than in the past ‚Äì it could simply mean that there are more people overall. To make measures comparable we aim to include relative measures that account for the differences in population size.
<strong>5) There is no other data - or we would include this data</strong>
An important promise is that we are not withholding any data that would give a different impression of the long-term development of some aspect. If two credible sources would publish statistics that contradict each other then we would say so.
<strong>6) Reference the original source</strong>
To make the data base useful for readers and credit the important work of those who construct the data presented here we aim to always reference the original source of the data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We could very well fail to notice that we violated our own guidelines: If you find that we are not following my own guidelines, or you have any other complaints, please contact us through the form above.</p>

This entry presents the empirical research on the slow rise of democratic regimes over the last two centuries.

Democracies are distinct from autocratic countries in which political preferences cannot be expressed and citizens are not guaranteed civil liberties. Anocracies ‚Äì a term used often in this entry ‚Äì are regimes that fall in the middle of the spectrum of autocracies and democracies. Anocracies are countries which are not fully autocratic, but which can also not be called democratic.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Number of Democracies</h3>
The majority of the world's countries are now governed by democratic regimes, defined as systems with citizen political participation, constraints on the power of the executive, and a guarantee of civil liberties. The visualization below shows the slow increase of democratic countries over the last 200 years. The rise of democracies has been interrupted by the atrocities during the two World Wars ‚Äì many young democracies fell back to become autocratic ahead of the Second World War.
After 1945 the number of democracies has started to grow again, but the very dramatic shift towards a democratic world has been the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1989. By clicking on 'Autocracies' and 'Anocracies', you can also see that after 1989 the number of autocracies has decreased dramatically while the number of anocracies initially increased then has stayed fairly stable.
<h6>Number of democracies between 1800-2010[ref]</h6>
The source of the data is the polity IV dataset which is available online <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm">here</a>. I have only included countries with a population greater than 500,000.[/ref]

<h3>Share of World Population Living in Democracies</h3>
The mere number of democratic countries does not us how many people in the world actually enjoy democratic rights since the population in different countries varies hugely. Therefore it is more interesting to look at the number of people governed by different political regimes. This is shown in the chart below.
By clicking on 'Relative', the following graph shows the share of people living in different regimes over the last two centuries.
In the 19th century most people in the world lived in autocratically ruled countries or in countries that were colonized by imperial powers. This changed completely over the second half of the 20th centuries: Former colonies became independent and autocratic countries became democracies. By 1997 more than half of the world's population lived in democratic regimes, and that proportion has stayed fairly stable since.
We see a country by country breakdown below, but it is worth pointing out that 4 out of 5 people in the world that live in an autocracy live in China.

<h3>World maps of political regimes over 200 years</h3>
The world has changed: 2 centuries ago most countries were autocratically ruled or part of a colonial empire, today most countries are democracies. The map below shows the data for 2015, but you can move the slider at the bottom past to see this change over the last 2 centuries.
Most countries in Europe and the Americas have become democracies. Some parts of Africa - especially in the West and the South - have democratized and so have countries in Asia; India is the world's largest democracy. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Mongolia are all full democracies according to the Polity IV evaluation.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/political-regime-updated2016" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Political freedom is a very recent achievement</h3>
The following world map¬†of the age of democratic regimes¬†shows that a democratic world is only a very recent achievement. It also indicates that economic success goes together with political liberation. The countries that have democratized first are mostly those countries that first achieved economic growth. The present rates of economic growth in the poorer countries of the world therefore give hope for further democratization around the world.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h4>Countries with higher educational attainment in the past are more likely to have democratic political regimes today</h4>
A long-standing theory in political science stipulates that a country's level of education attainment is a key determinant of the emergence and sustainability of democratic political institutions, both because it promotes political participation at the individual level, and because it fosters a collective sense of civic duty.

Under this hypothesis, therefore, we should expect that education levels in a country correlate positively with measures of democratisation in subsequent years. The following visualization shows that this positive correlation is indeed supported by the data. As we can see, countries where adults had a higher average education level in 1970, are also more likely to have democratic political regimes today (you can read more about measures of democracy in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democratisation">Democratization</a>).

As usual, these results should be interpreted carefully, because they do not imply a causal link: it does not prove that increasing education necessarily produces democratic outcomes everywhere in the world.
However, the academic research here does suggest that there is a causal link between education and democratization ‚Äì indeed, a number of empirical academic papers have found that this positive relationship remains after controlling for many other country characteristics (see, for example, Lutz, Crespo-Cuaresma, and Abbasi‚ÄêShavazi 2010[ref]Lutz, W., Crespo Cuaresma, J., &amp; Abbasi‚ÄêShavazi, M. J. (2010). Demography, education, and democracy: Global trends and the case of Iran. Population and Development Review, 36(2), 253-281.[/ref]).

<h4>Colonial past</h4>
Above we have shown all of today's countries that were part of a colonial empire in purple. This map now shows which other country was the colonial power that ruled over another country. Press the 'Play' at the bottom to see the change over time.

The borders shown throughout this visualisation are today's borders. It would be preferable to show the historical borders and the changes over time; the current solution is a limitation of our technical framework that cannot (yet) show border changes.<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/colonialism-and-imperialism" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Why we chose the Polity IV as the main source for democracy measures</h3>
<div>It is necessarily controversial to <span class="il">measure</span> a complex concept such as <span class="il">the type of a political regime</span> in a single metric. But since it can be useful to quantify the political regime characteristics so that it is possible to compare political regimes over time and between countries and to study the drivers and consequences of political regime change quantitatively. For example a field of study where this can be useful is studying the link between democratisation and the end of mass <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines/">famines</a>.</div>
<div>

A much cited, thorough evaluation of commonly used democracy measures has been presented by Munck and Verkuilen (2002).[ref]Munck and Verkuilen (2002) - Conceptualizing and Measuring Democracy Evaluating Alternative Indices. In Comparative Political Studies, 35, 1, 5--34.[/ref] Unfortunately the authors find a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of the empirical scope and the quality of the assessment in terms of conceptualization, measurement and aggregation. According to the authors, the Polity IV measures are a 'partial exception' of this tradeoff, and therefore I rely on these measures mostly in this entry. In general, the Polity IV defines democracy as a system which has institutions in which citizens can express their preferences, has constraints on the power of the executive, and a guarantee of civil liberties. It defines an autocracy as a system that restricts political participation by citizens, has executives chosen within the political elite, and executives with few institutional constraints.

</div>
<div>The Polity IV measure used here is certainly also questionable ‚Äì as would every other alternative ‚Äì but we chose it as my main source because based on our comparison with alternatives and the paper by Munck and Verkuilen (2002) it is the best available option, particularly if a long-run perspective is the main objective.</div>
<div>We also have to keep in mind that this <span class="il">measure</span> cannot capture everything that matters for a political regime. For example it makes sense to <span class="il">measure</span> corruption or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights/">human rights</a> separately from the <span class="il">democracy</span> concept. Not because it doesn't matter but because all aspects matter and for different question we want to be able to differentiate between the importance of different factors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Particularly good about the Polity IV measures is that the data source has a detailed explanation for each country why a country was classified in a particular way in a particular year: You find these country by country explanations in the pdf files <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/">here</a>.</div>
<h3>Comparison of different regime measures</h3>
This graph compares the political regime measures that are available for a very long time - since the early 19th century: the Polyarchy measure and the Polity measure and for a shorter period the the Freedom House measure. Shown is the share of democratic countries among all independent countries. There are some differences but the graphs shows they largely move together.

<h3>Moore's Law - Exponential Increase of the Number of Transistors on Integrated Circuits</h3>
Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. This accelerating progress is important as the capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's Law and are¬†improving exponentially. I will show how aspects as diverse as processing speed, product price, memory capacity, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras have been progressing with similar speed.

The law was described as early as 1965 by the Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore after whom it is named.[ref]The original paper of Moore (1965) is still hosted by Intel <a href="http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf">here</a>. [/ref]

Before we look at the development so far, I have reprinted the famous little graph that Moore published in 1965.
<h6>Moore's Original Graph: 'The Number of Components per Integrated Function' ‚Äì¬†Intel[ref]</h6>
The source of the graph is Intel <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/events/moores_law_40th/index.htm?iid=tech_mooreslaw+body_presskit">here</a>.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.[/ref]

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Number-of-Components-per-Integrated-Function-Moores-Original-Graph-Moore0.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3954" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Number-of-Components-per-Integrated-Function-Moores-Original-Graph-Moore0.png" alt="The Number of Components per Integrated Function Moore's Original Graph - Moore0" width="358" height="422" /></a>

As you can see, Moore had seven observations from 1959 until 1965 and he predicted a continuing growth saying, "There is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly¬†constant for at least 10 years".[ref]Quoted from the original paper of Moore (1965)¬†<a href="http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf">here</a>. [/ref]¬†As the next graph shows, he was not only right about the next ten years but astonishingly the regularity he found is true for more than half a century now.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.¬†The line corresponds to exponential growth with transistor count doubling every two years.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Transistor-Count-over-time.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7766" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Transistor-Count-over-time-750x548.png" alt="Transistor-Count-over-time" width="750" height="548" /></a>
<h3>Other Laws of Exponential Technological Progress</h3>
In the following, I show that technological developments in many different respects are growing exponentially. Moore's early observation is important as it showed that technological advances do not progress linearly but exponentially. But in and of itself, the doubling of transistors every two years¬†does not directly matter¬†in our lives. Therefore I ask in which ways¬†the exponential growth of technology matters and will give an overview of how the exponential technological advancement is a driver of technological and social change that very much matters for our live now.

More importantly for us is that the power and speed of computers increased exponentially; the doubling time of computational capacity for personal computers was 1.5 years between 1975 to 2009. The increasing power of a wider range of computers - starting with the¬†first general purpose computer (ENIAC)¬†in 1946 - is shown in the following graph.

</a></p>

<h3>Increasing Product Quality for a Decreasing Price</h3>
Increasing computational power - and increasing product quality¬†- matters indeed more than a mere doubling of transistors. But if the technologically-advanced products are prohibitively expensive then they can only have a limited impact on the whole society. For this reason, it is interesting to look at both the product quality and the price.¬†The author and inventor Ray Kurzweil analyzed the change of price and quality for computing machines since 1900. He not only analyzed the improvements of integrated circuits but also looked at the predecessors - earlier transistors, vacuum tubes, relays and electromechanical computers. What he found is that¬†Moore did not only make a valid prediction of the future, but his description is also valid for the past!¬†The exponential growth rate that Moore picked up in the 1960s was driving technological progress since the beginning of the century.

The following graph shows¬†the computer power that consumers could purchase for a price of $1000. It is especially insightful if one wants to understand how technological progress mattered as a driver of social change.
<h6>Calculations per second per $1000 - exponential growth of computing for 110 years ‚Äì¬†Kurzweil[ref]</h6>
The source of this is the website of Kurzweil <a href=" http://www.kurzweilai.net/exponential-growth-of-computing#!prettyPhoto">here</a>.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.[/ref]
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="//ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1480 aligncenter" src="//ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil.png" alt="Calculations per Second per 1000$ - Exponential Growth of Computing for 110 years - Kurzweil" width="802" height="540" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The extension of the time frame also makes clear how our modern computers evolved. It is an insightful way of understanding that the computer age really is the successor to the Industrial Revolution.</p>
One could also view the previous graph as a function of price instead of calculations per second;¬†in this view you would find an exponentially decreasing price for a given product quality over 110 years.

The implication of this rapid simultaneous improvement in quality and decrease of the product price is that, according to a detailed discussion on reddit (<a href="http://de.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1dazzt/how_far_back_in_time_would_i_have_to_go_for_my/">here</a>), a current laptop (May 2013) has about the same computing power as the most powerful computer on earth in the mid 1990s.
<h3>Exponential Increase of the Electrical Efficiency (computing per kWh) of Computing</h3>
The cost to keep the machine running also matters. Electrical efficiency measures the computational capacity per unit of energy, and it is also important with respect to the environmental impact that energy production has.

The progress in this respect has been tremendous: researchers found that over the last six decades the energy demand for a fixed computational load halved every 18 months.[ref]The source of the paper is in the next side note. A short ungated article on this research is in the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/425398/a-new-and-improved-moores-law/">MIT Technology Review</a>.[/ref]

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.¬†Efficiency doubled every 1.57 years from 1946 to 2009.[/ref]

<h3>Exponential Increase of Computer Memory - Exponentially Increasing Storage Capacity and Decreasing Storage Costs</h3>
Looking at these two pictures below it becomes immediately clear how fast technological progress increased the storage capacity. The left image is a hard disk from 1956 with a storage of 5MB on the right is a cheap modern Micro SD Card that stores as much as 12 800 of the old IBM drive.
<h6>The IBM Model 350 disk file with a storage space of 5MB &amp; an¬†8GB Micro SD Card[ref]</h6>
The original press release of IBM to announce the hard disk can be read <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/650/650_pr2.html">here</a> (from September 14, 1956).

The source for the picture of the micro SD is Wikipedia (cropped).[/ref]

&nbsp;

Considering the time since the introduction of the IBM 350 in 1956, the growth rate of storage capacity has not been as constant as for the other measures discussed before. Early on, technological revolutions boosted the capacity stepwise and not linearly. Yet for the time since 1980, progress has been very steady and at an even higher rate than the increase of computer speed.

The hard disk capacity is based on for-retail products.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.

The increase in storage capacity has been called 'Kryder's Law' after the engineer Mark Kryder and a discussion can be found at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kryder">Wikipedia site</a>.[/ref]

<h3>Exponential Increase of the Quality &amp; Exponential Decrease of the Price of Digital Cameras</h3>
Exponentially advancing technological progress can not only be found in computing machines. Cameras are a different example: for a given price consumers can¬†buy cameras with more and more pixels. The number of pixels has¬†again exponentially increased. This is shown in the following graph.
<h6>Exponential growth of pixels per Australian dollar, 1994-2005¬†‚Äì¬†Wikipedia[ref]</h6>
The source is <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hendys_Law.jpg">Wikipedia</a> (cropped).

The prices are recommended retail prices of Kodak digital cameras in Australian Dollars. The source says, 'Typically the cameras have been basic models with no zoom as these deliver the highest Pixels per Dollar'.¬†This has been called Hendy's Law.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.[/ref]

<h3>The Future of Exponential Technological Growth</h3>
The exponential growth rates that we have observed over the last decades seem to¬†promise more exciting technological advances in the future.

Many other types of technology have seen exponential growth rates beyond the ones discussed above. A couple of exceptionally promising examples are: Butters' Law of Photonics and Rose's Law. Butters' Law says the amount of data one can transmit using optical fiber is doubling every nine months,¬†which you can convert¬†and say that the cost of transmission by optical fiber is halving every nine months.¬†Rose's Law describes the exponential growth of the number of qubits of quantum computers. If this growth rate should remain constant, it leads to some mind-bending opportunities.[ref]Here is an article (including a graph of the exponential growth) on Rose's Law by Steve Jurvetson on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/8054771535">flickr</a>.[/ref]

In this section we will look at this more recent time and will also study the inequality between different regions - both in respect to the unequal levels of prosperity today and the unequal economic starting points for leaving the poverty of the pre-growth past.</p>
<p>Economic prosperity is measured as via growth domestic product (GDP) per capita, the the value of all goods and services produced by a country in one year divided by the country‚Äôs population. Economic growth is the measure of the change of GDP¬†from one year to the next. This entry shows that the current experience of economic growth is an absolute exception in the very long-run perspective of social history.</p>
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>GDP per Capita Growth around the World Since the Year 1 CE</h3>
<p>There are many reconstructions of GDP per capita over the last centuries; here I will focus on the reconstructions by the British economist Angus Maddison who was working in Groningen (Netherlands) and where, after his death in 2010, younger colleagues are advancing his work in the 'Maddison Project'.[ref]This data is available at the <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm">website</a> of the Maddison Project. The data constructed by Maddison himself is also available online at his personal <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/oriindex.htm">website</a>.[/ref]</p>
<p>The following graph shows Maddison's reconstructions for eight major world regions.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: left;">Real GDP (absolute levels) by major world region in 1990 Int. $, 1-2008 CE ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>

<p>Maddison's data confirms what he have learned from the very long-run perspective before: before the onset of modern economic growth, every region in the world was extremely¬†poor. But there are also important insights gained from Maddison's data: The starting points of economic growth are very different from region to region. Until the year 1000, everyone was equally poor but we learn that as early as the year 1500 Western Europe had achieved some very limited economic prosperity; until the early 19th century the region could slowly increase the economic wealth. But the wealth enjoyed at the time is still incomparably low with the level that Europe enjoys now at the beginning of the 21st century. Starting from 772 Int. $ in 1500, it doubled until 1820 but since¬†has¬†increased more than 12-fold![ref]According to Maddison's data Western European GDP per capita was 772 Int. $ in 1500, 1572 Int. $ in 1820 and 19912 Int. $ in 2003.[/ref]</p>
<p>In 1700 the 'Western Offshoots' of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US were as poor as any region except Western Europe. But although they had a later start leaving poverty¬†behind, they caught up quickly with Western Europe and surpassed it by 1900.</p>
<p>It is often the case that progress creates inequality between regions¬†because it is not happening equally as fast¬†everywhere, but if we compare the economic prosperity of every region in 2003 with any earlier time we see that every single region is richer than ever before in its history. Though some regions are more productive than others, every region is doing better than ever before - much better.</p>
<p>After looking back on more than a million years of world poverty the question arises: why did economic growth not happen before? Why were our ancestors kept in poverty for millennia after millennia? To answer this question it is helpful to look at just a single country.</p>

<h3>Over the Last Millennia until Now</h3>
<p>Data on economic growth is now routinely published by statistical offices, but researchers have had to reconstruct accounts of the economic productivity for the past. These reconstructions are arguably very uncertain. Nevertheless it is absolutely clear that compared to the prolonged growth of economic productivity in the last centuries, the productivity was always¬†very low before: The difference of prosperity is much¬†greater than the uncertainty of the exact values.</p>
<p>I have included one reconstruction of GDP per capita over the very long run:¬†the last 1,002,000 years. The economist J. Bradford DeLong has constructed the data that I have visualized in this interactive graph.</p>

<p>For this reason I reverted to give years very unequal spacing - admittedly a not so precise way of showing this data either.</p>

<p>What we learn from this chart is that on average the people of the past were many times poorer than we are today. For all the thousands and thousands of years before 1800, the average GDP per capita was lower than just 200 Dollars (1990 International Dollars).[ref]The currency is explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary%E2%80%93Khamis_dollar">here</a>.[/ref] Prosperity is a very recent achievement that distinguishes the last 10 or 20 generations from all of their ancestors. In 2000, the average GDP was 6539$ - more than 30 times the average of the past.</p>
<h3>The Last 2000 Years</h3>
<p>From the data that we have discussed previously,¬†we know that with respect to economic growth all the action really just happened very recently. It is true that in the pre-growth era some people were very well off - but this was a very tiny elite, from tribal leaders to the pharaohs to kings and popes. Yet the average person was very much worse off in these unequal societies.</p>
<p>The destitution of the common man only changed with the onset of economic growth. The time when this change happened is depicted in the following graph - this time again on a regular time axis. From this it becomes clear that economic prosperity was only achieved over the course of the last millennium - really just over the last couple of hundred years. In fact, it was mostly achieved over the second half of the last hundred years.</p>

Much of the focus here is on data produced by the International Institute of Advanced Systems Analysis (IIASA) based in Vienna. The research produced by IIASA is widely used by policy makers concerned with future levels of education and population trends. The methodology used is briefly discussed in this article, however interested readers should study the methodology carefully before making use of the data presented here.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>World Population by Education Level</h3>
The <em>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</em> (IIASA) is an interdisciplinary, highly-respected research institution near Vienna, Austria. The IIASA population projections are the most cited alternative to the UN work.

An interesting feature of the IIASA population projections is that they take into account the education of the population. As shown in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">data-entry on fertility</a> there is a strong link between education and fertility¬†‚Äì more educated women have fewer children. This link is taken into account in the model of the IIASA researchers and contributes to their projection of a smaller total world population than projected by the UN (see the data-entry on world population growth for the comparison).

The breakdown by education level is especially interesting: It shows that our world will be inhabited by more and more educated people.¬†The projection¬†shows that the number of people with no education will decrease continuously and that by the end of this century virtually all people in the world will have received some level of education.

In the visualization below you also see that in 1970 there were only around 700 million people in the world that had secondary or post-secondary education. By the end of this century the number of people with secondary or post-secondary education will have increased 10-fold and will reach 7 billion people (a similar number as the world population today)!

<h3>Education of the World Population until 2050</h3>
The best available data suggests that we should see rates of education increasing as the world develops. By 2050, only five countries are predicted to have a rate of no education above 20%: these are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali and Niger. There is also expected to be a large increase in the numbers of people obtaining degrees, while more people complete secondary school.

<h3>The Developing World: A comparison between Brazil and Russia</h3>
Compare the projections for Brazil and Russia below. While both are considered developing economies, Russia is far more educated than Brazil at present. What is more, while the population of Brazil is projected to continue growing into the future, the population of Russia is predicted to decline. By 2050, almost every Russian is expected to have completed secondary school.

<h3>Methodology</h3>
Back projections of education rely on cross sectional data of the highest level of educational attainment for different segments of the population. The data used is taken from the UN and is only for the year 2000; the educational attainment series is projected backwards from this single year. The year 2000 was chosen as the base year since it had the widest coverage of countries available at the time. Throughout the back projection, no other data on education is used.

Using the life expectancy and education-specific period life expectancy for each cohort, the different survival ratios are computed. This survival ratio is then used to go back one period (5 years) according to the formula:

N\left(\mbox{age}-5,\mbox{educ},t-5,\mbox{sex}\right)=\dfrac{N\left(\mbox{age},\mbox{educ},t,\mbox{sex}\right)}{SR\left(\mbox{age}-5,\mbox{educ},t-5,\mbox{sex}\right)}

where [latex] N\left(.\right)[/latex] refers to the number of people in the group defined by [latex] \left(.\right)[/latex] and [latex] SR\left(.\right)[/latex] is the survival ratio for the group [latex] \left(.\right)[/latex]. The survival ratio accounts for both mortality and migration. Note that the model accounts for dependency of survival on education.

The projections of future education depend on the assumptions made and the IIASA produces estimates for different scenarios. The ones presented in this article are for the Global Education Trend (GET) scenario, where global education trends persist into the future. The other scenario data can be downloaded from their website.[ref]The four scenarios are:

Constant enrollment number (CEN)

Constant enrollment ratio (CER)

Global education trend (GET)

Fast-track (FT) [/ref] The methodology used to project future education trends is more sophisticated than for the back projections and so is omitted from this article.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<p>Much of this article here and of the measurement of materialism and post-materialism in general is based on a measure proposed by Ronald Inglehart in 1971.[ref]This highly cited (&gt;1200) article is Inglehart, Ronald 1971: The silent revolution in Europe. Intergenerational change in post-industrial societies. In: American Political Science Review 65 (4), 1971. Online <a href="http://costa.wustl.edu/teaching/IntroComp/Reading/inglehart1971.pdf">here</a> at the website of Washinton University St. Louis.</p>
<p>For a short overview of¬†the evolution and discussion of various measures of post-materialism, see section 2 of Oliver Hansen and Richard S. J. Tol (2003) ‚Äì¬†Refined Inglehart Index Of Materialism And Postmaterialism. Working Papers from Research unit Sustainability and Global Change, Hamburg University. Online <a href="http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/working-papers/inglehart.pdf">here</a>. [/ref]<br />
In this article he proposed the measure that is now called Inglehart's¬† Post-Materialist index (4-item).[ref]This is the name of the index in the <a href="http://www.wvsevsdb.com">World Value Survey</a>. [/ref]</p>
<p>The following survey question is the starting point for measuring materialism or post-materialism: "If you had to choose among the following things, which are the two that seem most desirable to you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining order in the nation.</li>
<li>Giving the people more say in important political decisions.</li>
<li>Fighting rising prices.</li>
<li>Protecting freedom of speech."</li>
</ul>
<p>The measure is then based on the consideration that two of the items ‚Äì the 1st and 3rd ‚Äì were regarded as indicating "'acquisitive value preferences' as they relate to the protection and acquisition of property." If the two post-materialist items are chosen the score is¬†3, if one post-materialist is chosen the score is 2, otherwise it is 1. As all of the choices might be desirable, the measure relates to the 'relative priority' of the materialistic choices over the 2nd and 4th policy goals and addresses the trade-offs that are typical for political choices. The conceptualization of post-materialism along a uni-dimensional continuum is close to the concept of the 'hierarchy of needs' proposed by Maslow. 'Inglehart‚Äôs theory of value change is one that assumes a linear progression in discrete steps upwards of Maslow‚Äôs pyramid'.[ref]Held, M., J. M√ºller, F. Deutsch, E. Grzechnik &amp; C. Welzel (2009). ‚ÄúValue Structure and Dimensions. Empirical Evidence from the German World Values Survey.‚Äù World Values Research 2(3):55-76. Online <a href="http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/paperseries_31/files/WVR_02_03_Held%20et%20al">here</a>.[/ref]</p>
<p>This very simple indicator was understandably only the starting point for measuring post-materialism. Inglehart himself proposed a more comprehensive 12-item measure.[ref]This measure is also included in the World Value Survey.<br />
The relevant literature is Inglehart, Ronald (1977) ‚Äì The silent revolution. Changing values and political styles among Western Publics. Princeton: Princeton University Press and Inglehart, Ronald (1990) ‚Äì Culture shift in advanced industrial society. Princeton: Princeton University Press.[/ref] A weakness of the 4-item indicator, according to Inglehart himself, was that it is ‚Äúexcessively sensitive to short-term forces‚Äù.</p>

More precisely, it is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country or region in a specific time period. While the definition of GDP is straightforward, accurately measuring it is a surprisingly difficult undertaking. Moreover, any attempts to make comparisons over time and across borders are complicated by price, quality and currency differences. This article covers the basics of GDP data and highlights many of the pitfalls associated with intertemporal and spatial comparisons.
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2>
There are many reasons why we might be interested in the size of an economy, its performance over time, or its relative performance compared to other countries. GDP is the most common way of measuring the size of an economy.

GDP is published in a country's National Accounts. These statistics comply to protocols laid down in the 1993 version of the Systems of National Accounts, SNA93.

The SNA93 established the 'production boundary', a crucial definition of what is and is not included in GDP figures:
<ul>
 	<li>included are all goods and services that are exchanged,</li>
 	<li>included are all goods that are not exchanged (for example food produced for home consumption)</li>
 	<li>but excluded are<em> services</em> that are not exchanged. Among these excluded services are food preparation, education of children at home, and minor home repairs.
<ul>
 	<li>An important exception to the services that are included is the housing services consumed by owner-occupiers. This service is imputed (imputed rent) and included in the GDP figure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>GDP per capita and average incomes</h3>

In principle there are three equivalent ways to calculate GDP:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Production</strong>: the value of final outputs produced in an economy less the value of all the inputs used in their production</li>
 	<li><strong>Expenditure</strong>: the expenditure on final goods and services produced in an economy by households, corporations and governments</li>
 	<li><strong>Income</strong>: the income earned by individuals and businesses from the production of goods and services in the economy</li>
</ol>
It theory these three measures should be equal; they constitute an accounting identity. A company's revenue is the income it generates from selling the goods and services it produces to consumers; yet that same revenue is also the expenditure of consumers on those goods and services. Paul Krugman makes the point that "our income mostly comes from selling things to each other. Your spending is my income, and my spending is your income."[ref]Paul Krugman. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/opinion/krugman-the-austerity-agenda.html">The Austerity Agenda</a>. The New York Times (2012).[/ref] This symmetry allows us to use GDP to approximate average incomes by dividing GDP by the total population. In reality, average incomes and GDP per capita will not be equal.[ref]There are many reasons why this is the case. One reason is due to the biases coming from the way GDP is defined. GDP does not include income earned abroad by the citizens of a country but includes domestic production by foreign companies (which may be used to pay shareholders abroad). Another issue is that the total population of a country will include both workers and those outside the labour force.[/ref]

<h3>Real GDP: adjusting for inflation in intertemporal comparisons</h3>
Nominal GDP is a measure of the value of output produced in a country or region over a specified period (usually one year). The value of output is composed of two factors: the volume produced and the price,
[latex]
\[GDP=P \times V,
\][/latex]
where [latex]P[/latex] represents the price of output and [latex]V[/latex] represents the volume of output. Therefore increases to GDP are either the result of more output, higher prices or a combination of the two. When looking at the performance of a single economy over time it is important that we control for price effects since they can mask changes to the value of output. In these cases we adjust for the price changes and look at real GDP. The real GDP is constructed by 'deflating' the nominal GDP by a price index that tracks changes to prices in the economy relative to a chosen base year. This transformation attempts to isolate volume changes by eliminating price effects.

However, it is not just prices that change over time. The very products and services that we produce and buy change. Technological progress has meant that the goods and services available today are invariably superior to those available several hundred years ago, with almost no example to the contrary. The introduction of new goods and services creates serious problems for intertemporal comparisons of wealth that are most relevant today; it is less of a problem for the long pre-modern world when almost all economic production consisted of¬†food, shelter and clothing. To emphasise this point consider the following example: In 1836 the richest man in the world was probably Nathan Rothschild. Rothschild could afford whatever he wanted - every good and service available in the world of 1836. Yet in that same year, the 56 year old died of an infection that is curable today by cheap antibiotics. [ref]Landes, David S. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.1969&rep=rep1&type=pdf">The wealth and poverty of nations: Why some are so rich and some so poor</a>. WW Norton &amp; Company, 1999.[/ref]
<h3>Quality changes</h3>
The Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi report explains "Quality change can be very rapid in areas like information and communication technologies. There are also products whose quality is complex, multi-dimensional and hard to measure, such as medical services, educational services, research activities and financial services. Difficulties also arise in 1. Evidence and references in support of the claims presented in this Summary are presented in a companion technical report. 22 SHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT collecting data in an era when an increasing fraction of sales take place over the internet and at sales as well as discount stores. As a consequence, capturing quality change correctly is a tremendous challenge for statisticians, yet this is vital to measuring real income and real consumption, some of the key determinants of people‚Äôs well-being. Under-estimating quality improvements is equivalent to over-estimating the rate of inflation, and therefore to underestimating real income. For instance, in the mid-1990s, a report reviewing the measurement of inflation in the United States (Boskin Commission Report) estimated that insufficient accounting for quality improvements in goods and services had led to an annual overestimation of inflation by 0.6%. This led to a series of changes to the US consumer price index."[ref]Stiglitz, Joseph, Sen, Amartya, &amp; Fitoussi, Jean-Paul (2009) ‚Äì <a href="http://www.insee.fr/fr/publications-et-services/dossiers_web/stiglitz/doc-commission/RAPPORT_anglais.pdf">Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress</a>.[/ref]

The two most common price indices used to deflate incomes and nominal GDP are:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong>: The basket is used measure the price changes of the goods and services consumed by the typical household. The typical household consumption basket will vary from country-to-country due to different preferences and income levels as well as over time as new technologies emerge and preferences change. CPI indices are produced by national statistical agencies, with one major exception being the European Union‚Äôs Harmonised CPI (HCPI). The HCPI uses consistent definitions for all Eurozone members to aid comparability.The CPI used to adjust household incomes tracks changes to the price of a basket of goods that the typical household purchases. It is measuring the price changes of <em>consumption</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>GDP deflator</strong>: The GDP deflator also called National Accounts deflator measures the purchasing power relative to the prices of all domestically produced final goods and services in an economy. It is measuring the price changes of domestic <em>production</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Differences between CPI and GDP deflator</h4>
The CPI index measures price changes of consumption whereas the GDP deflator measures price changes of domestic production.

Consequently there are several important differences of the two price indices:[ref]FrancÃßois Lequiller, Derek Blades (2006) ‚Äì <a href="http://www.oecd.org/std/UNA-2014.pdf">Understanding National Accounts, second edition</a>, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[/ref]
<ul>
 	<li>Unlike the CPI, the GDP deflator does not adjust for changes of goods that are imported from other countries and the price changes of import prices are not directly taken into account.</li>
 	<li>Secondly, the GDP deflator covers capital goods, goods that are not bought by consumers.</li>
 	<li>The CPI is also available monthly for most countries, while the GDP deflator is mostly available only quarterly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Composition of the bundle of goods and services measured in the CPI</h4>
The following chart displays the composition of the German CPI basket of goods. The basket used is chosen to reflect the expenditure of the typical household, and changes to the CPI index over time reflect changes to the prices the typical consumer will face. The typical household consumption basket will vary from country-to-country due to preferences as well as over time as new technologies emerge and preferences change.[ref]In 2012 the UK statistical agency changed the composition of this basket of goods to better reflect the typical consumption basket of households. Tablet computers were added demonstrating the effect of new technologies, while boiled sweets were removed reflecting changing preferences.

<h3>International GDP Comparisons: market vs. PPP exchange rates</h3>
In order to highlight the difficultly of making international comparisons between countries, consider the average income of somebody living in India compared with the US.

In 2011 the average Indian earned 72,000 rupees, while the average American earned $50,000. Since the average incomes are stated in different currencies, comparing the numerical value is meaningless and does not help us determine who is richer and by how much. Converting the rupee amount into US dollars using market exchange rates gives us an average income of $1,500 in India. This number is over 33 times smaller than the income of the average American!

However, it is obvious that the cost of living in the US is much higher than in India, which implies that the comparison of incomes made at market exchange rates is also not a fair comparison of how rich or poor the people really are in comparison.[ref]The fact that the income ratio between a high and low income country is systematically exaggerated by GDP conversion at the market exchange rates is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_effect">Penn Effect</a>.[/ref] A solution is to convert the amounts using the <em>Purchasing Power Parity</em> (PPP) exchange rate. This conversion takes into account differences in the price levels of both countries. Making the PPP-adjustment reveals that the average income of someone living in India is $4,800 (international dollars), only 10 times smaller than in the US. The precise nature of PPP adjustments is explained in the section below.

This does not mean that comparisons of GDP evaluated at market exchange rates are uninformative. In fact, when comparing financial flows, PPP-adjustments are meaningless and GDP evaluated at the market exchange rate is the most appropriate measure. When comparing development and living standards, the converse is true since we need to eliminate price effects.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ourworldindata_gdp-ppp-per-capita.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6139" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ourworldindata_gdp-ppp-per-capita-750x524.png" alt="PPP-adjusted GDP per capita in India and the US" width="750" height="524" /></a>
<h3>PPP-adjusted GDP: spatial comparisons</h3>
GDP comparisons made using market exchange rates fail to reflect differences in the purchasing power of different currencies. In general, prices are higher in developed economies,[ref]This fact is explained by the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balassa%E2%80%93Samuelson_effect">Balassa‚ÄìSamuelson effect</a>.[/ref] and so exchange rate adjusted GDP measures will underestimate the size of low income economies.

In a simplified world, the prices of traded goods are determined by global demand and supply forces, while the prices of non-traded goods are determined by local demand and supply forces. Since wages and salaries are lower in developing countries, the prices of non-traded goods also tend to be lower. This feature is missed by exchange rate adjusted GDP calculations as no distinction is made between traded and non-traded goods. In a world where all goods are traded, exchange rate adjusted GDP would be a more informative way to make international comparisons. Nevertheless, another complicating factor is that exchange rates are highly volatile and determined by currency speculation, interest rates and international capital flows.

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustments to GDP are an attempt to isolate differences in the volume of output of two economies. That is, they eliminate disparities in the price levels of different economies. A PPP exchange rate can be thought of as the cost ratio of a comparable (but not identical) basket of goods in two countries. Hence, the methodology is analogous to that used in computing CPI inflation to calculate real GDP, except that here the comparisons are made between countries rather than over time. More precisely, PPP-adjusted GDP is a spatial measure and not a temporal one like real GDP: a base country is used as opposed to a base year. The US dollar is the most common unit of currency used to make international comparisons and, for clarity, PPP-adjusted quantities are quoted in international or Geary-Khamis dollars.[ref] Roy C. Geary and Salem Hanna Khamis were economic statisticians that proposed this approach for comparisons.[/ref]

We can decompose the GDP ratio of two economies into[latex]
\[
\frac{GDP_{A}}{GDP_{B}}=\frac{P_{A}}{P_{B}}\times\frac{C_{A}}{C_{B}}\times\frac{V_{A}}{V_{B}},
\][/latex]
where [latex]P_{X}[/latex] is the price level in country [latex]X[/latex], [latex]C_{X}[/latex] is the currency level in country [latex]X[/latex], and [latex]V_{X}[/latex] is the volume of output (real output) in country [latex]X[/latex]. When making international comparisons we are interested in the ratio of output volume. It is possible to remove the currency differences by using the exchange rate to convert the GDP into a common currency, but this would leave price level differences. The PPP exchange rate adjusts for both the currency and the price level ratio.
<h4>The creation of PPPs by the International Comparisons Programme (ICP)</h4>
The PPPs that are used in international comparisons today are created by the International Comparisons Programme (ICP) conducted by the World Bank. The latest round of the ICP was completed in 2014 and has estimated PPPs for 2011. The study covers 199 countries and is the most extensive study of PPPs ever conducted.

Since the research is highly intensive and requires cooperation with many different countries and statistical agencies, the existing PPP data is sparse (8 benchmark years since the first ICP study in 1970). What is more, the methodology used and the group of participating countries has differed between each round of the ICP. There are six years separating the most recent ICP estimates (2011 and 2005). Her is a <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPINT/Resources/270056-1183395201801/Summary-of-Results-and-Findings-of-the-2011-International-Comparison-Program.pdf" target="_blank">detailed explanation of the methodology and findings of the 2011 ICP</a>.

<h4>Computing PPP-adjusted GDP for years for which no ICP data is available</h4>

Computing PPP-adjusted GDP for years where ICP data is available is straightforward, however, in years where there is no data, there is no consensus regarding the best way to produce estimates.

Since PPP is a spatial measure, each ICP estimate is indexed to a benchmark year. Producing PPP-adjusted GDP estimates for non-benchmark years requires either extrapolation of PPP-estimates from a single round of ICP data, interpolation between different rounds or a combination of the two. Extrapolation takes the PPP-adjusted GDP in a single year and assumes that it evolves according to real GDP growth rates or the inflation ratio of the country of interest with the US. Interpolation attempts to "fill-in the gaps" using observed ICP rounds in conjunction with inflation or growth data according to some statistical model. The two figures presented below are designed to aid understanding of these two methods.

Understanding the methodology and purpose of each dataset is important when conducting data analysis. The four most important data sets for PPP-adjusted GDP data have the following methodology:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>World Bank data</strong>: Extrapolates from the most recent ICP round using national accounts deflators. The data and a brief description of the methodology can be found at <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PRVT.PP" target="_blank">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PRVT.PP</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>Since the data is extrapolated from the 2011 ICP, data is only presented for the years 1990-2014 as any further extrapolation is likely to give unreliable estimates. This dataset is most useful when considering the very recent past as the 2011 ICP round uses the most sophisticated methodology to date. It also has the advantage of being extrapolated forward in time to 2014.</li>
 	<li>Notes from the documentation: "For most economies PPP figures are extrapolated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) benchmark estimates or imputed using a statistical model based on the 2011 ICP."</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Penn World Tables</strong>: Interpolates and extrapolates using national accounts deflators. The methodology used can be found in the documentation available at <a href="http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/pwt-8.1" target="_blank">http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/pwt-8.1</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>This dataset is most commonly used for statistical analysis by economists and covers the years 1950-2011. It is arguably the most reliable, long-run data available on PPP-adjusted GDP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Gapminder</strong>: Interpolates and extrapolates using real growth rates. The <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdoc001_v9.pdf" target="_blank">methodology used can be found in the documentation</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>Gapminder aims to give the widest coverage possible at the expense of robust estimates. Much of the historic data has been estimated from trends and other For this reason, we present the data here for the purposes of graphical presentation and not as fact.</li>
 	<li>Notes from the documentation: "The main purpose of the data is to produce graphical presentations that display the magnitude of income disparities in the world over time... Hence we discourage the use of this data set for statistical analysis... The observations for the period before 1950 are, in the majority of cases, based on rough estimates within a range of likely values. In many cases we have no information, what-so-ever, on the relative ranking of countries."</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Maddison Project</strong>: Data is drawn from various sources. A complete list of sources can be found in the documentation available at <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>This dataset has many different sources and is curated by the project team. Although the long-run data is much less reliable than more recent estimates, the more rigorous nature of the estimates allows for better spatial comparisons.</li>
 	<li>Notes from the documentation: "The Maddison Project database places the emphasis more on the international comparability of the estimates than on their consistency over time."</li>
