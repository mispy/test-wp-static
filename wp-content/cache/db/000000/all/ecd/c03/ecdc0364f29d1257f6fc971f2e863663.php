This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/">Energy Production &amp; Changing Energy Sources</a>.</div>
Discussions about energy and electricity can be confusing. Often, the root of this confusion lies in the choice of units and scale. Firstly, units are often quoted inconsistently: we switch between watt-hours, kilograms of oil equivalent, joules, and even more confusingly, units of power. Secondly, we begin quoting big numbers in the order of millions and billions without a sense of scale: is the unit equivalent to one, ten, or one hundred coal-fired power stations? Thirdly, we lose perspective on the equivalence between electrical energy production and consumption: how many people could a wind or solar farm provide for?

To make our full data entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/">Energy Production &amp; Changing Energy Sources</a>Â as useful and clear as possible, we have standardized all of our energy data into a single energy unit: the watt-hour (Wh). The only variation on the watt-hour which we have used is in scaling large numbers into kilowatt, megawatt or gigawatt-hours (which are one thousand, million, and billion watt-hours, respectively). The base unit of the watt-hour, however, remains consistent. This should help to reduce confusion for the first of the three reasons described above.

To address the latter two challenges we have produced the chart shown below, which aims to provide a sense of scale for both electricity production and consumption [<strong>clicking on this chart offers a pop-out version, for which some finer aspects can be more easily read</strong>]. It is comprised of two scales: electricity production and electricity consumption. On the left-hand side we have a chart which extends from zero up to 100,000 MWh. The individual arrows represent the daily electrical outputs of different plant types; as we see, there is a large range of outputs depending on the size and conditions of the specific facility. The average daily output of specific power plants (some of which you may recognize) are shown and labelled as individual stars.

The labeled horizontal lines on these charts aim to give a sense of perspective on electricity consumption levels across the world. For example, in the chart below a very large hydro or nuclear plant could produce enough electricity to meet the demands of 100 million people in Ghana; a large hydro, nuclear, or coal plant could provide for 10 million average global citizens, and average-sized plant would meet demands of ten million in Brazil.

The left-hand chart is dominated by hydropower, nuclear, coal and geothermal production. The output of onshore and offshore wind, and solar photovoltaic (PV) farms currently lie below 10,000 MWh per day, which you see at the bottom of the left-hand chart. The right-hand chart provides a magnification of the bottom section of this chart, extending only from zero to 10,000 MWh. Just as in the left-hand chart, the range of daily electricity outputs from wind and solar PV farms are shown by the arrows, with specific farms represented by stars. Again, we have provided a sense of perspective on how this relates to electricity consumption needs across a range of countries using the labeled horizontal lines.

The data used in these charts are not perfect; we have attempted to provide a global-level overview of a range of electrical energy production sources and average levels of consumption across countries. These figures are based on a number of assumptions and calculations which are explained in detail below. Despite these limitations, we hope these charts are of value in providing an overall sense of scale for both production and consumption.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15070" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01.png" alt="" width="12976" height="9676" /></a>
<h2>Data sources for electrical energy production and consumption chart</h2>
Explanation of the assumptions and calculations involved in the derivation of the figures used in the charts above are detailed below.
<h3>Electrical energy production</h3>
Figures on the daily output from different electricity sources have been derived in one of two ways:
<ul>
 	<li>Where specific reported details on the annual energy output of a plant or facility have been published, we have converted this to a daily average output in watt-hours or megawatt-hours.</li>
 	<li>Where specific details on electrical output are not available, we have calculated this based on a plant's maximum power rating and the average capacity factor for a plant of its type, based on capacity factor data published by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)[ref]U.S. Energy Information Administration. Electric Power Annual 2009 (Updated in 2011). Available <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/archive/03482009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref] (described below).</li>
</ul>
The output of electric power facilities are often described in terms of their maximum capacity; this is a metric of power (not energy), measured in watts (W). There are two conversions we need to make to this metric to derive the average electrical energy daily output. First, we have to convert power into energy. Energy is a measure of power output over time (energy = power x time). So to calculate energy output in watt-hours we have to multiply our power rating by the number of hours our plant is running. For example, if we have a 1000MW plant, its maximum energy output in a day would be 24,000MWh (1000MW x 24 hours).

However, this assumes that a plant runs continuously at maximum output, which most (if not all) don't. The second correction we have to make is to multiply this output by its capacity factor. The capacity factor is defined as the actual electrical energy output as a percentage or ratio of the maximum possible output over a given time period. For example, if our plant only operates at 80% (through a combination of shut-down episodes and periods of operating below maximum capacity), our daily energy production would only be 19,200MWh per day (24,000MWh x 80%).

<strong>How much electricity does a hydropower plant produce in a day?</strong>

Hydropower production is unique from the perspective that it covers the largest range of electrical energy outputs; ranging from the largest production facilities in the world, down to so-called "<a href="https://energypedia.info/wiki/Pico_Hydro_Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pico hydro</a>" schemesâ€”simple water turbines which are often installed for a single household or cluster of households. xThese typically have a power rating of less than 5kW, producing less than one MWh per day (only about <a href="https://www.renewablesfirst.co.uk/hydropower/hydropower-learning-centre/how-much-energy-could-i-generate-from-a-hydro-turbine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 MWh per year</a>).

A collection of the world's largest hydro stations can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Brazil's Itaipu Dam, and China's Three Gorges Damâ€”the two largest electricity producers in the worldâ€”are key outliers with regards to output, producing almost double that of the third largest hydro facility. These two sites are represented as stars, with Itaipu Dam producing a daily average of 282,000 MWh (103 TWh per year/365 days), and the Three Gorges Dam produced an average of 270,000 MWh per day in 2014 (98.8 TWh/365). The other single hydro site shown in this chart is the USA's Hoover Dam, which produced a daily average of 11,000 MWh in 2014 (4 TWh/365).[ref]United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). Hoover Dam - Frequently asked questions. Available <a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/powerfaq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref]

Aside from the hydro outliers of the Itaipu and Three Gorges Dam, the cluster of the largest hydropower facilities achieve an annual output between 50-55 TWh. As a daily average (although seasonal variability will inevitably influence daily outputs throughout the year), large hydropower facilities produce approximately 150,000 MWh per day.

<strong>How much electricity does a nuclear plant produce in a day?</strong>

Output from nuclear power stations is typically more stable over time than output from hydropower or other renewable resources because they are less influenced by seasonal or environmental variations. To estimate the range of typical daily outputs from nuclear stations, we have utilized the reported maximum capacity of specific stations listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>Â with the average capacity factor of nuclear power, which is approximately 90%.[ref]U.S. Energy Information Administration. Electric Power Annual 2009 (Updated in 2011). Available <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/archive/03482009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref]

For example, the world's largest operating nuclear station is Canada's Bruce station, with a maximum capacity of 6,384 MW. The estimated average daily output is therefore calculated as 6,384 MW x 90% x 24 hours, which gives us approximately 138,000 MWh per day. The average daily output of the other nuclear stations highlighted here have been calculated using exactly the same methodology.

Small nuclear stations have a maximum capacity of around 400 MW, but can be as small as 200-250 MW. Reactors at India's Kaiga Atomic Power Station, for example, have a maximum capacity of 220 MW. As a result, the Kaiga Atomic facility produces on average 6100 MWh per day.

<strong>How much electricity does a coal plant produce in a day?</strong>

Like nuclear, our estimates of daily electrical output from coal-fired power stations have been calculated based on reported maximum capacity figures, found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coal_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>,Â and an average capacity factor of 64%.[ref]U.S. Energy Information Administration. Electric Power Annual 2009 (Updated in 2011). Available <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/archive/03482009.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref] The largest operating coal plant in the world is the Tiachung Power Plant in Taiwan; with a maximum capacity of 5500 MW, average daily output would be approximately 85,000 MWh (5,500MW * 64% * 24 hours).

Like nuclear production, small coal-fired plants can have a maximum capacity as low as hundreds of MW. The Kahone Thermal Power Station in Senegal, for example, has a capacity of only 102 MW. If we assume an average capacity factor of around 64%, daily output for coal can be as low as 1600 MWh per day.

<strong>How much electricity does a geothermal plant produce in a day?</strong>

The capacity and production of geothermal energy tends to be lower than that of hydro, nuclear and coal-powered stations. The largest geothermal producer in the world is The Geysers site in the USA; with a capacity of 1,517 MW and reported capacity factor of 63%, we calculate estimated daily output to be approximately 23,000 MWh.[ref]Ronald DiPippo (2008).Â <i>Geothermal Power Plants: Principles, Applications, Case Studies and Environmental Impact</i>. Elsevier Science &amp; Technology. Available <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YsSN8gdqKWEC">online</a>.[/ref]

However, if we look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geothermal_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of geothermal plants</a> across the world, The Geysers site is a large outlier in terms of potential output. The second largest geothermal plant has roughly half the installed capacity as The Geysers. If we take its installed capacity of 820 MW and assume Bloomberg New Energy Finance's global average capacity factor for geothermal of 73%, we approximate a typical large geothermal plant to produce roughly 14,000-15,000 MWh per day. Like hydropower, geothermal sites can also exist at a very small-scale; Italy's San Martino geothermal site has a capacity of only 40 MW; if we assume an average capacity factor of 73% for geothermal, average daily output would be around 700 MWh.

<strong>How much electricity does an onshore wind farm produce in a day?</strong>

Whilst the majority of onshore wind farms produce less than 10,000 MWh per day on average, the Gansu Wind Farm in China is a notable outlier. With an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu_Wind_Farm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed capacity</a> of 7,965 MW and average capacity factor of 12.4% for wind power in the Gansu region, we estimate daily output to be around 24,000 MWh.[ref]The case of wind production in the Gansu region is interesting. Although the capacity factor of renewables tend to be lower than fossil fuel and nuclear sources, 12.4% is particularly low for wind energy. The US IEA quote a range of capacity factors from 20-40%. Also notable is that wind generation in this region is highly underutilized. In 2016, 43% of wind capacity in the Gansu region was wasted.<em> Chinese National Energy Board. 2016 Wind Power Grid Operation. Available <a href="http://www.nea.gov.cn/2017-01/26/c_136014615.htm">online</a>.</em>[/ref]

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_onshore_wind_farms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next largest</a> wind farms are significantly smaller than Gansu Wind Farmâ€”Muppandal Wind Farm in India and Alta Wind Energy Centre in the USA have a maximum capacity of 1500 MW and 1320 MW, respectively. With a capacity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factor of 30%</a> versus the average factor in India of 15%, the Alta Wind Energy Centre produces an average of 7,342 MWh per day versus 5,400 MWh at Muppandal.[ref]Due to poor availability of local capacity factors for wind generation, we have had to assume the factor at Muppandal is similar to the Indian average of 15%. Power System Operation Corporation. SRLDC System Operation Report, March 2015. Available <a href="http://www.srldc.org/var/ftp/reports/monthlyrep/2014-15/Mar-month.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref]

Wind farms can be very small in size and capacity, down to the range of tens of megawatts. With a maximum capacity of only 11 MW, for example, Utgrunden Wind Farm in Sweden is likely to produce on average around 80 MWh per day.

<strong>How much electricity does an offshore wind farm produce in a day?</strong>

Although offshore wind farms can often achieve a higher capacity factor than onshore equivalents, their total installed capacity is yet to reach the scale of the largest onshore farms. The largest offshore wind farm to date is the UK's London Array. With a capacity of 630 MW and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Array#cite_note-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacity factor in 2015</a> of 45.3%, average daily output approximates to 6,800 MWh.

Similarly to onshore wind, offshore wind farms can be small in sizeâ€”some below 10 MW of installed capacity. Mt Stuart Wind Farm in New Zealand, for example, produces a daily average of only 70 MWh.

<strong>How much electricity does a solar photovoltaic (PV) farm produce in a day?</strong>

As discussed by David MacKay in his book "Sustainable Energy - without the hot air" (<a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/Contents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free here</a>), the electrical energy production per unit area of solar paneling is almost directly proportional to the amount of sunlight that falls upon it.[ref]David JC MacKay. Sustainable Energy - without the hot air". Available free <a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/Contents.html">online</a>.[/ref] As a result, optimal locations for solar energy, especially at low latitudes can achieve an energy output 2-3 times higher than at very high latitudes. However, as this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photovoltaic_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of the largest solar PV farms</a> shows, solar can deliver a reasonable output across most countries, regardless of latitude.

The largest solar PV farm to date is China's Tengger Desert Solar Park, with an installed capacity of 1,500 MW. If we assume a capacity factor of 20% (which is high for solar, but not unreasonable), daily output would be approximately 7,200 MWh. California's Topaz Solar Farm has an installed capacity about one-third of China's Tengger, but with a high capacity factor of 24.4% achieves an average daily output of 3,466 MWh.

Like onshore and offshore wind, solar PV farms can be as small as tens of megawatt hours per day. Iran's largest PV park, Jarqavieh has only 10 MW capacity, and produces an average of 48 MWh (assuming a 20% capacity factor) daily.
<h3>Electricity consumption</h3>
The figures on electricity consumption (represented as horizontal lines on the chart above) are based on figures presented in our below chart onÂ per capita electricity.Â We have used World Bank estimates of annual per capita electrical power consumption in 2014, by first calculating <em>daily</em> per capita use (by dividing annual figures by 365), and using multipliers of 10 million; one million; and 100,000 to calculate the total daily electricity consumption of a given number of citizens across a range of countries.

As the focus is on international comparisons I have made sure to list all the metrics and datasets that are included in the World Bank's extensive <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats">EdStats</a> data catalogue. With all the many measures on attainment and enrollment, in gross and net rates, ISCED levels, etc. etc. it can be difficult to understand what education data actually refers to. I hope this document is useful as a reference for some.


All the definitions of education metrics below are based on the helpfulÂ <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary">glossary</a> of the UNESCO and the definitions include a direct link to the definition in that glossary with more details.
<h3>General</h3>
A general difficulty in educational data is to find a good measure to express the share of children that are taken into, enrolled, or attending educational institutions. The difficulty here is that several options for the considered age-bracket of children are possible as both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio â€“ each possibility comes with difficulties and advantages. The main difference here is to distinguish between <strong>theÂ gross and the net rate:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Gross rates</strong> take into account all children at a given level of education regardless of their age and relate these to the population of the age group which officially corresponds to that level of education.
<ul>
 	<li>The advantage is that the numerator includes all children at the particular level of education. The downside is that there cannot be a corresponding denominator. One option would be to express it relative to the entire population (which is sometimes done for tertiary education), but an often more informative â€“ albeit not perfect option â€“ is to express it relative to the population in the official age-bracket for that level of education.Â For this reason gross rates can exceed 100%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Net rates</strong> only take into account those children who are in the official age group for a given level of education in both the numerator and denominator.
<ul>
 	<li>The advantage of net rates is that children within the same age bracket are compared and it is therefore not possible that the net rate exceeds 100%. The disadvantage is that not all children in a particular level of education are considered in net rates â€“ those that are older or younger than the official age group are not considered in this measure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gross-vs-net-enrollment-rate-in-primary-education">Here</a> is a scatterplot of the gross vs the net enrollment rate in primary education.

&nbsp;
<h3>Intake</h3>
The intake of students into the educational system can be measured as the absolute number of students (for example by a measure such as "New entrants to grade 1 in primary (in absolute numbers)"). However to compare intake across countries and over time intake <em>rates</em> are more informative. Several intake rates are commonly used:
<h4>Intake rate</h4>
The<strong> net intake ratio to grade 1 of primary education</strong> =Â total number of new entrants in Grade 1 of primary education who are of the official primary school-entrance age / the population of the same age.

The <strong>gross intake ratio to grade 1 of primary education</strong> =Â total number of new entrants in Grade 1 of primary education, regardless of their age / the population at the official primary school entrance age.

</ul>
TheÂ <strong>expected gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education</strong> =Â total number of new entrants to the first grade of primary in a given year, regardless of age, who are expected to reach the last grade of primary education, regardless of repetition / the population at the official entrance age to primary education in the same year.

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Enrollment</h3>
Enrollment figures, by level of education, are published in absolute numbers, but for comparisons between countries and over time enrollment <em>rates</em> are again more commonly used.

The difference between the various enrollment rates listed above are which age groups are measured in the numerator and denominator of the ratio. There are are additional measures that specifically look at the enrollment of over-age and under-age children such as the: "over-age enrollment ratio in primary education" or the "percentage of students enrolled in primary education who are over-age" (and the same metrics are published for "under-age" children).
<h4>Enrollment rate</h4>
Enrollment rates â€“ also "enrollment ratios" â€“ are available not only by level of education (primary, secondary, tertiary), but also be grade (grade 1 of primary, grade 2 of primary, etc.). They are often disaggregated by sex and socioeconomic background of the parents.

The<strong> net enrollmentÂ rate =</strong>Â students enrolled who are of the official age group for a given level of education / the population for the same age group.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/net-enrolment-rate">Net enrollment rate definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
The<strong> gross enrollmentÂ rate = </strong>number ofÂ students enrolled in a given level of education (regardless of their age) / the population of the age group which officially corresponds to the given level of education.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/gross-enrolment-ratio">Gross enrollment rate definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
 	<li>Since the numerator and denominator are referring to the population in different age groups it is possible that the gross enrollment rate exceeds 100%.</li>
</ul>
The <strong>adjusted net enrollment rate =Â </strong>number ofÂ students of the official primary school age group who are enrolled at primary or secondary education / the populationÂ of the official primary school age group.

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Attendance</h3>
Attendance rates are available by level of education (primary, secondary, tertiary or more levels of detail), by sex, rural-vs-urban location, and parental socioeconomic background.

The <strong>net attendance rate</strong> = total number of students in the theoretical age group for a given level of education attending that level at any time during the reference academic year / total population in that age group.

<h3>Out-of-school</h3>
Data on the <strong>number of out-of-school</strong> <strong>children</strong> (primary school age) and <strong>out-of-school</strong> <strong>adolescents</strong> (secondary school age) are published. For comparisons drop-out <em>rates</em> are often more informative.

The data onÂ out-of-school children (of primary school age) and of adolescents (of secondary school age) is also broken down by <strong>"typology" of out-of-school children</strong> to differentiate between those who never attended school, those who dropped out, and those who are currently out of school, but are expected to enter the education system later than they should ("late entry").

&nbsp;
<h3>Drop-out</h3>
The <strong>drop-out-rate (by grade)</strong> is the share ofÂ pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who are no longer enrolled in the following school year.
<ul>
 	<li>It is the share of children who are neither promoted to the next grade nor have to repeat the same grade again and it is therefore calculated as follows: <strong>drop-out-rate</strong> = 100% â€“ (promotion rate + repetition rate)</li>
 	<li><strong>Drop-out-rates</strong>Â are published for different levels of education as cumulative drop-out-rates and also for specific grades within a particular level of education.</li>

Promotion refers to the progression from one <em>grade</em> to the next while transition refers to the promotion from one <em>level</em> of education to the next (primary to secondary or secondary to tertiary).

The <strong>promotion rate (by grade)</strong> =Â number of new enrollment in a given grade in the following school year / number of students from the same cohort enrolled in the preceding grade in the previous school year
<ul>
 	<li>The promotion rate measures the shareÂ of students from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who study in the next grade in the following school year.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/promotion-rate-grade">The promotion rate by grade definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
TheÂ <strong>effective promotion rate (by grade)</strong> =Â number of new entrants to the following grade for the following year / number of students enrolled in the previous grade in the given year without the number of repeaters at that previous grade in that following year.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/effective-promotion-rate-grade">The effective promotion rate by grade definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Transition</h3>
Transition rates are published for transitions between different levels of education (primary to secondary, secondary to tertiary).

The <strong>transition rate</strong> = number of students admitted to the first grade of the next higher level of education in a given year / number of students enrolled in the final grade of the lower level of education in the previous year.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/transition-rate">The transition rate definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
The <strong>effective transition rate</strong> =Â number of new entrants to the first grade of the higher level of education in the following year / students enrolled in the last grade of the given level of education in the given year who do not repeat that grade the following year
<ul>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Survival</h3>
Survival rates are published for example as theÂ 'survival rate to the last grade of primary education' or as the 'survival rate to grade 4 of primary education'.

The <strong>survival rate</strong> (to a particular grade at a specific level of education) =Â total number of students belonging to a school-cohort who reached each successive grade of the specified level of education / the number of students in the school-cohort (i.e. those originally enrolled in the first grade of the specified level of education)
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/survival-rate-grade">The survival rate by grade definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Repeating</h3>
A repeater is a student whoÂ is enrolled in the same grade for more than one year.Â Data on repeaters is also available in absolute numbers , broken down by sex, and by specific grade in the education system (grade 1 in primary education, grade 2 in primary education, etc.).

The <strong>repetition rate</strong>Â (by grade) =Â number of repeaters in a given grade in the following school year / the number of pupils from the same cohort enrolled in the same grade in the previous school year
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/repetition-rate-grade">The repetition by grade definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
 	<li>Also calculated is the<strong> percentage of repeaters at a specific level of education</strong>. For example the percentage of repeaters at primary school level is the total number of students in primary school enrolled in the same grade as in the previous year, expressed as a percentage of all students enrolled in primary school.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>School life expectancy</h3>
The school life expectancy (SLE) is the number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend at a specific level of education (such as primary, secondary, and tertiary).

The World Bank explains: "For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates."

Regarding the interpretation the World Bank explains: "A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school. Those children who are in school may benefit from many more years of education than the average."

&nbsp;
<h3>Completion</h3>
Completion rates are published by level of education (primary, secondary, tertiary).

There are slightly different definitions of the <strong>completion rate</strong> used by different organizations. The UNESCO <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/completion-rate">defines</a> the completion rate as follows: "Percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade. The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age at which pupils would enter the grade if they had started school at the official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed without repeating or skipping a grade."

Other organizations however publish completion rates regardless of the children's age relative to the intended age.

The completion rate can exceed 100% due to repeaters and over- and under-aged children who enter the specific level of school late or early.

TheÂ <strong>cohort completion rate</strong> for a specific level of education =Â survival rate to the last grade of primary education * (number of graduates from the specific level of education in a given year / difference between enrolment in the last grade in the same year and repeaters in the last grade in the following year)
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/cohort-completion-rate-primary-education">The cohort completion rate definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Graduation</h3>
The <strong>gross graduation ratio</strong> =Â number of graduates regardless of age in a given level or programme / population at the theoretical graduation age for that level or programme
<ul>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>Educational attainment</h2>
In contrast to the previous metrics, educational attainment metrics are used to measure the level of education across the population older than the population that is still in the educational system.

Attainment is often further broken down by sex, age group, and also nationality, race, socioeconomic status, and also socioeconomic background of the parents.
<h4>Mean Years of Schooling</h4>
Mean years of schooling are the average number of completed years of education of a country's population. Grades that were repeated are mostly excluded.

The measure commonly refers to the population older than 15 or 25 years. The younger population is excluded because a large fraction of these is often still attending educational institutions at that age.

Mean years of schooling is often additionally disaggregated by mean years of schooling by type of schooling (primary, secondary, and tertiary).

Data on mean years of schooling is published in several sources:
<ul>
 	<li>Clio-Infra publishes estimates for countries around the world from the year 1860 to 2010.</li>
 	<li>IIASA-WC publishes projections until the year 2100. [available via the World Bank's EdStats.]</li>
 	<li>Barro &amp; Lee publish data from .Â [available via the World Bank's EdStats.]</li>
 	<li>UNESCO Institute for Statistics ("UIS").Â [available via the World Bank's EdStats.]</li>
</ul>
<h4>Population by highest level of education</h4>
A second way to measure the educational attainment is to focus on the highest level of education a particular individual attended. It is either expressed as the the absolute number or the share of the population with a particular level of education.

Data sources: Available from IIASA-WC, Barrro &amp; Lee, and UNESCO Institute for Statistics ("UIS").

<h2>Levels of education</h2>
The broad categories of primary, secondary, and tertiary education apply in most countries, but the specifics are very different from country to country. Because educational systems differ substantially between countries it is difficult to compare the level of educational attainment between different countries. This is why it became necessary to harmonize the levels of education in a standardized system that can be applied to every country. To make education statistics comparable across countries, the UNESCO designed the <strong><em>International Standard Classification of Education</em> (ISCED)Â </strong>shown in the table below.

The UNESCO published the ISCED classification information in <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf">this document</a>. The ISCED mappings for each country are <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/isced-mappings">published here</a>.
<h6>The 8 levels of theÂ International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)[ref]This table is taken from the Wikipedia entry on ISCED <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Education">here</a>.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-28-at-14.27.58.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13633" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-28-at-14.27.58-750x452.png" alt="" width="750" height="452" /></a>
<h3>Measures specific to early childhood education</h3>
New entrants to Grade 1 of primary education with early childhood education experience.

&nbsp;
<h3>Measures specific to secondary education</h3>
The <em>UNESCO Institute for Statistics</em> differentiates between <strong>vocational and general education</strong> on the secondary level of education.

<strong>Vocational education</strong> is described as follow: <em>"Vocational education is designed for learners to acquire the knowledge, skills and competencies specific to a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades. Vocational education may have work-based components (e.g. apprenticeships). Successful completion of such programmes leads to labour-market relevant vocational qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labour market."</em>

<strong>General education</strong> at the secondary school level is described as: <em>"General education is designed to develop learnersâ€™ general knowledge, skills and competencies and literacy and numeracy skills, often to prepare students for more advanced educational programmes at the same or higher ISCED levels and to lay the foundation for lifelong learning. General educational programmes are typically school- or college-based. General education includes educational programmes that are designed to prepare students for entry into vocational education, but that do not prepare for employment in a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades, nor lead directly to a labour market relevant qualification."</em>

Level 4 on the ISCED classification is referred to as <strong>"post-secondary non-tertiary education"</strong>. According to the <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf">UNESCO classification</a>, education at this level "provides learning experiences building on secondary education, preparing for labour market entry as well as tertiary education", but the content of such a program "is not sufficiently complex to be regarded as tertiary education, although it is clearly post-secondary".
<h3>Measures specific to tertiary education</h3>
Because the age group of students in tertiary education varies more than for primary or secondary education it is common to publish the ratio of students enrolled in tertiary education relative to the entire population, for example the <strong>ratio between students in tertiary educationÂ per 100,000 inhabitants</strong>.

Instead of statistics on particular grades it is common in international educational statistics on tertiary education to refer to the ISCED levels 5, 6, and 7.

Because of the specialization of education at this level it is common to publish statistics on particular specializations. These are standardized by the UNESCO across countries in theÂ International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)Â fields of tertiary education. The following table shows this classification which comprises 25 narrow fields of education which fall into 9 broader groups.
<h6>The classification of fields of tertiary education according to the UNESCO's <em>International Standard Classification of Education</em> (ISCED)[ref]This table is taken from theÂ OECD publication "Education Indicators in Focus" (February 2014) online <a href="https://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/EDIF%202014--No19.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]</h6>

<h2>Measures on Learning Outcomes</h2>
All data discussed is concerned with inputs in the education system â€“ ultimately it is about how much time students spend in educational institutions. For educational inputs we have pretty complete data coverage, both, in time and space. But the goal of going to school is of course to learn and on this aspect â€“ the learning outcomes of education â€“ data is much sparser. Efforts to measure these outcomes are geographically more restricted (often only OECD countries are included) and even less is known about how the performance of students with respect to these outcomes has changed over time. A third limitation is that measures are sometimes not comparable between countries. 

Most often these assessment are measuring learning outcomes of one or several of the following three dimensions:
<ul>
 	<li>Reading and language proficiency</li>
 	<li>Mathematics and numeracy proficiency</li>
 	<li>Scientific knowledge and understanding</li>
</ul>
Scores are published broken down by sex and sometimes by socioeconomic background.

The assessments differ in respect to how children are selected. While some assessments select children by their age, there are other assessments which select children by the school grade the child attends. The aim of these studies is to testÂ a representative random sample of the intended population.

The most widely available metric on the outcomes of education is literacy. The data on this very basic educational skill is briefly discussed below and in much more detail in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/">our entry on the topic</a>.

A detailed discussion of the assessment of learning outcomes is provided by Daniel Koretz in his bookÂ <em>Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us.</em>[ref]DanielÂ Koretz (2008) â€“ <em>Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us</em>. Harvard University Press. <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035218&amp;content=reviews">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035218&amp;content=reviews</a>[/ref]
<h4>PISA â€“Â The Programme for International Student Assessment</h4>
&nbsp;

The PISA assessment, which is coordinated by the OECD, is the most well known international assessment of learning outcomes. The first PISA study was carried out in 1997 and since then it was repeated every three years.

The study is not select students by grade, but by age and only tests 15-year-olds, whatever their school level. In a two-hour assessment the competencies in reading, mathematics and science of these students are assessed. It is a very substantial undertaking and until 2017 "half a million students representing 28 million 15-year-olds in 72 countries and economies have participated in PISA" <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/">according to the OECD</a>. The coverage of PISA can be seen in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-reading-scale">this map</a> on the results in the reading dimension, it obviously includes the richer OECD countries and unfortunately only few poorer countries. Poorer countries are also not tested regularly and were only participating in one round only and additionally it can be the case that for poorer countries not students from the entire country were selected, but instead only from particular regions.

PISA, as well as TIMSS, are standardizing their results so that the average score of students from OECD countries is 500 and the student standard deviation is 100. Assuming a normal distribution of measurement outcomes this means 68% of OECD students are reaching scores in the range between 400 and 600.

While TIMSS focuses on content that is covered in the school curriculum PISA aims to "assesses the application of skills to real-life problems" andÂ "emphasizes the importance of the context in which students should be able to use their skills (schools, home and society)".

PISA tests the students in three different dimensions, which they define as follows:[ref]Cited from PISA 2015 Results (Volume II) <em>Policies and Practices for Successful Schools</em>. Online <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/9816071e.pdf?expires=1507658106&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=B97B1B4F48D8D618D0E03486C41BB787">here</a>.[/ref]
<ul>
 	<li><em>"<strong>Science literacy</strong> is defined as the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen. A scientifically literate person is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science and technology, which requires the competencies to explain phenomena scientifically, evaluate and design scientific enquiry, and interpret data and evidence scientifically.</em></li>
 	<li><em><strong>Reading literacy</strong> is defined as studentsâ€™ ability to understand, use, reflect on and engage with written texts in order to achieve oneâ€™s goals, develop oneâ€™s knowledge and potential, and participate in society.</em></li>
 	<li><em><strong>Mathematical literacy</strong> is defined as studentsâ€™ capacity to formulate, employ and interpret mathematics in a variety of contexts. It includes reasoning mathematically and using mathematical concepts, procedures, facts and tools to describe, explain and predict phenomena. It assists individuals in recognising the role that mathematics plays in the world and to make the well-founded judgements and decisions needed by constructive, engaged and reflective citizens."</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Cross country comparability of the PISA results</strong>

When the PISA study includes non-OECD countries it is often the case that students are not selected from the entire country, but instead only from selected regions within that country.Â Results reported for China â€“ <a href="http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/embed/map?lg=en">and labelled as such by the OECD</a> â€“ in fact are only based on four Chinese provinces: Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong. These regions are not representative of China as a whole and there is every reason to expect that students from these provinces have access to better education than the average Chinese 15-year-olds. The four regions are among the very richest regions of China and incomes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_GDP_per_capita">up to twice that of the national Chines average</a>.

Similarly when PISA reported on "India" in 2009 the assessments were made in two states of India only (Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).
<h4>TIMSS â€“ Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study</h4>
As the name says, TIMSS is an assessment of theÂ mathematics and science knowledge of students. As the closely linked PIRLSÂ it is carried out by the <em>International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement</em> (IEA).

While PISA selects the assessed students by age and focusses on 15-year olds, TIMMS selects students by the grade they attend and tests students in Grades 4, 8, and in their final year.

TIMSS started slightly earlier than PISA. The first TIMSS was conducted in 1995 andÂ covered 45 national educational systems. Later rounds included more countries â€“ the 2011 round included 77 countries/area. The coverage of TIMSS is similar to PISA and includes mostly richer countries which are part of the OECD and only few poorer countries.Â The coverage of TIMSS can be seen in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-score-for-4th-graders-on-the-timss-science-assessment">this map</a> on the results in the science dimension.

Precursors to TIMSS were already conducted from 1964 onwards.
<h4>PIRLS â€“Â Progress in International Reading Literacy Study</h4>
The PIRLS is the other major study carried out by the IEA. HereÂ the objective is to assess primary school students in reading proficiency. PIRLS only started in 2001.



<h4>LLECE â€“Â Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education</h4>
LLECE is an assessment carried out only in <strong>Latin American</strong> countries. This map shows theÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/llece-mean-performance-on-the-mathematics-scale-for-6th-grade-students">mathematics score of 6th graders</a>. More information on LLECE is published by the UNESCO <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/santiago/terce/latin-american-laboratory-for-assessment-of-the-quality-of-education-llece/">here</a>.
<h4>PIAAC â€“Â Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies</h4>
The OECD also surveys the skills of adults.Â <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/piaac-mean-adult-numeracy-proficiency-2012-2015">Here</a> is the world map showing the level of numeracy of adults that gives an idea of the covered area. More information on PIAAC can be found <a href="http://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/">here</a>.
<h4>PASEC â€“Â Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems</h4>
PASEC, which in the original French refers toÂ <em>Programme dâ€™ Analyse des SystÃ¨mes Educatifs</em>, has assessed educational outcomes in 13 countries in <strong>Francophone West Africa</strong>. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pasec-mean-performance-on-the-french-language-scale-for-5th-grade-students-2004-2010">Here</a> is a map of outcomes in the dimension of the French language.
<h4>EGRA and EGMA â€“Â Early Grade Reading Assessment and Math Assessment</h4>
EGRA and EGMA are simple, low-cost assessments of literacy and numeracy.
<h4>APRESt â€“ Andhra Pradesh Randomized Evaluation Studies</h4>
APRESt is a large-scale randomized evaluation in the <strong>Indian state of Andra Pradesh</strong> that has been carried out since 2004.
<h4 class="p1">ASER â€“Â Annual Status of Education Report</h4>
ASER is a report that isÂ based on a survey of more than 500,000 children in rural areas across <strong>India</strong>. It is not a school-based, but instead an in-home assessment of the reading and mathematical skills of children between 3 and 16. The first ASER was carried out in 2005.
<h4>UWEZO</h4>
UWEZO is an adaptation of ASER carried out in <strong>three east African countries</strong> (Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya). It has been done since 2009 and is carried out annually.
<h4 class="p1">SACMEQ â€“ Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Measuring Educational Quality</h4>
An assessment carried out by education ministries from fifteen <strong>southern and eastern African countries</strong>. The study assesses students in grade 6 in the domains of reading and mathematics. The first study was carried out in 1995. The studies' website is: <a href="http://www.sacmeq.org/">www.sacmeq.org</a>

<h3>Studies that combine educational outcome measures</h3>

With a multitude on different assessments of learning outcomes which focus on different geographical areas and different skills it is an obvious idea to try to combine these measures into a common system to get a more comprehensive perspective on educational outcomes across the world. Several researchers have attempted to do this.
<h4>Altinok, Diebolt &amp; Demeulemeester (2014)</h4>
The researchers Altinok, Diebolt &amp; Demeulemeester published their dataset and their accompanying paper under the title<em> A new international database on education quality: 1965â€“2010.</em>[ref]Nadir Altinok, Claude Diebolt &amp; Jean-Luc Demeulemeester (2014) â€“ <em>A new international database on education quality: 1965â€“2010</em>. In Applied Economics, 46:11, 1212-1247, DOI: 10.1080/00036846.2013.868592[/ref]

The authors write that they "merge all existing regional and international student achievement tests by using a specific methodology". The resulting dataset includes indicators of the quality of student achievement for 103 countries/areas in primary education and 111 countries/areas in secondary education between 1965 and 2010.
<h4>Hanushek and WÃ¶ÃŸmann (2012)</h4>
The education economists Eric Hanushek and Ludger WÃ¶ÃŸmann are combining the results from educational achievement tests to investigate the question whether the quality of education has a causal influence on the growth of the economy.[ref]Hanushek, E. A. and Woessmann, L. (2012) â€“ <em>Do better school lead to more growth? Cognitive skills, economic outcomes, and causation</em>. In Journal of Economic Growth, 17, 267â€“321. The paper is available <a href="http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%2BWoessmann%202012%20JEconGrowth%2017%284%29.pdf">on Eric Hanushek's website</a>Â and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-012-9081-x">at the journal's site</a>.[/ref]

The database the authors published â€“ and which is available on the <a href="http://www.cesifo.de/ifoHome/CESifo-Group/ifo/ifo-Mitarbeiter/cvifo-woessmann_l/Ludger-Woessmann--Data.html">authors'</a> <a href="http://hanushek.stanford.edu/download">websites</a> â€“ includes measure for 77 countries. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-test-score-in-mathematics-and-science">This map</a> shows their main test score.

They extend earlier efforts byÂ Hanushek and Kimko (2000) published in the American Economic Review.[ref]Hanushek, E. A., &amp; Kimko, D. D. (2000) â€“ <em>Schooling, labor force quality, and the growth of nations</em>. American Economic Review, 90(5), 1184â€“1208.[/ref]

<h3>Literacy</h3>
Literacy is the learning outcome with the widest available data, both geographically and over time.

Literacy and illiteracy rates and absolute number of people for many countries are available by age group and by sex. For many countries literacy data is available for the last decades and for some countries data is also available for the last several centuries.

In the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/">Our World in Data entry on literacy</a> you find more information and a presentation of the most important data.

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Education Equality</h2>
Datasets that publish estimates of mean years of schooling often also provide estimates of the <strong>inequality of years of schooling</strong> in a population. The most common metric used to capture this inequality is the Gini index.

Also surveys â€“ such as the <em>Demographic and Health Survey</em> (DHS) and theÂ <em>Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey</em> (MICS) â€“ publish Gini rates of average years of schooling.

To measure <strong>gender inequality</strong> it is common practice to report <strong>ratios</strong> of metrics for males and females, such as the ratio between average years of schooling of women and men. The UNESCO often refers to this ratio as the "Gender Parity Index".

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Teachers</h2>
Several measures on teachers are available across countries â€“ many of which you find visualized in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/teachers-and-professors/">our entry on teachers and professors</a>:

<strong>Absolute number of teachers:</strong> TheÂ UNESCO Institute for Statistics publishes the absolute number of teachers by sex and level of education (primary, secondary, and tertiary)

<strong>Share of female teachers:Â </strong>These share, broken down by level of education, are by theÂ UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

<strong>Share of teachers who are trained</strong>: Data on theÂ share of teachers who have received the minimum organized teacher training (pre-service or in-service) required for teaching at a given level of education in a particular country is also published by theÂ UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This data is available is also available by sex and the ratio between the two measures is published as theÂ gender parity index (GPI).

<strong>Pupil-to-teacher ratio:</strong> These ratios, broken down by level of education, are also published by theÂ UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

Also published are theÂ <strong>ratios of the number of 'teacher training graduates' to teachers who are currently working</strong>.[ref]In the World Bank's EdStats dataset this information is only available in the regional Africa Dataset.[/ref]

<strong>Annual teacher salaries in US-$:</strong> Data on salaries of teachers is published by level of education and additionally by experience of the teacher by the OECD. The OECD breaks this down by starting salary, 10 years of experience,Â 15 years of experience, and top of scale salary.

Salaries are reported as gross salaries â€“ the total sum paid by the employer. Income taxes are not deducted in these reported salaries, but the employerâ€™s contribution to social security and pension is deducted. The OECD adds thatÂ "teachersâ€™ salaries are one component of teachersâ€™ total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachersâ€™ total remuneration."

Additionally the OECD differentiates between statutory salaries â€“ "the scheduled salaries according to official pay scales" â€“ and actual salaries â€“ "the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher".

As an example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-salary-of-primary-teachers-with-10-years-of-experience">here is a map</a> of salary of primary teachers.

<strong>All staff compensation as share of total expenditure in public institutions:</strong>Â This measure is published by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics and is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/all-staff-compensation-as-share-of-total-expenditure-in-public-institutions">available for more than just the OECD countries</a>. It includes the compensation of all staff (teacher and non-teachers) and expresses this as the share of direct expenditure in public educational institutions (instructional and non-instructional). Staff compensation includes salaries, contributions by employers for staff retirement programmes, and other allowances and benefits.
<h2>Measures on School Infrastructure</h2>
There is some data available on the infrastructure in schools.Â In the World Bank's <em>EdStats</em> dataset the following information is available in the regional <em>Africa Dataset</em> only:
<ul>
 	<li>Data is available for theÂ share of schools with and without access to <strong>electricity</strong>, <strong>toilets</strong> (broken down by single-sex and mixed-sex toilets), and <strong>access to potable water</strong>.</li>
 	<li>There is also some data on the average number of pupils per mathematics (and reading) <strong>textbook</strong> in primary education.</li>
 	<li>Data on average <strong>class sizes</strong> is also available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measures on Expenditure on Education</h2>
Data is available on the expenditure on the educational systems in several dimensions. For visualizations of some of the empirical data and research see <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education">our entry on financing of education</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Education Systems</h2>
Data is available on the structure of the educational systems in several dimensions:
<ul>
 	<li>TheÂ <em>UNESCO Institute for Statistics</em> publishes data on the "<strong>Duration of compulsory education</strong>", the "Official <strong>entrance age</strong> to compulsory education", and also more detailed information such as official entrance age and theoretical duration of the different levels of education â€“ such as pre-primary education, primary education, and (lower and upper) secondary educational level.</li>
 	<li>The UNESCO also publishes the "<strong>theoretical duration</strong>" â€“ measured in number of grades (in years) â€“ by level of education.</li>
 	<li>Enrollment in <strong>private and public institutions</strong> is available. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-enrolled-in-private-institutions-at-the-primary-education-level">Here</a> is a map for primary education as an example.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>International Mobility</h2>
At the tertiary education level data is available on the international mobility of students:
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>inbound mobility rate</strong> is the ratio between the number of students from abroad studying in a given country and the the total number of enrolled students in that country. It is also available by sex and level of education.</li>
 	<li>For outgoing students of a particular country the <strong>outbound mobility rate</strong> is published.</li>
</ul>
Maps of both measures can be found in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/tertiary-education/#international-mobility-of-students">our entry on tertiary education</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Educational Policy</h2>
<h4>SABER â€“Â Systems Approach for Better Education Results</h4>
SABER is an effort by the World Bank to produce comparative data on education system policies and institutions. Published are a range of policy metrics on management systems, teachers, student assessments, school health and school feeding, school autonomy and accountability, school finance, workforce development, and early childhood development. The website is <a href="http://saber.worldbank.org/index.cfm">here</a>.

<h2>Sources for data on educational attainment</h2>
Census and registers published by the national statistical offices are the most reliable source for educational attainment. But not all countries have built the capabilities to produce such statistics. Which data sources do we have available when census and register data is not available?

The world map below is published by the researchers of IIASA who assembled a global dataset of educational attainment for their research and searched for the most accurate data source for each country. The original datasources, which were seen as the most accurate in each country, are shown in the world map below.

We see that the IIASA researchers rank censuses as the most reliable data sources and in the absence of these they rely on survey data, preferably on labor force surveys or national surveys and if these are not available either on the DHS (for many African countries) or other in rare cases other surveys. The authors <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">write</a> that for "the remaining 24â€”mostly smallâ€”countries, assumptions on the education structure had to be made by analogy."

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children's Rights</a></strong>.</div>
<ul>
 	<li>Child maltreatment is common and takes many forms. From <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/#violent-discipline">physical or emotional abuse</a>, to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/">child labor</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/#child-marriage-and-female-genital-mutilation">other practices that violate their most basic rights</a>.</li>
 	<li>Violence against children, at home, schools, or in the broader society, affects educational outcomes. It affects whether children are able to attend and remain in school, as well as whether they make progress in terms of learning outcomes. And at the same time, educational outcomes affect violence â€“ education has been identified as a tool to reduce violence against children.</li>
 	<li>In this post we focus on the importance of child maltreatment specifically in the context of children's education and give an overview of the empirical evidence.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Child Labor</strong>

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/#definitions-and-measurement">Child labor constitutes in most situations a violation of children's rights,</a> as it is often linked to several forms of abuse and harm. Specifically in the context of education, child labor is often linked to poor educational outcomes. The following visualization, from Schultz and Strauss (2008),[ref] Eric V. Edmonds "Child Labor", Chapter 57 in T. Paul Schultz, John Strauss (2008), Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 4. North Holland[/ref] shows evidence for this. It plots school attendance rates for children aged 10â€“14 years olds, against total hours worked in the last week (by type of work) with 95 percent confidence intervals (labeled CI and plotted in lighter shades).

Children who work more hours tend to attend school less frequently. And the steepest segments of the pictured curves are in the range 20-45 hours, which suggests â€” as one would naturally expect â€” that it is most difficult for a child to attend school when approachingÂ full-time work. 

This evidence also shows that there is no significant difference between children engaged in domestic or marketed work.

Edmonds &quot;Child Labor&quot;, Chapter 57 in T. Paul Schultz, John Strauss (2008), Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 4. North Holland." width="400" height="281" /></a></h6>

The chart above shows the relationship between school attendance and hours worked using <em>micro</em> data, which means that the authors investigate the relationship across <em>individual</em> households. A similar pattern can also be seen in the data if we look at the corresponding country-level macro variables: In countries where children tend to work longer hours, it is more common that working children remain out of school. The interactive chart below shows this by plotting country-level average hours worked by children against share of working children who are out of school.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/working-children-out-of-school-ages-7-14-vs-hours-worked-by-children-ages-7-14" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

These correlations on the micro and macro level are of course not enough to establish a causal relationship. There are many potential economic and cultural factors that simultaneously influence both schooling and work decisions; and in any case, the direction of the relationships is not obviousâ€”do children work because they are not attending school, or do they fail to attend school because they are working?

A number of academic studies have tried to investigate whether there is indeed aÂ causal relationship by attempting to find a factor (an â€˜<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation">instrumental variable</a>â€™) that only affects whether a child works without affecting how the family values other uses of the childâ€™s time.Â These studies â€“ like Rosati &amp; Rossi 2003 or Gunnarsson, Orazem &amp; Sanchez 2006)[ref] Rosati, F., Rossi, M. (2003). <a href="ftp://www.ceistorvergata.it/repec/rpaper/No-25-Rosati,Rossi.pdf">Childrenâ€™s working hours and school enrollment: Evidence from Pakistan and Nicaragua</a>. World Bank Economic Review 17, 283â€“295. Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006)[ref]Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006). <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/orazem/Child%20Labor%20in%20Latin%20America.pdf">Child labor and school achievement in Latin America</a>. World Bank Economic Review 20, 31â€“54.[/ref] â€“ suggest that there is indeed a causal relationship: work often does determine whether a child remains in, or drops out of, school.

<strong>Physical and psychological abuse</strong>

Children who are victims of physical or psychological abuse tend to have worse educational outcomes; and while evidence supporting a causal link is scarce, it is important to pay attention to these correlations.

A recent study used detailed household surveys from South Africa and Malawi to document the prevalence of violent discipline and subsequent changes in school progress among the affected children. The study found that children who were exposed to psychological and physical violence for discipline were more likely to have dropped out of school upon follow-up (Sherr et al. 2015).[ref]Sherr, L., Hensels, I. S., Skeen, S., Tomlinson, M., Roberts, K. J., &amp; Macedo, A. (2015). Exposure to violence predicts poor educational outcomes in young children in South Africa and Malawi. International health, 8(1), 36-43.[/ref]

Other studies have found that violence against children also correlates with poor educational outcomes in the long run. In rich countries, for example, studies have found that individuals who are exposed to sexual and physical abuse in childhood are more likely to drop out of college (Boden et al. 2007 and Duncan 2000).[ref]Boden, J. M., Horwood, L. J., &amp; Fergusson, D. M. (2007). Exposure to childhood sexual and physical abuse and subsequent educational achievement outcomes. Child abuse &amp; neglect, 31(10), 1101-1114. Duncan, R. D. (2000). Childhood maltreatment and college drop-out rates: Implications for child abuse researchers. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 15(9), 987-995.[/ref]

These correlations also extend to other forms of violence and other types of educational outcomes. Within schools, for instance, violence between children tends to go together with poor learning outcomes. The following chart provides an example of this correlation. It shows, for a number of countries, the percentage of grade 8 students scoring above the low international benchmark in the TIMSS mathematics test, by their involvement in physical fights in school. Numeracy results were consistently higher among children not involved in physical fights in school.
<h6>School fighting vs Minimum proficiency in maths â€“ UNESCO (2016) [ref]Figure 4.3 in UNESCO (2016), Education for People and Planet, Global Education Monitoring Report. Available online <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002457/245752e.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]</h6>

Physical and psychological abuse are often linked to negative effects on mental and physical health. For example, it has been documented that anxiety and depression tend to arise more frequently among children who are abused.[ref]Norman, R. E., Byambaa, M., De, R., Butchart, A., Scott, J., &amp; Vos, T. (2012). The long-term health consequences of child physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect: a systematic review and meta-analysis. PLoS medicine, 9(11), e1001349. Available <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] Again, these correlations do not imply causation. But there are good reasons to take them seriously. The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Development Report (2018)</a> notes that toxic stress in the early years can undermine lifelong health, learning, and behavior, because the hormones associated with the fight-or-flight response, such as cortisol, can inhibit physical growth and the childrenâ€™s susceptibility to illness. It is also the case that these hormones can impair the development of neural connections in parts of the brain that are critical for learning.

The following is an example of the type of brain development problems that scientists attribute to sensory neglect in early childhood. The source is Perry (2002).[ref]Perry, B. D. (2002). Childhood experience and the expression of genetic potential: What childhood neglect tells us about nature and nurture. Brain and mind, 3(1), 79-100.[/ref] The CT scan on the left is an image from a healthy three year old with a typical head size (at the 50th percentile of the distribution). The image on the right is from a three year old child suffering from 'severe sensory-deprivation neglect' â€“ minimal exposure to language, touch, and social interactions. The brain of the child on the right is significantly smaller than average (3rd percentile) and has signs of deterioration (cortical atrophy).

Of course, this comparison is just an illustration, and it is hard to know with certainty whether the observed differences in brain size can be fully attributed to sensory-deprivation neglect. However, Perry finds that the average head size among a group of 40 children who had suffered sensory neglect is below the 5th percentile in the distribution â€“ and while some recovery in brain-size was observed after children were removed from the neglectful environment, in most cases the gaps remained significant.

These findings are relevant to education because brain malleability is much greater earlier in life, and brain development is sequential and cumulative; which means that brain deterioration can lead to permanent impairments on skill acquisition.[ref]Perry (2002) writes: <em>"In following these globally-neglected children over time we observed some recovery of function and relative brain-size when these children were removed from the neglectful environment and placed in foster care. The degree of recovery over a year period however was inversely proportional to age in which the child was removed from the neglecting caregivers. The earlier in life and the less time in the sensory-depriving environment, the more robust the recovery."</em>[/ref]

<strong>Feedback loops</strong>

The interaction between violence and education operates in both directions, which means education can be used as an instrument to reduce the prevalence of violence. In Uganda, for example, a programme that provided life skills and vocational training for girls who had been forced into sexual acts, led to substantially fewer of these girls being victims of sexual abuse â€“ an impact largely attributed to acquired skills (Bandiera et al. 2017).[ref]The evidence in this study comes from a Randomized Control Trial.

Similarly, parenting interventions that promote skills and knowledge among parents have shown positive effects on domestic violence. In Liberia, for example, a program that provided training in positive parenting and non-violent behaviour reduced violent punishment drastically (Sim et al. 2014).[ref]The evidence in this study comes from comparisons in reported punishment attitudes before and after the intervention, relative to the changes observed in a control group (i.e. the evidence comes from a Randomized Control Trial with a control group).

<strong>Wrapping up</strong>

Evidence from a range of countries shows that there is a correlation between violence against children and educational outcomes. These correlations are strong and hold for different forms of victimization. In some cases there is evidence of causal relationships; but even in contexts where causality is not clear, these correlations are important because they show that different forms of hardship often converge on some of the most vulnerable members of society.";s:10:"post_title";s:43:"Child maltreatment and educational outcomes";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:48:"violence-childrens-rights-and-education-outcomes";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-12-18 20:28:06";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-12-18 20:28:06";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=13847";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"13892";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-08 11:25:37";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-08 11:25:37";s:12:"post_content";s:41767:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to upecific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-world-population-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Future World Population Growth</a></strong>.</div>
Hans Rosling famously <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies/transcript">coined the term</a>Â 'peak child' for the moment in global demographic history at which the number of children in the world stops increasing.

In this post I look into the latest data â€“ and various demographic projections â€“ to ask when the world will reach 'peak child' and how the number of children in the world will evolve in the future.

From studying this question we can learn two things: First, it allows us to understand how the world's population will continue to evolve.

Second, projections of the number of children in the world provide insights into the upper limit of demand for education in the future.[ref]While there might be children who will not receive education, it is clear that the absolute number of children is the upper bound for the total demand for childhood education.[/ref]Â If we want to understand the challenges for educating the world's population of tomorrow, then we must have a good understanding of how the number of young children will evolve.

A quick preview of the results:
<ul>
 	<li>The world has probably not reached 'peak child' yet. However, we are likely very close to a long flat peak; the number of children in the world will not increase much more. We are close to the peak.</li>
 	<li>A key insight from projections, under different scenarios, is that the number of children in the long-run will depend on how successful the world will be in providing education â€“ in particular to women â€“ in the short-run. This is because women that are better educated tend to have fewer children. If we are successful in providing accessible education for all in the near-term, there will be fewer children â€“ and therefore less demand for education â€“ in the future.</li>
 	<li>In the last part of this post I will discuss how the size of the population will change in different world regions. Crucial will be the African continent: fast development in Africa will slow down population growth, whereas slow development would leave African countries in an extended period of fast population growth. The latter scenario could see the African population growing 5-fold over the 21st century.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thelastdecadesandthenextdecades">The last decades and the next decades</h3>
Between 1950 and today the world population tripled: from 2.5 billion to 7.5 billion. Over this period educational systems around the world had to provide education for substantially larger cohorts of children at school age.Â Since 1950 the total number of children younger than 15 years of age increased rapidly, from 0.87 billion children to 1.96 billion today. The world was largely successful in getting more children into school; while the number of children increased globally there were fewer and fewer out-of-school children. In the last two decades the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/out-of-school-children-of-primary-school-age-by-world-region">number of out-of-school children has almost halved</a>.

The future will be very different from the past. Over recent decades we have seen global demographic changes which will bring about the end of rapid population growth: Until the mid-1960s each woman around the world had on average 5 children. Since then the number of children has halved and is now just below 2.5 children per woman. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL">global fertility rate has halved</a>.

Based on these demographic changes the UN Population Division makes projections of how the world population will change until the end of this century. The Medium Variant of this projection is shown in the visualization below and it shows that with respect to demographic changes the challenges for providing education in this century will be substantially smaller than in the last century. With a much lower global fertility rate, the increase in educational pressures will be much slower than the last 50 years. In fact the number of children will rise only very slowly and will barely increase at all over the coming century. The UN expects the number of children to peak in 2057 at 2.09 billion children and by the end of the century the number of children will be basically the same as today (just below 2 billion in the UN forecast).[ref]The number of children younger than 15 years:
In 1950: 0.87 billion
In 2017: 1.96 billion
Peak in 2057: 2.094 billion
In 2100: 1.98 billion[/ref]

Since the middle of the 20th century the number of school-age-children increased by 125%. From today to the peak number of children, the number of children will only increase by 7%. If these projections are correct, then the world is not quite at 'peak child' yet, but we are approaching a flat plateau at which, over the course of the next 4 decades, we will gradually reach a very flat peak.[ref]This can also be seen in how the global population pyramid has evolved â€“ we have visualized the pyramid <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/World-Population-Pyramid-for-1950-2016-2100.png">here</a>. The base of the pyramid has widened greatly since 1950, but over the decades until the end of the century it is projected to shrink for the very young cohorts.[/ref]

While over the last decades the worldâ€™s educational systems were strained with the task ofÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/primary-and-secondary-education">substantially increasing the <em>quantity</em> of education</a>, from today until 2100 there will be little increase in the number of school-aged children. We can therefore focus our efforts instead on increasing the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education"><em>quality</em> of education</a>.

Population growth is driven by three changes: Fertility, mortality, and migration. Until space travel becomes an option it is only the first two aspects only that matter at the global level.

Education matters for both mortality and fertility:

<strong>Education â€“&gt; Mortality â€“&gt; Fertility rates:Â </strong>The education of mothers is important for the health and mortality of children and there is a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/#better-education-of-women-reduces-child-mortality">strong link</a> between higher education of mothers and lower mortality of their children.[ref]See for example Emmanuela Gakidou, Krycia Cowling, Rafael Lozano, Christopher JL Murray (2010) â€“Â <a href="http://can-mnch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5.-EducationandChildSurvivalLancet.pdf">Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis</a>, The Lancet, Volume 376, Issue 9745, 18â€“24 September 2010, Pages 959-974, ISSN 0140-6736, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3.[/ref]

A reduction of child mortality would of course directly increase the number of children. However, it is more complicated than that. In addition to this direct effect of fewer child deaths there is an important indirect effect: When fewer children die, families decide to have fewer children in the first place which results in a decline in fertility rates. This is an important part of the reason why <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-population-growth">population growth is low where theÂ mortality of children is low</a>.
<p id="educationâ€“fertility"><strong>Education â€“&gt; Fertility rates:</strong>Â From demographic research we know that improvingÂ the education of women has been one of the most important drivers of the halving of the global fertility rate from 5 to 2.5 children per woman over the last 4 decades. Today,Â <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?time=2015">population growth is high where fertility remains high</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility?time=2010">fertility rates remain high where the education of women remains low</a>.</p>
In the entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#what-explains-the-change-in-the-number-of-children-women-have">fertility rates</a> we present the research that shows that this is not just a correlation; better education indeed causes a decline in the number of children per woman. This is the key mechanism at work here.

<strong>Education â€“&gt; Population growth</strong>

Today it is the fertility rate that matters for population growth.[ref]The researchers Lutz, Butz, and KC summarize saying â€œthe calculations [â€¦] show that the drop in fertility has a far greater net effect than improved child survival rates. As a result, better education is associated with a clear reduction in population growth. For this reason, universal female education â€“ in addition to its many other positive implications â€“ is likely an effective way to slow the worldâ€™s population growth.â€

One way to see that the fertility rate is key â€“ and not child mortality â€“ is to look at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth">the correlation between the two measures</a>. A second way to see this is to play out a scenario in which fertility rates would stay at their current level â€“ the UN has such an illustrative scenario with constant fertility rates and in this scenario the world population would continue to grow extremely fast and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/comparison-of-world-population-projections">reach a population of 26 billion</a>(!) in the year 2100. The fertility rate is what matters for population growth and education therefore matters because it is a strong determinant of fertility rates.
<h3>The WC-IIASA projections: How investments in education matter for the global population in the 21st century</h3>
In this post I am focussing on two sets of projections: the UN projections â€“ as they are the most widely discussed projections â€“ and the projections published by IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre, which I refer to as the WC-IIASA projections.[ref] These projections are presented in detail in Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/world-population-and-human-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century-9780198703167?cc=us&lang=en&">Editors</a> â€“ World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press.

The executive summary is here:Â <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf</a>

The work is produced at two closely related research centers in Austria:
<ol>
 	<li>The first of these institutions is the <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Introduction.html">World Population Program (POP)</a> at the <em>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</em> (IIASA).</li>
 	<li>And the second institution is the <em><a href="http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm">Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital</a>.</em></li>
</ol>
Available are these projections <a href="http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/shiny/wic/">here</a>.[/ref]

Future projections of global population are uncertain. Much of the uncertainty comes from the fact that we do not know which investments the world will make in those systems that determine mortality and fertility â€“ most importantly in education, as we have just explored.

The WC-IIASA projections differ from the work of the United Nations in a number of <a href="https://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">fundamental ways</a>Â â€“ see the footnote for details.[ref]The UN projections take into account the historical data on each countryâ€™s demography and build projections based on this quantitative information.

In contrast to this, the WC-IIASA projections also take into account the <em>qualitative</em> assessments of 550 demographers from around the world which the WC-IIASA researchers have surveyed to gather their ideas on how population change in different parts of the world will play out. They then combine the country specific expertise of these researchers with similar quantitative information that the UN and others rely on as well.

The assumptions behind the projections are presented in more detail in WolfgangÂ Lutz and Samir KC (2017) â€“ The human core of the shared socioeconomic pathways: Population scenarios by age, sex and level of education for all countries to 2100. In Global Environmental Change Volume 42, January 2017, Pages 181â€“192. Online here:Â <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001095">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001095</a>[/ref]. While the projections by WC-IIASA are less widely known than the UN projections, the WC-IIASA work is certainly very respected among demographers and key publications by the researchers are regularly published in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.[ref] Lutz, W., Sanderson, W. C., &amp; Scherbov, S. (1997). Doubling of world population unlikely. Nature, 387(6635), 803â€“805.

Lutz, W., Sanderson, W. C., &amp; Scherbov, S. (2008). The coming acceleration of global population ageing. Nature, 451(7179), 716â€“719.[/ref]

Most importantly for our discussion here is that while other projections only structure demographic data by sex and age-group, the WC-IIASA data also breaks down the population data by the level of highest <em>educational attainment</em>. This information on educational attainment is then used for both the output of the model â€“ so that population projections for each country of the world by highest educational attainment are available (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">on Our World in Data here</a>). And crucially this information on education is also used as an input to the model so that the impact of different future scenarios for education on both mortality and fertility can be modeled explicitly.

The level of highest educational attainment is categorized in a system that aims to capture the structure of populations across the different country-specific educational systems â€“ see the footnote for details.[ref]These categorizations are based on the the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which was designed by the UNESCO to make education statistics comparable across countries. WC-IIASA breaks down the educational structure into the following 6 categories and the table summarizes how the six categories are defined, how they correspond to ISCED 1997, and the main allocation rules the researchers used.

<em>This table â€“ showing <strong>Categories of educational attainment used by IIASA-WC and how they correspond to the ISCED levels</strong> â€“ is taken fromÂ Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC [Editors] (2014)Â â€“ Executive Summary: World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

For children younger than 15 years old no educational attainment information is available as most are still in the education system.

<h4 id="fourfuturescenariosforglobaleducation">The four future scenarios for global education</h4>
The researchers developed 4 different basic scenarios to model the demographic structure of the global population:[ref]In addition to these 4 basic scenarios there areÂ a larger number of combinations based on these scenarios used in the WC-IIASA work.[/ref]

<strong>Constant Enrollment Numbers (CEN) scenario:</strong> This is the researcher's most pessimistic scenario. Here it is assumed that in the future no more schools are opened in any place in the world, and so the absolute number of people reaching a particular educational level is frozen at the current level.[ref]This implies that enrollment rates are declining when the population size increases. In practice the WC-IIASA researchers almost always consider CER as the most pessimistic scenario and only rarely discuss CEN.[/ref]

<strong>Constant Enrollment Rates (CER) scenario</strong>: This is another pessimistic scenario. While in the CEN scenario the absolute <em>number</em>Â of enrolled students stagnates, the assumption in the CER scenario is that the <em>rate </em>of enrollment stagnates. In this scenario the most recently observed rates of educational enrollment are frozen at their current rate and no further improvement in enrollment is assumed.
This will still result in further improvements of adult education because in many countries the younger cohorts are better educated than the older ones. But in the longer run this scenario also implies stagnation.

<strong>Fast Track (FT) scenario:</strong> This scenario is the most optimistic one and here it is assumed that countries follow the most rapid education expansion achieved in recent history â€“ that of South Korea.

<strong>Global Education Trend (GET) scenario:</strong> This is the middle scenario and here the researchers assume that countries will follow the average path of educational expansion that countries further advanced in this process have experienced.
In this scenario the researchers project the medium future trajectory based on the experience of all countries over the past 40 years
The researchers write:Â â€œThe GET scenario is moderately optimistic, and can be considered as the most likely.â€[ref]Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC [Editors] (2014)Â â€“ Executive Summary: World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press. <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf</a>[/ref]
<h3 id="thesizeandstructureoftheworldpopulationunderdifferenteducationalscenarios">The size and structure of the world population under different educational scenarios</h3>
Now we can see how the size of the total world population and the educational achievements of this population will evolve under these four scenarios.

In the visualization below we see that these differences matter very substantially even for the evolution of world population over the next 5 decades. By 2060 the world population is projected to reach 9.8 billion under the Constant Enrollment Rates (CER) scenario, which is pessimistic about improvements in global education. If we assume optimistic progress in global education, as in the Fast Track (FT) scenario, global population is projected to increase to only 8.9 billion. A difference of almost one billionÂ â€“ as early as 2060 â€“ may therefore be solely driven by differences in progress on global education.

The result that alternative education scenarios alone make a difference of one billion for the global population over such a short time frame is shown in more detail in a publication in Science by Lutz and KC (2011)[ref] Lutz, Wolfgang and Samir KC (2011) â€“ Global human capital: integrating education and population. In Science,Â 333Â (2011), pp.Â 587â€“592 <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/587.full">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/587.full</a>

The changes of the demographic structure of the world population stem from two forces predominantly: Firstly the different assumptions about the trajectories in female educational attainment, and secondly, different levels of education-specific fertility.
In the analysis below, the education-specific fertility levels will differ across scenarios, but to gauge the importance of different possible trajectories I am here interested in the effect of the different assumptions about the trajectories of educational attainment. This lets us see the impact of different futures with respect to educational attainmentÂ alone.[/ref].

While the differences between the educational scenarios are slow to materialize and only show up after some decades,[ref]As can be seen from the chart, improvements in the education of women will eventually have a large impact on the size of the global population. But for two reasons the impact of educational improvements in the short-run will take some time to become apparent on a global scale: The first reason for this lag is that a girl who receives additional education now will only be in her childbearing years in 15 to 20 years.Â The second reason is that population momentum, driven by a high proportion of women in their child bearing years, can mean that the population keeps on growing even if the fertility rate falls to the replacement level.[/ref] they are then very substantial and matter hugely for the size of the future world population.Â Our attention and progress in education now will really matter for the size of the global population.

<h3 id="differencebetweenthemediumunandwc-iiasascenarios">Global demand for education: The population of school-age children</h3>
Let's see how different possible scenarios in educational improvements matter for 'peak child' and the size of the population in school age. For this we rely on scenarios of the WC-IIASA researchers which differ only in the assumptions on educational attainment.[ref]Otherwise they are identical and are all based on theÂ SSP2 scenarios, which the researchers see as their most likely scenario as it combines the medium fertility and medium mortality assumptions.

In these different scenarios <em>education-specific fertility levels</em>Â now also differ across scenarios, which means that the differences across scenarios are even larger than in the projections above where education-specific fertility levels were the same across the different scenarios.[/ref]

The visualization below shows the three projections of the size of the population of school-age-children until the end of this century:
<ul>
 	<li>According to the projection of the pessimisticÂ <em>Constant Enrollment Scenario</em> the population younger than 15 will evolve similarly to the Medium Variant projection of the UN. The number of children will continue to increase slowly and reach a plateau in the mid-21st century before the population will decline to a size similar to todayâ€™s population of under-15-year-olds.</li>
 	<li>Therefore the medium projection of WC-IIASA substantially differs from the UNâ€™s Medium projection. In the most likely scenario â€“Â <em>Global Education Trends</em> (GET), which the WC-IIASA researchers see as a continuation of the recent educational trends â€“ the size of the population younger than 15 will soon start to fall and at the end of the century the population of under-15-year-olds will be one-third smaller than today! According to this middle-of-the-road scenario by WC-IIASA the world is very close to 'child peak', as Hans Rosling claimed.</li>
 	<li>Even faster will be the decline in the <em>Fast Track</em> scenario. If the world can achieve such a rapid expansion of education, then the size of the population of under-15-year-olds is projected to fall and decline to just one billion in 2100 (almost the same level as 1950).</li>
</ul>
What this comparison of scenarios shows us is that the size of the global population younger than 15Â â€“ the upper bound for the global demand for educationÂ â€“ will very much depend on how rapidly access to education can be extended.[ref]It would be interesting to see the projected number of enrolled students under 15 by multiplying the projected enrollment rates with the projected population younger than 15, but unfortunately the underlying enrollment rates cannot be obtained from the <em>WC-IIASA dataexplorer</em>.[/ref]

A larger increase in the educational attainment in the short-run will mean that the size of cohorts that need investments in the long-run will be much smaller: The difference between no further improvements in the educational enrollment (CER scenario) and a continuation of the successful last decades will mean that the global population of under-15-year-olds will be half a billion smaller at the end of the century. An acceleration to the Fast Track (FT) scenario would mean that this global figure is again smaller by yet another 200 million children.

<h3 id="continentbycontinentâ€“totalpopulation">Continent by continent â€“ total population</h3>
So far we have looked at the total figures for the global population. What we have not yet taken into account is how the size of the population will evolve in different regions and countries of the world.
<h4 id="un">Total population: UN</h4>
The Medium Variant of the UN projections for all world regions until the end of this century is shown in the chart below. Changes to the population size of the Americas, Oceania, and Europe are very small compared to the large expected changes in Asia and Africa. The UN expects the population of Africa to quadruple from 1.2 billion in 2017 to 4.5 billion by the end of the century. This means the population of Africa will be as large as the population of Asia today, and the rate of this increase in the coming decades will also be very similar to the rate of population growth in Asia over the last few decades (when Asia's population increased from 1.4 billion in 1950 to 4.5 billion today).

For Asia, the UN projects an increase only until the mid-21st century when population is projected to plateau around 5.3 billion. In the second half of the 21st century, researchers foresee a decline of the Asian population to less than 5 billion by 2100.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4 id="wc-iiasa">Total population: WC-IIASA</h4>
The visualization below now shows in contrast the projections of the WC-IIASA researchers. Again the projected changes in the Americas, Oceania, and Europe are modest compared to changes in Africa and Asia. For Asia, this medium scenario by WC-IIASA projects an evolution that is very similar to the UN projection: The population will increase until the mid-21st century when the population plateaus (on a slightly lower level than in the UN projections) and then falls to well below 5 billion until the year 2100.

The big difference is Africa: While the UN projects that the population of Africa will quadruple, the WC-IIASA researchers expect only a doubling. This means the African population will stay well below 3 billion, with population growth almost coming to a halt at the end of this century.

The projections by education scenario can be seen <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-of-the-total-population-by-education-scenario">in this chart</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Projections-of-the-world-population-until-2100-by-the-Wittgenstein-Centre" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3 id="continentbycontinentâ€“fertilityrate">Continent by continent â€“ Fertility rate</h3>
As we have seen above, the crucial variable for how the world population will evolve is the total fertility rate: the number of children per woman. Let's see how this crucial variable is projected to evolve.

There is some uncertainty about the level of the fertility rate today in some countries with poorer coverage of demographic statistics. This discrepancy in estimates today is also obvious in the comparison of the UN and WC-IIASA, where the UN mostly assumes that fertility rates <em>today</em> are higher than those assumed by WC-IIASA.
For the development over the next century however the changes over time are more fundamental. So letâ€™s see what the projections of the UN and WC-IIASA entail.
<h4 id="un">Fertility rate: UN</h4>
The UN series shows that until 1966 women around the world had more than 5 children on average. Since then the fertility rate has halved and is now just below 2.5 children per woman. The UN projects that the fertility rate will further decline to 2.1 in 2070 and by the end of the century the fertility rate will fall below 2. A global fertility rate of 1.96 then would imply a decline of the global population over the long run.

In Africa the fertility rate only fell below 5 in 2005 â€“ four decades later than the global average. For the 21st century the UN Medium Variant projects a slow decline of the fertility rate in Africa to 2.1 children per woman until the end of the century.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-fertility-rate-by-development-level-including-UN-projections-through-2100?country=Africa-0+Africa-1+OWID_WRL-0+OWID_WRL-1" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4 id="wc-iiasa">Fertility rate: WC-IIASA</h4>
In their medium scenario â€“ SSP2 with the GET assumptions on global education â€“ the researchers project a much faster decline of the fertility rate than the UN. As early as the 2050s, the fertility rate will fall below 2 and by the end of the century will be 1.68 children per woman.

Africa too will reach a fertility rate below 2 by the 2070s under the medium assumptions â€“ you can add the projections for Africa by clicking the option "add projection" below the chart.

Interestingly the projections for the total fertility rate under the pessimistic Constant Enrollment Rates (CER) scenario are very similar to the UN Medium projection. Under this scenario the WC-IIASA researchers project a global fertility rate just below 2 and a fertility rate for Africa just above 2. The pessimistic scenario of WC-IIASA is similar to the UN Medium projection, and all of the more optimistic WC-IIASA scenarios imply lower fertility rates. In these optimistic scenarios, the global population is therefore significantly smaller at the end of the century, with smaller cohorts of school-age children throughout this period.

In the past decades UN demographers have been consistently too pessimistic in their projections of the global fertility rates <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-world-population-growth/#global-average-fertility-rate-and-life-expectancy">as we show in our assessment of the past UN projections</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-of-the-number-of-children-per-woman-by-education-scenario" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3 id="continentbycontinentâ€“populationyoungerthan15">Continent by continent â€“ population younger than 15</h3>
To see how the number of children in school age will evolve in different parts of the world, below we look at the population younger than 15 in all world regions separately and again compare the projections by the UN with those by WC-IIASA researchers.
<h4>Population younger than 15: UN</h4>
Shown below are the UN projections until the year 2100. Again, note the familiar picture of stagnating population sizes in Oceania, the Americas, and Europe. Due to the low fertility rates in Asia the UN projects a substantial decrease in the number of under-15-year-olds over the coming decades, falling from 1.1 billion today to 0.7 billion by 2100.

For Africa the UN projects an increase from 0.5 billion under-15-year-olds today to a peak of almost 1 billion in the 2090s when the number of children at school age is projected to start to decline.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-younger-than-15-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4 id="wc-iiasa">Population younger than 15: WC-IIASA</h4>
Now let us compare this with the projection of the world population by world region according to the medium projection of WC-IIASA â€“ the SSP2 scenario with the GET assumption on global educational improvements. For Asia the researchers project an even more substantial decline to just over half a billion in the year 2100. An even more substantial difference is projected for Africa where they project that the increase of the school-age population comes to an end below 600 million as early as 2050. By the end of the century the researchers expect a population of under-15-year-olds that is barely larger than today.

<h2 id="africaisgoingtobecrucial">Africa is going to be crucial</h2>
What we have seen in the different projections of future global population is that Africa is the most influential and contentious. What happens in Africa now and in the coming decades will determine what size and structure the global population will have at the end of the century.[ref]On this see also Wolfgang Fengler (2015) â€“ Will the world reach 10 billion people? - Brookings Institution. Online here: <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/09/04/will-the-world-reach-10-billion-people/">https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/09/04/will-the-world-reach-10-billion-people/</a>[/ref]

It seems less certain what the future for Africa will look like; there is considerable disagreement between UN and WC-IIASA projections. Even the medium projections vary significantly between the two institutions: The UN projects a population of 4.5 billion while WC-IIASA projects a population of only 2.6 billion. This difference of 2 billion is just as large as the difference between the projection for the global population by the UN (11.2 billion in 2100) and WC-IIASA (8.9 billion in 2100). Whether the world population increases to more than 10 billion will be decided by the speed with which Africa develops â€“ especially how quickly women get access to better education, women's opportunities within the job market, and how rapidly the improvements in child health continue.

This also matters significantly for some particular countries: For example, in Nigeria (currently a population of 190 million) the UN projects a population of 794 million at the end of the century. WC-IIASA, however, projects the population to be more than 25 percent smaller at 576 million.

Currently the total fertility rate in Africa still stands at 4.5 children per woman. It took 42 years (from 1972 to 2014) for global fertility to fall from 4.5 to 2.5 children. The UN projects that for Africa it will take longer than that â€“ 56 years (from 2016 to 2072) â€“ while the WC-IIASA researchers project a faster decline.

There are reasons to be optimistic that Africa could develop faster than the projections of the UN assume:

We know that falling mortality is associated with a decline of fertility. And health in Africa is improving:
â€“ The child mortality rate in Africa has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-around-the-world">halved over the last two decades</a>.
â€“ HIV/AIDS is still a serious threat, but the epidemic is past its peak and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-of-hiv-the-share-of-new-infections-among-the-previously-uninfected-population-ages-15-49?tab=chart&amp;country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa">incidence rate in Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by two thirds in the last 2 decades</a>.
â€“ Malaria too is in steep decline and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-malaria-deaths-by-world-region">annual number of deaths has almost halved in just the last 15 years</a>.

â€“ Crucially, education has also changed substantially across Africa: <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/10">The young generation is much better educated than older generations</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Share-primary-school-age-out-of-school?country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa+Middle%20East%20%26%20North%20Africa">the share of children out of school is falling rapidly</a>.
â€“ After decades of stagnation in many parts of Africa,Â  economies across the continent are now growing and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-in-extreme-poverty-by-world-region">the share of the population in extreme poverty is now falling</a>.

If you want to see more on how Africa is changing have a look at our slide show at <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/title-slide">AfricaInData.org</a>.

Still, living conditions in most parts of the African continent are very poor and it would be too early to say that the changes that we are seeing now are foreshadowing the improvements which will lower fertility rates rapidly. This will be determined only in the coming years, and the quantity and quality of education will be crucial as the visualization below shows. How quickly global population growth will slow will be decided by the chance of girls to go to school and the chances they have in life afterwards.

<h3 id="theworldpopulationbyeducationalstructure">The world population by educational structure</h3>
So what will be the result of these global demographic changes? The middle scenario by WC-IIASA for the educational structure of the world population is shown in the chart below.

We already know that the future population will be better educated than todayâ€™s population because in the vast majority of countries the younger cohorts are much better educated than the older cohorts.[ref]This can be also seen well in the scenarios that assume no further improvement in attainment such as the CER scenarios in the WC-IIASA projections.[/ref]

The projection also shows that we will likely not see a rapid increase in the number of children in the world â€“ we are likely not quite there yet, but the world is close to 'peak child'.

'Peak child' is a historic turning point in global demographic history â€“ after two centuries of rapid global population growth it will bring about the end of this era. And from the discussion of the various scenarios for the coming years we know that faster development â€“ the access to education for women in particular and further improvements of child health are especially important â€“ will mean that we are even closer to 'peak child'.

The 'gender pay gap' comes up often in <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-clinton-foundation-pays-top-wome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political debates</a>, <a href="https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/Complete-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy reports</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/26/football-gender-pay-gap-worse-than-in-politics-medicine-and-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyday news</a>. But what is it? What does it tell us? Is it different from country to country? How does it change over time?

In this blog post I try to answer these questions, providing an empirical overview of the gender pay gap across countries and over time. I've structured the analysis around six 'key facts'.

<strong> 1) The gender pay gap measures inequality but not necessarily discrimination</strong>

The gender pay gap (or the gender wage gap) is a metric that tells us the difference in pay (or wages, or income) between women and men. It's a measure of inequality and captures a concept that is broader than the concept of equal pay for equal work.

Differences in pay between men and women capture differences along many possible dimensions, including worker education, experience and occupation. When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male workers to all female workers â€“ irrespective of differences along these additional dimensions â€“ the result is the 'raw' or 'unadjusted' pay gap. On the contrary, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, etc., then the result is the 'adjusted' pay gap. The key facts below cover <em>unadjusted</em> measures of the gender pay gap. (You can read about the adjusted pay gap in our companion blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">here</a>.)

Discrimination in hiring practices can exist in the absence of pay gaps â€“ for example, if women know they will be treated unfairly and hence choose not to participate in the labor market. Similarly, it is possible to observe large pay gaps in the absences of discrimination in hiring practices â€“ for example, if women get fair treatment but apply for lower-paid jobs.

The implication is that observing differences in pay between men and women is neither necessary nor sufficient to prove discrimination in the workplace. Both discrimination and inequality are important. But they are not one and the same. (You can read about discrimination and 'equal pay for equal work' in our companion blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">here</a>).

<strong> 2) In most countries there is a substantial gender pay gap</strong>

Cross-country data on the gender pay gap is patchy, but the most complete source in terms of coverage is the United Nation's <em>International Labour Organization</em> (ILO). The following visualization presents this data. You can add observations by clicking on the option 'add country' at the bottom of the chart.

The estimates shown below correspond to differences between average hourly earnings of men and women (expressed as a percentage of average hourly earnings of men), and cover all workers irrespective of whether they work full time or part time.[ref]There are some exceptions to this definition. In particular, sometimes self-employed workers, or part-time workers are excluded. You can explore these exceptions using the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page30.jspx?_afrLoop=50047868615925&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D50047868615925%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D177i1q1z1w_130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation files containing all the relevant indicator notes.</a>[/ref]

As we can see: (i) in most countries the gap is positive â€“ women earn less than men; and (ii) there are large differences in the size of this gap across countries. Below we come back to these cross-country differences.

(NB. By this measure the gender wage gap can be positive or negative. If it is negative, it means that, on an hourly basis, men earn on average less than women. This happens in some countries, such as Malaysia.)

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo?country=CHE+URY+HTI+FRA+CRI+VNM+KOR+PAK+NOR+BRA+DNK+POL+RUS+COL+BEL+ESP" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>3) In most countries the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades</strong>

How is the gender pay gap changing over time? To answer this question, let's consider the following chart, showing available estimates from the OECD. These estimates include OECD member states, as well as some other non-member countries, and they are the longest available series of cross-country data on the gender pay gap that we are aware of.

Here we see that the gap is large in most OECD countries, but it has been going down in the last couple of decades. In some cases the reduction is remarkable. In the UK, for example, the gap went down from almost 50% in 1970 to about 17% in 2016.

These estimates are not directly comparable to those from the ILO, because the pay gap is measured slightly differently here: The OECD estimates refer to percent differences in <em>median</em> earnings (i.e. the gap here captures differences between men and women in the middle of the earnings distribution); and they cover only full-time employees and self-employed workers (i.e. the gap here excludes disparities that arise from differences in hourly wages for part-time and full-time workers).

However, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-2000-vs-2015"> ILO data shows similar trends for the period 2000-2015.</a>

The conclusion is that in most countries with available data, the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>4) The gender pay gap is larger for older workers</strong>

The <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Census Bureau</a> defines the pay gap as the ratio between median wages â€“ that is, they measure the gap by calculating the wages of men and women at the middle of the earnings distribution, and dividing them.

By this measure, the gender wage gap is expressed as a percent (median earnings of women as share of median earnings of men) and it is always positive. Here, values below 100% mean that women earn less than men, while values above 100% mean than women earn more. Values closer to 100% reflect a lower gap.

The next chart shows available estimates of this metric for full-time workers in the US, by age group.

First, we see that the series trends upwards, meaning the gap has been <em>shrinking</em> in the last couple of decades. Secondly, we see that there are important differences by age.

The second point is crucial to understand the gender pay gap: the gap is a statistic that changes during the life of a worker. In most rich countries, itâ€™s small when formal education ends and employment begins, and it increases with age. As we discuss in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">analysis of the determinants</a>, the gender pay gap tends to increase when women marry and when/if they have children.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/womens-weekly-earnings-as-a-percentage-of-mens-by-age-bureau-of-labor-statistics-2017" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong> 5) Women in rich countries tend to be overrepresented in the bottom of the income distribution â€“ and underrepresented at the top</strong>

Another way to look at cross-country gender inequalities in earnings is to focus on the share of women among low-pay earners. This is shown in the chart below. Here, 'low-pay' refers to workers earning less than two-thirds of the median (i.e. the middle) of the earnings distribution.

A share above 50% implies that women are 'overrepresented', in the sense that among those with low wages, there are more women than men.

The fact that women in rich countries are overrepresented in the bottom of the income distribution goes together with the fact that working women in these countries are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/us-women-are-overrepresented-in-low-wage-occupations">overrepresented in low-paying occupations</a>. This is also crucial to understand the pay gap: <a href="https://owid.cloud/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">occupational choice is a key contributor to the observed inequalities</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/female-share-of-low-pay-earners" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

A similar analysis at the opposite tail of the distribution is also insightful. The following chart shows, for the UK, the share of women at different brackets of the income distribution across time.

Here we can see that among those with high incomes, women are a minority in the UK. However, the representation of women at the top of the income distribution has been increasing over time.

Notice alsoÂ that the rate of increase in the proportion of high-income women in the UK is smaller within the very top income groups. This is usually interpreted as sign of the 'glass ceiling' in female earnings, and is actually a pattern that is observed in other countries too. In the US, for example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-gender-wage-ratio-in-different-income-percentiles">the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom</a>.

<strong>6) The gender pay gap is smaller in middle-income countries â€“ which tend to be countries with low labor force participation of women</strong>

The following scatter plot shows available ILO estimates on the gender pay gap (vertical axis) vs GDP per capita (on a logarithmic scale along the horizontal axis). As we can see there is a weak positive correlation between GDP per capita and the gender pay gap. However, the chart shows that the relationship is not really linear. Actually, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-banks-income-groups?year=2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">middle-income countries</a> tend to have the smallest pay gap.

The fact that middle-income countries have low gender wage gaps is, to a large extent, the result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-rates-by-national-per-capita-income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selection of women into employment</a>. Olivetti and Petrongolo (2008)[ref]Olivetti, C., &amp; Petrongolo, B. (2008). Unequal pay or unequal employment? A cross-country analysis of gender gaps. Journal of Labor Economics, 26(4), 621-654.[/ref] explain it as follows: â€œif women who are employed tend to have relatively highâ€wage characteristics, low female employment rates may become consistent with low gender wage gaps simply because lowâ€wage women would not feature in the observed wage distribution.â€

Olivetti and Petrongolo (2008) show that this pattern holds in the data: unadjusted gender wage gaps across countries tend to be negatively correlated with gender employment gaps. That is, <a href="https://owid.cloud/grapher/gender-gap-in-hourly-wages-vs-ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation">the gender pay gaps tend to be smaller where relatively fewer women participate in the labor force</a>.

So, rather than reflect greater equality, the lower wage gaps observed in some countries could indicate that only women with certain characteristics â€“ for instance, with no husband or children â€“ are entering the workforce.

But what does GDP actually tell us, and why is it increasingly seen as an incomplete and sometimes misleading measure of both economic activity and wellbeing? In this blog post, we answer this question and discuss a â€˜newâ€™, albeit historically older measure which is gaining traction as a much-needed supplement to GDP: national wealth.
<h3>What GDP does and doesn't tell us</h3>
So, what is GDP? GDP is a measure of economic activity â€“ in terms of market-based gross output â€“ in a given period (often a year). This is of course useful in many ways. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">GDP growth</a>, when captured accurately, has the potential to tell us about the pace of change and rising levels of consumption. Equally, a cessation of GDP growth can serve as an important red flag: stalling enterprises and increases in unemployed workers tend to imply hardship and losses in welfare.

However, there are important changes that GDP does not shed light on, and indeed might give us incorrect signals about. Think about climate change, a critical issue that has been increasingly under the international spotlight. An economy can increase its <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions</a> and drive up <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution/">local pollutants</a> â€“ both clearly harmful to the long-term wellbeing of the population â€“ while being rewarded with rising GDP figures. Similarly, a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes/">natural disaster</a> might harm people, destroy infrastructure, and require expensive emergency measures â€“ yet thanks to a rise in spending, this too would temporarily register as an increase in GDP. On the flip side, beneficial endeavors such as attempting to stall the alarming rate of biodiversity loss or deforestation not only fail to register in our headline statistic; they might slow its growth.

This is where wealth accounting comes in. Rather than measuring <em>flows</em>, as GDP does, wealth is an indicator of an economyâ€™s underlying capital <em>stocks</em>. Wealth, if measured in detail, accounts for the assets such as natural capital, produced capital, and human capital that underpin growth and consumption possibilities, and in this way shows us viable development pathways.[ref]According to the World Bank's definition and calculation of wealth, the underlying assets include: Natural capital (consisting of energy, minerals, agricultural land, protected areas, and forests), produced capital (consisting of machinery, structures, equipment and urban land), human capital (consisting of the knowledge, skills,and experience embodied in the workforce and calculated using the lifetime earnings approach), and net foreign assets (including portfolio equity, debt securities, foreign direct investment, and other financial capital held in other countries). For more details on the methodology, see the <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/dataset_resources/ddhfiles/public/Wealth%20Methodology%20-%20January%2030%2C%202018_4_0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] In the event of a natural disaster or rising <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution/">pollution</a>, for example, while GDP might grow, wealth measures would alert us to the depletion of underlying physical and natural capital stocks and the need for targeted investment. A detailed enough balance sheet would thus theoretically allow for the sustainable management of an economy's productive capital. Therefore, while GDP has little to say about whether a nationâ€™s assets can sustain current consumption levels into the future, wealth measures can tell us exactly this. The relationship between wealth and GDP is analogous to company accounts: the balance sheet of a company describes the stock of useful assets owned by a company (akin to wealth), while the profit and loss statement describes the flows of revenue, costs, and net income that the company has been able to generate using those assets (akin to GDP). Ultimately, the two measures are necessarily linked and best considered alongside each other.
<h3>Genuine saving: a measure of change in wealth</h3>
With the same logic described above, we can understand that current change to a countryâ€™s total wealth is linked to whether a countryâ€™s future consumption will lie above or below its current consumption level. Genuine saving (also known as â€œadjusted net savingâ€ or â€œcomprehensive investmentâ€) provides a measure of the change in wealth. If a countryâ€™s genuine saving is negative, this indicates that the country is consuming more than it is saving, thus eating into its capital stocks. If genuine saving is positive, the country is augmenting its wealth and theoretically improving its future prospects.

It is important, however, to emphasize that this measure of sustainability assumes perfect substitutability among different forms of capital. For example, a country can maintain the same level of genuine saving by depleting natural capital while simultaneously investing in produced capital. Yet this overlooks the fact that some natural capital that is essential to our existence on Earth â€“ such as productive soils, a stable climate, and functioning ecosystems â€“ face tipping points beyond which they cannot be easily restored. Fittingly, this type of assumption about substitutability underpins a concept often referred to as "weak sustainability". "Strong sustainability", on the other hand, focusses on the fact that natural capital cannot always be substituted for by other forms of capital.

With this important distinction in mind, let us consider existing measures of genuine saving.

Researchers Blum, Ducoing and McLaughlin (2017)[ref]Blum, Ducoing, McLaughlin. â€œA sustainable century? Genuine savings in developing and developed countries 1900-2000â€ in National Wealth: What is Missing, Why it Matters. Eds. Hamilton, K., &amp; Hepburn, C. Oxford University Press.[/ref] provide a view of the long-run development of genuine saving covering eleven countries over the span of the twentieth century. Their definition of genuine savings is as follows: Genuine Savings = net fixed produced capital formation and overseas investment + change in natural capital + education expenditure. Broadly speaking, their measure of saving accounts for changes in wealth in terms of the underlying produced, human, natural, and financial capital.

In the graph below, we see genuine saving plotted alongside GDP for the years 1900-2000 for the UK. You can compare countries by one or both of these measures by clicking "add country" at the bottom of the chart.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/genuine-saving-and-gdp-per-capita-in-international-dollars" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

In the above graph of the UK, we can make out some of the political and social developments of the 20th century reflected statistically. The effects of the Great Depression and Second World War register as dips in genuine saving, while GDP simultaneously grows. This is the case for other early-industrializing countries as well. Adding Switzerland to the chart, however, shows an anomaly â€“ as genuine saving declines across most European countries during the two World Wars, Switzerland experienced periods of large saving. This highlights the country's role as a haven for capital.

Interestingly, the time between the Great Depression and World War II also marks the moment in which GDP emerged as the foremost measure of the economy. Although its creators Simon Kuznets and Colin Clark intended to introduce an indicator that would inform us about welfare, wartime pressure took priority. GDP was thus developed as a way to calculate the extent to which people in an economy could be forced to divert efforts into wartime production.[ref]Coyle, D., 2015. GDP: A brief but affectionate history. Princeton University Press.[/ref] In this telling context, Kuznets warned that GDP would fail to make the distinction between the "quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and returns, and between the short and the long term".[ref]Simon Kuznets in: Herbert David Croly eds. (1962) The New Republic Vol. 147. p. 29: About rethinking the system of national accounting[/ref]

In the following chart, we can see a comparison of genuine saving across different countries over the 20th century.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/genuine-savings-per-capita-in-international-dollars-1900-2000" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

What does genuine saving look like in the years after 2000? The researchers responsible for producing the data presented above are currently working on expanding the dataset's country-coverage. In the interim, we can see estimates calculated using a different methodology from the World Bank. The below chart shows the World Bank's measure of Adjusted Net Saving (ANS), also an indicator of genuine saving, for the years 1970 to 2015.

<h3>Total and per capita wealth by asset-type</h3>
Now that we have considered the long-term evolution of <em>changes</em> in wealth, let us consider the latest figures of total and per capita wealth. As mentioned, this is by no means a new idea. As we examine the various forms of capital that make up an economy â€“ and which are only just now beginning to garner renewed attention â€“ let us keep in mind that wealth has a history longer than that of GDP. Think of Adam Smith's aptly named "The Wealth of Nations", originally published in 1776, and the statistician Robert Giffen, who examined stocks of capital as closely as flows of output in 1889.[ref]Giffen, R. (1889). The growth of capital. London: G. Bell.[/ref] Even the Victorians, who 150 years ago constructed much of the physical capital that we continue to rely upon today, could intuit the lasting impact of capital stocks.

The data visualized below draws on figures just released by the World Bank, who have been at the forefront of developing the methodology and accounting practices behind modern-day wealth accounts. Their newly revised methodology measures wealth from the "bottom-up", calculating the separate value of four asset groups â€“ natural capital, produced capital, human capital, and net foreign assets â€“ which together account for the majority of national wealth.[ref]The metric is nonetheless an evolving measure, and is not necessarily completely inclusive in its scope at present. Other forms of capital that are not captured but are currently being researched include social and institutional capital as well as ecosystem services.[/ref] Each of these asset groups is measured, where possible, as the net present value of the stream of future returns. This approach intends to capture the lifetime value of an asset, thus allowing us to examine assets, income, and consumption within a framework linking them to future sustainability. The most important improvement to this set of wealth accounts is the inclusion of human capital, calculated as the discounted value of lifetime earnings.

The chart below shows total wealth per capita by country groupings based on income level. We can see that average per capita wealth across the world grew from $130,032 to $169,349 â€“ or a rate of 1.3 percent per year â€“ between 1995 and 2014. This signals an overall gradually increasing asset base, however it also contains differences in wealth accumulation between rich and poor countries. Over the last twenty years, the concentration of wealth among high income countries fell as middle income countries â€“ and most notably upper middle income countries â€“ increased their share of global wealth. Low income countries, however, held on to only 1% of global wealth in 2014, about the same share as in 1995.

By breaking down total wealth into its underlying asset groups, we can see that human capital holds the largest share of global wealth in 2014, at 65% of all wealth. Notably, this figure fell from 69% in 1995 â€“ a development which the World Bank attributes to the steep decline after 2000 in the shares of human capital in high and upper middle income countries. This decline is in turn a result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">rapidly aging labor forces</a> and slumping real wages (especially in high-income OECD countries). Still, according to the World Bank, human capital is the largest component of wealth in all but low income countries, where the value of natural capital exceeds that of human capital. Among all income groups except high income non-OECD countries, we see that net foreign assets are negative. This implies the role of oil-producers as net creditors to the world.[ref]Forthcoming: World Bank (2018). The Changing Wealth of Nations.[/ref] You can compare the asset breakdown of total wealth for various country groupings by clicking on "change country" in the bottom of the chart.

Some asset groups can be further broken down into sub-components. This is particularly useful for examining natural capital in individual countries â€“ and especially so in countries with larger shares of natural capital. A breakdown of natural capital allows us to distinguish between renewable assets such as forests, and non-renewable ones such as fossil fuels. Below we can see that Saudi Arabia is unsurprisingly highly dependent on fossil energy resources.

Notably, natural capital accounts currently fall short of capturing aspects of nature â€“ such as biodiversity â€“ that have been in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6206/241.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatic decline</a>. To attempt to address this pressing issue, various groups are exploring the <a href="https://www.wavespartnership.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valuation of ecosystem services</a>.

The newly released data from the World Bank is an important step toward statistical measures that shed light on material wellbeing and our ability to sustain it. As wealth gains traction in public thinking â€“ it was recently featured in <a href="http://global-perspectives.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/making-the-future-count.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the winning entry of the Indigo Prize</a>, and has been a prominent aspect of other proposals to reform economic measurement[ref]See for example recommendation 3 of the influential Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress: "Consider income and consumption jointly with wealth" pg. 24, available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/118025/118123/Fitoussi+Commission+report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref] â€“ we may hope to see country statistical agencies releasing wealth data alongside GDP data. The implications of such widespread adoption could be big. Focusing on wealth as the primary measure of the economy would mean a complete recasting of the way we determine progress: one that finally shifts away from growth-at-all-costs and pays attention to our future.";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"The missing economic measure: Wealth";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:35:"the-missing-economic-measure-wealth";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-03-26 16:36:55";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-26 15:36:55";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=15663";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:6;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"15795";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"17";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-14 11:50:47";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-14 11:50:47";s:12:"post_content";s:15976:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in ourÂ new entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Causes of Death</a></strong>.</div>
The world has changed considerably over the last few centuries â€” this is what Our World in Data shows. One thing however has remained constant through this transition: we all have to die sometime. However, the <em>causes</em> of death are changingÂ as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">living standards improve</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare">healthcare advances</a>, and lifestyles change.

In this blog we attempt to answer the question 'what do people die from?', first by looking at the data on global causes of death followed by a selection of country-level examples. The leading causes of death across the world still vary significantly â€” we have therefore picked a selection of countries which highlight this heterogeneity.

First, let's start with the question: 'what does the world die from?'
<h3>Global deaths</h3>
In 2016, around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-age-group">55 million</a> people died â€“ nearly half of these were aged 70 years or older; 27% aged 50-69; 15% aged 15-49; only 1% aged 5-14; and around 10% were children under the age of 5. In the chart below we see a breakdown of global deaths by cause, ordered from highest to lowest. This is shown in absolute numbers, and each cause as a share of total deaths. Note that this list is not exhaustive: deaths from less common causes are not shown. You can also the causes of death for any country by clicking on the chart to get to the interactive version of this chart and then chosing 'Change country'.

The leading global killer in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which refer to aÂ <a href="https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/about_cvd/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of diseases</a>Â that affect the heart and blood vessels: These include hypertension (high blood pressure); coronary heart disease (heart attack); cerebrovascular disease (stroke); heart failure; and other heart diseases. Cardiovascular diseases killed 17.6 million people â€“ around one-third of all deaths.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-people-in-the-world-die-from-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cancers</a> (given as the sum of all cancer types â€” you can find the breakdown <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#cancer-deaths-by-type">here</a>) were the second largest, claiming around 9 million (16 percent or every sixth death globally).

Rounding off the top four were respiratory and diabetes-related diseases. Collectively, these are known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs): together they accounted for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#causes-of-death-in-recent-decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 39 million deaths</a> (more than 70 percent) in 2016.

There are a number of causes with high death tolls which if not entirely preventable can be (and have been in many countries) dramatically reduced. More than 1.7 million newborns still died due to complications at birth. The very low neonatal death rates in high-income countries and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/neonatal-mortality-rate?tab=chart&amp;country=CRI+PSE+DEU+IND+CHN">significant progress</a> across the world in recent decades is testament to the fact that we know how to reduce such tragedies significantly. Similarly, diarrheal diseasesÂ â€” which claimed 1.7 million people in 2016 and is one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 years oldÂ â€” are also <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preventable and treatable</a>Â through improved <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water, sanitation, hygiene</a>, and simple 'oral rehydration salt' (ORS) packets. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria">Malaria</a> has been successfully eliminated in some regions, and should with time be possible to eradicate; nonetheless, the IHME's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates that more than 700,000 still died from malaria in 2016.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#road-accidents">Road incidents</a> fall within the top ten causes of death, claiming 1.3 million in 2016.

Surprising to some is that the number who die from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suicide</a> is more than double that of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/homicides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homicide</a> at a global level. In fact, the number of deaths from suicides is higher than the number of deaths from all forms of violence â€“ including homicide, terrorism, conflict, and executions â€“ globally and across many countries across the world. You can see this relationship <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/suicide-vs-violent-deaths">here</a>. As Yuval Noah Harari notes in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/yuval_noah_harari_nationalism_vs_globalism_the_new_political_divide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his TED Dialogue</a>: <em>"Statistically you are your own worst enemy. At least, of all the people in the world, you are most likely to be killed by yourself"</em>.

At the bottom of the list we see deaths from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural disasters</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terrorist attacks</a>. Whilst the relative risk from such events is typically low, we must take care when using annual statistics in this case.Â Death rates related to disease, illness and other health factors tend to change relatively slowly over time. Natural disaster and terrorism-related deaths are different: they can vary substantially from one year to the next. This can make the annual comparison of deaths between health-related factors and volatile events more challenging and assessing the relative risk of these events can require a longer-term overview of high and low-mortality years. We cover discussion and analysis on this topic in a blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata/org/is-it-fair-to-compare-terrorism-and-disaster-with-other-causes-of-death">here</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>United States</h3>
What do people in the United States die from? In the chart below we see its breakdown of deaths in 2016.

Compared with the global data, a larger share of deaths is caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs)Â â€” accounting for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-number-of-deaths-by-cause?stackMode=relative&amp;country=USA">almost 90 percent</a> of mortality â€” and much lower occurrence of preventable deaths such as diarrheal disease, undernutrition, and neonatal deaths. This is a common pattern across high-income countries: prosperity, high living standards, good healthcare systems (although there areÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/the-link-between-life-expectancy-and-health-spending-us-focus">large inequalities in healthcare</a> access in the US when compared with other rich countries) have seen a successful decline in largely preventable mortality risks.

The majority of deaths in high-income countries therefore relate to to so-called 'lifestyle diseases', including NCDs, kidney, liver, and digestive diseases, or those which typically occur in older age (such as Alzheimer's and other dementias). This major shift in causes of death towards NCDs represents the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiological_transition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epidemiological Transition</a>Â which marks the transition from infectious diseases towards more chronic conditions. We see this process in the United States by looking at the shift in mortalityÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/twentieth-century-of-deaths-us?stackMode=relative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">across the 20th century</a>.Â Leading <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors">risk factors</a> for death in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor?country=USA">United States</a> are therefore now strongly linked to lifestyle choices such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smoking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smoking</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/obesity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obesity</a>, blood sugar, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dietary intake</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-alcohol-consumption-per-capita-litres-of-pure-alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcohol consumption</a>.

Suicides in the United States rank highly on the list of mortality causesÂ â€” above deaths from road accidents, and more than 2.5 times the number from homicides.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016?country=USA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Germany</h3>
Germany â€” again representative of a rich country with high living standards â€” shows a similar pattern to that of the United States. Leading causes of deaths are dominated by NCDs, dementia, and diseases related to the liver, kidney or digestive systems. Two thirds of all deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

An interesting distinction between Germany and the United States is its relative tally of road deaths. Road-related deaths in Germany ranked much lower than in the United States (0.5 percent versus 1.6 percent of deaths); in fact, more people died from alcoholism, and from diarrheal diseases in Germany than from road accidents. Homicide deaths are also very low â€” much lower than in the United States (0.07 versus 0.7 percent in the US). This creates an even greater disparity between suicide and violent deaths: around 17 times as many people died from suicide in 2016 than from violence.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016?country=DEU" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Brazil</h3>
Brazil provides an interesting contrast to the low homicide rates we see in Germany. As we see in the chart below, homicide ranks 7th in terms of the leading causes of death, claiming around 60,000 lives (4.6 percent of all deaths) in 2016. Like much of Latin America, the number of homicides <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/suicide-vs-violent-deaths">greatly outnumber</a> deaths from suicide. In Brazil, around four times as many people died from violence than from suicide.

Brazil, having experienced impressive <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/real-gdp-per-capita-PWT?country=BRA">economic growth</a>Â in recent decades, now holds a middle position in terms of its distribution of mortality causes. Like the United States and Germany, Brazil's leading causes of death are NCDs and dementia. Causes of death which we might term 'largely preventable' such as diarrheal disease, and newborn complications lie within the mid-range of causes; they are not dominant, but remain significant. We would expect that with continued development, their significance would continue to fall.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016?country=BRA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>South Africa</h3>
South Africa is one of theÂ few countries where cardiovascular disease is not the leading cause of death. Since the late 1990s, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids">HIV/AIDS</a> has been the leading cause of death in South Africa, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-hiv-by-age?country=ZAF">reaching a peak</a> of over 350,000 deaths per year in over 2006-2008. Since then, HIV-related deaths have more than halved, but the disease still remains the country's largest killer in 2016 at 164,000 (close to one-third of deaths). This is more than double the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease.

South Africa is not alone. HIV/AIDS remains the leading cause of death across several of its neighbours including Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and Malawi.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016?country=ZAF" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Kenya</h3>
Working with data on global development one comes across a lot of very sad facts about the world. Still, there are some I find so shocking that they are impossible to forget. The leading cause of death in Kenya is diarrheal disease, claiming around 50,000 (almost 20 percent) in 2016 alone. Improving basic infrastructure related to clean drinking <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">water, sanitation, and hygiene</a>, as well as improving healthcare services related to the treatment of diarrheal diseases will be crucial for Kenya (and similar countries with high mortality rates) to tackle such preventable deaths.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016?country=KEN" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Iraq</h3>
In our global view of causes of death â€” and for all of the country-level examples above â€” <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terrorism-related deaths</a> tend to rank very low.[ref]Note that we look at the volatility of terrorism and natural disaster deaths in more detail in our blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata/org/is-it-fair-to-compare-terrorism-and-disaster-with-other-causes-of-death">here.</a>[/ref] This is not the case everywhere. Whilst terror-related deaths have remained relatively low across the West, they have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fatalities-from-terrorism?country=East%20Asia+Eastern%20Europe+Middle%20East%20%26%20North%20Africa+North%20America+RUS+South%20America+South%20Asia+Sub-Saharan%20Africa+Western%20Europe">been increasing</a> across the Middle East, North Africa, and to a lesser extent South Asia.

For a number of countries across the Middle East in particular, terrorist-related and conflict deaths can be high on the list of leading causes. In the chart below we see death statistics for Iraq in 2016. Here we see that conflict and terrorism rank 5th and 6th respectively, with more than 11 percent of deaths combined. Whilst terror statistics at a global level suggests a low incidence of death, in some regions the odds are much more cruel.

This blog post is closely related to a companion article where we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/six-facts-pay-gap">definitions and trends in the gender pay gap</a>. It is also related to our articles exploring female labor force participation <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/female-labor-force-participation-key-facts">trends</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">determinants</a>.

<em>This blog post benefitted greatly from research contributions provided by <strong>Sandra Tzvetkova.</strong></em></div>

In almost all countries, if you compare the wages of men and women you find that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo">women tend to earn less than men.</a>Â These inequalities have been narrowing across the world. In particular, over the last couple of decades <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA">most high-income countries have seen sizeable reductions in the gender pay gap</a>.

I provide a thorough description of these facts in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/six-facts-pay-gap">companion blog post</a>. Here I want to focus on the determinants of the gender pay gap: How did these reductions come about and why do substantial gaps remain?

Before we get into the details, here is a preview of the main points.
<ul>
 	<li>An important part of the reduction in the gender pay gap in rich countries over the last decades is due to a historical narrowing, and often even reversal of the <em>education</em> gap between men and women.</li>
 	<li>Today, education is relatively unimportant to explain the remaining gender pay gap in rich countries. In contrast, the <em>characteristics of the jobs</em> that women tend to do, remain important contributing factors.</li>
 	<li>The gender pay gap is not a direct metric of discrimination. However, evidence from different contexts suggests <em>discrimination</em> is indeed important to understand the gender pay gap. Similarly, <em>social norms</em> affecting the gender distribution of labor are important determinants of wage inequality.</li>
 	<li>On the other hand, the available evidence suggests differences in psychological attributes and non-cognitive skills are at best modest factors contributing to the gender pay gap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences in human capital</h3>
<strong> The adjusted pay gap</strong>

Differences in earnings between men and women capture differences across many possible dimensions, including education, experience and occupation.

For example, if we consider that more educated people tend to have higher earnings, it is natural to expect that the narrowing of the pay gap across the world can be partly explained by the fact that women have been catching up with men in terms of educational attainment, in particular years of schooling.

The following chart plots female-to-male ratios of average years of schooling by world regions. It shows the historical narrowing, and sometimes even reversal of the education gap between men and women. (You can read more about this in our entry on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education">Global Rise of Education</a>.)

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-ratios-for-mean-years-of-schooling" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Since differences in education partly contribute to explain differences in wages, it is common to distinguish between 'unadjusted' and 'adjusted' pay differences.

When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male and female workers, irrespective of differences in worker characteristics, the result is the raw or <em>unadjusted</em> pay gap. In contrast to this, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, and other factors that matter for the pay gap, then the result is the <em>adjusted</em> pay gap.

The idea of the adjusted pay gap is to make comparisons within groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education. This allows us to tease out the extent to which different factors contribute to observed inequalities.

The following chart, from Blau and Kahn (2017)[ref]Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available online <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. [/ref] shows the evolution of the adjusted and unadjusted gender pay gap in the US.

More precisely, the chart shows the evolution of female to male wage ratios in three different scenarios: (i) Unadjusted; (ii) Adjusted, controlling for gender differences in human capital, i.e. education and experience; and (iii) Adjusted, controlling for a full range of covariates, including education, experience, job industry and occupation, among others. The difference between 100% and the full specification (the green bars) is the â€œunexplainedâ€ residual.[ref]For each specification, Blau and Kahn (2017) perform regression analyses on data from the PSID (the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics), which includes information on labor-market experience and considers men and women ages 25-64 who were full-time, non-farm, wage and salary workers. [/ref]

Several points stand out here.

 	<li>First, the unadjustedÂ gender pay gap in the US shrunk over this period.Â This is evident from the fact that the blue bars are closer to 100% in 2010 than in 1980.</li>
 	<li>Second, if we focus on groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education, we also see a narrowing.Â The adjusted gender pay gap has shrunk.</li>
 	<li>Third, we can see that education and experience used to help explain a very large part of the pay gap in 1980, but this changed substantially in the decades that followed. This third point follows from the fact that the difference between the blue and red bars was much larger in 1980 than in 2010.</li>
 	<li>And fourth, the green bars grew substantially in the 1980s, but stayed fairly constant thereafter. In other words: Most of the convergence in earnings occurred during the 1980s, a decade in which the "unexplained" gap shrunk substantially.</li>
</ul>

Blau and Kahn further break down the wage gap into contributing factors. The following chart shows the relative importance of specific labor market characteristics in 1980 and 2010.

Now we see that in the US, education and experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages over time, while occupation and industry have become more important.[ref]In 2010, unionization and education show negative values; this reflects the fact that women have surpassed men in educational attainment, and unionization in the US has been in general decline with a greater effect on men.[/ref]

<strong>How to interpret the 'unexplained residual'?</strong>

The chart above shows that the 'unexplained' residual went down over the period 1980-2010. This means the observable characteristics of workers and their jobs explain wage differences better today than a couple of decades ago. At first sight, this seems like good news â€“ it suggests that today there is less discrimination, in the sense that differences in earnings are today much more readily explained by differences in 'productivity' factors. But is this really the case?

The unexplained residual may include aspects of unmeasured productivity (i.e. unobservable worker characteristics that cannot be controlled for in a regression), while the "explained" factors may themselves be vehicles of discrimination.

For example, suppose that women are indeed discriminated against, and they find it hard to get hired for certain jobs simply because of their sex. This would mean that in the adjusted specification, we would see that occupation and industry are important contributing factors â€“ but that is precisely because discrimination is embedded in occupational differences!

Hence, while the unexplained residual gives us a first-order approximation of what is going on, we need much more detailed data and analysis in order to say something definitive about the role of discrimination in observed pay differences. I will discuss the evidence on discrimination further below.
<h3>Looking beyond worker characteristics</h3>
<strong>Job flexibility</strong>

All over the world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-to-male-ratio-of-time-devoted-to-unpaid-care-work">women tend to do more unpaid care work at home than men</a> â€“ and women tend to be overrepresented in low paying jobs where they have the flexibility required to attend to these additional responsibilities.

The most important evidence regarding this link between the gender pay gap and job flexibility is presented and discussed by Claudia Goldin in the article '<a href="http://econweb.umd.edu/~davis/eventpapers/GoldinConvergence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter</a>', where she digs deep in the data from the US.[ref]Goldin, C. (2014). A grand gender convergence: Its last chapter. The American Economic Review, 104(4), 1091-1119.[/ref] There are some key lessons that apply both to rich and non-rich countries.

Goldin shows that when one looks at the data on occupational choice in some detail, it becomes clear that women disproportionately seek jobs, including full-time jobs, that tend to be compatible with childrearing and other family responsibilities. In other words, women, more than men, are expected to have temporal flexibility in their jobs. Things like shifting hours of work and rearranging shifts to accommodate emergencies at home. And these are jobs with lower earnings per hour, even when the total number of hours worked is the same.

The importance of job flexibility in this context is very clearly illustrated by the fact that, over the last couple of decades, women in the US increased their participation and remuneration in only some fields. In a recent paper, Goldin and Katz (2016)[ref]Goldin, C., &amp; Katz, L. F. (2016). A most egalitarian profession: pharmacy and the evolution of a family-friendly occupation. Journal of Labor Economics, 34(3), 705-746. Available online <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/jole_gk_pharm_published.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] show that pharmacy became a highly remunerated female-majority profession with a small gender earnings gap in the US, at the same time as pharmacies went through substantial technological changes that made flexible jobs in the field more productive (e.g. computer systems that increased the substitutability among pharmacists.)

The chart below shows how quickly female wages increased in pharmacy, relative to other professions, over the last few decades in the US.

<strong>The motherhood penalty</strong>

Closely related to job flexibility and occupational choice, is the issue of work interruptions due to motherhood. On this front there is again a great deal of evidence in support of the so-called 'motherhood penalty'.

Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017)[ref]Lundborg, P., Plug, E., &amp; Rasmussen, A. W. (2017). Can Women Have Children and a Career? IV Evidence from IVF Treatments. American Economic Review, 107(6), 1611-1637.[/ref] provide evidence from Denmark â€“ more specifically, Danish women who sought medical help in achieving pregnancy.

By tracking womenâ€™s fertility and employment status through detailed periodic surveys, these researchers were able to establish that women who had a successful <em>in vitro fertilization</em> treatment, ended up having lower earnings down the line than similar women who, by chance, were unsuccessfully treated.

Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen summarise their findings as follows: "Our main finding is that women who are successfully treated by [in vitro fertilization] earn persistently less because of having children. We explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older. We explain the decline in hourly earnings, which is often referred to as the motherhood penalty, by women moving to lower-paid jobs that are closer to home."

The fact that the motherhood penalty is indeed about â€˜motherhoodâ€™ and not â€˜parenthoodâ€™, is supported by further evidence. 

<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24219#fromrss">A recent study</a>, also from Denmark, tracked men and women over the period 1980-2013, and found that after the first child, womenâ€™s earnings sharply dropped and never fully recovered. But this was not the case for men with children, nor the case for women without children.

These patterns are shown in the chart below.  The first panel shows the trend in earnings for Danish women with and without children. The second panel shows the same comparison for Danish men.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Impacts-of-Children-on-earnings-Denmark.png"><img src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Impacts-of-Children-on-earnings-Denmark-750x378.png" alt="" width="750" height="378" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16829" /></a>

Note that these two examples are from Denmark â€“ a country that <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/data">ranks high on gender equality measures </a> and where <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/are-mothers-guaranteed-an-equivalent-position-after-maternity-leave">there are legal guarantees requiring that a woman can return to the same job after taking time to give birth.</a>

This shows that, although <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257%2Fjep.12.1.137">family-friendly policies contribute to improve female labor force participation and reduce the gender pay gap</a>, they are only part of the solution. Even when there is generous paid leave and subsidized childcare, as long as mothers disproportionately take additional work at home after having children, inequities in pay are likely to remain.

<strong>Ability, personality and social norms</strong>

The discussion so far has emphasised the importance of job characteristics and occupational choice in explaining the gender pay gap. This leads to obvious questions: What determines the systematic gender differences in occupational choice? What makes women seek job flexibility and take a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work?

One argument usually put forward is that, to the extent that biological differences in preferences and abilities underpin gender roles, they are the main factors explaining the gender pay gap. In their review of the evidence, Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (2017)[ref]Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available online <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] show that there is limited empirical support for this argument.

To be clear, yes, there is evidence supporting the fact that men and women differ in some key attributes that may affect labor market outcomes. For example standardised tests show that there are <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> statistical gender gaps in maths scoresÂ in some countries</a>; and experiments show that women <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid more salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show particular predisposition to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotion potential</a>. However, these observed differences are far from being biologically fixed â€“ 'gendering' begins early in life and the evidence shows that preferences and skills are highly malleable. You can influence tastes, and you can certainly teach people to tolerate risk, to do maths, or to negotiate salaries.

What's more, independently of where they come from, Blau and Kahn show that these empirically observed differences can typically only account for a modest portion of the gender pay gap.

In contrast, the evidence does suggest that social norms and culture, which in turn affect preferences, behaviour and incentives to foster specific skills, are key factors in understanding gender differences in labor force participation and wages. You can read more about this in our blog post dedicated to answer the question <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap">'How well do innate gender differences explain the gender pay gap?'</a>.

<strong>Discrimination and bias</strong>

Independently of the exact origin of the unequal distribution of gender roles, it is clear that our recent and even current practices show that these roles persist with the help of institutional enforcement. Goldin (1988),[ref]Goldin, C. (1988). Marriage bars: Discrimination against married women workers, 1920's to 1950's. Available <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w2747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] for instance, examines past prohibitions against the training and employment of married women in the US. She touches on some well-known restrictions, such as those against the training and employment of women as doctors and lawyers, before focusing on the lesser known but even more impactful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'marriage bars'</a> which arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s.Â These work prohibitions are important because they applied to teaching and clerical jobs â€“ occupations that would become the most commonly held among married women after 1950. Around the time the US entered World War II, it is estimated that 87% of all school boards would not hire a married woman and 70% would not retain an unmarried woman who married.

The map shown below highlights that to this day, explicit barriers across the world limit the extent to which women are allowed to do the same jobs as men.[ref]The data in this map, which comes from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, provides a measure of whether there are any specific jobs that non-pregnant and non-nursing women are not allowed to perform. So, for example, a country might be coded as "No" if women are only allowed to work in certain jobs within the mining industry, such as health care professionals within mines, but not as miners.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/can-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-do-the-same-jobs-as-men" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

However, even after explicit barriers are lifted and legal protections put in their place, discrimination and bias can persist in less overt ways. Goldin and Rouse (2000),[ref]Goldin, C., &amp; Rouse, C. (2000). Orchestrating impartiality: The impact of" blind" auditions on female musicians. <em>American Economic Review</em>, 90(4), 715-741. Available <a href="http://affectfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Goldin-Rouse-AER-2000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] for example, look at the adoption of "blind" auditions by orchestras, and show that by using a screen to conceal the identity of a candidate, impartial hiring practices increased the number of women in orchestras by 25% between 1970 and 1996.

Many other studies have found similar evidence of bias in different labor market contexts.[ref]Blau and Kahn (2017) provide a whole list of experimental studies that have found labor-market discrimination. Another early example is from Neumark et al. (1996), who look at discrimination in restaurants. In this case male and female pseudo-job-seekers were given similar CVs to apply for jobs waiting on tables at the same set of restaurants in Philadelphia. The results showed discrimination against women in high-priced restaurants.

The full reference of this study is Neumark, D., Bank, R. J., &amp; Van Nort, K. D. (1996). Sex discrimination in restaurant hiring: An audit study. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 111(3), 915-941.[/ref]

Biases also operate in other spheres of life with strong knock-on effects on labor market outcomes. For example, at the end of World War II <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/what-percentage-of-the-us-public-approves-of-working-wives">only 18% of people in the US thought that a wife should work if her husband was able to support her</a>. This obviously circles back to our earlier point about social norms.
<h3>Policy implications</h3>
In many countries wage inequality between men and women can be reduced by improving the education of women. However, in many countries gender gaps in education have been closed and we still have large gender inequalities in the workforce. What else can be done?

An obvious alternative is fighting discrimination. But the evidence presented above shows that this is not enough. Public policy and management changes on the firm level matter too:

Family-friendly labor-market policies may help. For example, maternity leave coverage can contribute by raising womenâ€™s retention over the period of childbirth, which in turn raises womenâ€™s wages through the maintenance of work experience and job tenure.[ref]Waldfogel, J. (1998). Understanding the "family gap" in pay for women with children. The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 12(1), 137-156.[/ref]

Similarly, early education and childcare can increase the labor force participation of women â€” and reduce gender pay gapsÂ â€” by alleviating the unpaid care work undertaken by mothers.[ref]Olivetti, C., &amp; Petrongolo, B. (2017). The economic consequences of family policies: lessons from a century of legislation in high-income countries. The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31(1), 205-230.[/ref]

Additionally, the experience of women's historical advance in specific professions (e.g. pharmacists in the US), suggests that the gender pay gap could also be considerably reducedÂ if firms did not have the incentive to disproportionately reward workers who work long hours, and fixed, non-flexible schedules.[ref]Goldin, C. (2014). A grand gender convergence: Its last chapter. The American Economic Review, 104(4), 1091-1119. Available online <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] Changing these incentives is of course difficult because it requires reorganizing the workplace. But it is likely to have a large impact on gender inequality, particularly in countries where other measures are already in place.[ref]As we show above, in several nations, such as Sweden and Denmark, a â€œmotherhood penaltyâ€ in earnings exists, even though these nations have generous family policies, including paid family leave and subsidized child care.[/ref]

Implementing these strategies can have a positive self-reinforcing effect. For example, family-friendly labor-market policies that lead to higher labor-force attachment and salaries for women, will raise the returns to women's investment in education â€“ so women in future generations will be more likely to invest in education, which will also help narrow gender gaps in labor market outcomes down the line.[ref]For a discussion of this mechanism, see page 814, Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available online <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. [/ref]

Nevertheless, powerful as these strategies may be, they are only part of the solution. Social norms and culture remain at the heart of family choices and the gender distribution of labor. Achieving equality in opportunities requires ensuring that we change the norms and stereotypes that limit the set of choices available both to men and women. It is difficult, but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evidence</a> shows that social norms, too, can be changed.";s:10:"post_title";s:30:"Why is there a gender pay gap?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:30:"what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-02-19 16:42:07";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-19 16:42:07";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=15918";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16001";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"14";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-03-22 15:00:06";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-22 15:00:06";s:12:"post_content";s:9875:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.</div>
Recently, we published a comprehensive <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">dataset of famine mortality</a> over the last 150 years â€“ the outcome ofÂ several months' work that brings together a range of sources on particular famines into one place. In this post we show that, despite the uncertainty that surrounds mortality estimates for many individual famines, the overall long-run trend is clear: in recent decades famine mortality rates have fallen abruptly to much lower levels compared to earlier periods. In aÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-far-fewer-people-die-in-famines-today">second blog</a>, we discuss some of the reasons for this decline.
<h3>Victims of individual famines</h3>
The following chart showsÂ the estimated number of people dying in individual famines since the 1860s, based on our dataset which can be found at the bottom of our main entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.Â The length of each line shows the duration of the famine and the color shows the continent in which the famine occurred.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-number-of-famine-victimes-for-each-famine-revised.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17389" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-number-of-famine-victimes-for-each-famine-revised-750x527.png" alt="" width="750" height="527" /></a>

&nbsp;

What this chart doesn't show however is the significant uncertainty that surrounds many of these estimates. As we discuss in our section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#data-quality-definition">Data Quality</a>, historical famine estimates are frequently based on very scant demographic information, and even where such evidence is available there is still disagreement in its interpretation.

As such, many of the famines included in our dataset are associated with a wide range of plausible mortality estimates. In our data, these are represented by upper- and lower-bound estimates, with the mid-point being shown in the visualization above. Two apt examples, discussed in more detail in the notes at the bottom of this post, are the famines inÂ the Democratic Republic of Congo, which took place amidst the Second Congo War beginning in 1998, and that of North Korea from 1995 to 1999. These faminesÂ stand out in recent decades for their particularly high mortality. But in both cases, the range of mortality estimates available in the literature is large, with high and low estimates varying by several millions of deaths.

Where such differences are present, our midpoint estimates are clearly very sensitive to our choice of upper and lower bounds. We have not simply taken the highest and lowest figures published in the public domain, given that more accurate estimates often emerge with time.Â As noted by theÂ <a href="http://fletcher.tufts.edu/World-Peace-Foundation/Program/Research/Mass-Atrocities-Research-Program/Mass-Famine#Dataset">World Peace Foundation</a>,Â <em>â€œgenerally speaking, better demographic calculations lead to lower estimations of excess deaths than those provided by journalists and other contemporary observers."Â </em>Rather, we have sought to select upper and lower estimates based on theÂ balance of opinion in commonly-cited sources, all of which are detailed (for each individual event) in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">dataset of famines</a>. Inevitably though, this meant us taking a position in some controversial cases, discussed in detailÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#some-controversial-mortality-estimates">here</a>.

&nbsp;
<h3>Long term trend in global famine mortality</h3>
Whilst the number of deaths caused by individual famines is often subject to a good deal of uncertainty, the overall trend over time is very clear: compared to earlier historical periods, far fewer people have died in famines in recent decades. Whether we consider high or lowÂ estimates, or something in between, does not affect this conclusion. Relative to the growing world population this trend is all the more notable. Below we show the rate of famine deaths globally, expressed as the number of people dying each year per 100,000 people of the world population, again based on our midpoint estimates for each famine. The chart presents this rate averaged across each decade since 1860. You can see that the famine mortality rate fell to very low levels over the second half of the 20th century onwards.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famine-death-rate-since-1860s-revised.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17387" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famine-death-rate-since-1860s-revised-750x527.png" alt="" width="750" height="527" /></a>
The geographic spread of famines has also reduced over this period, as we can see in the chart below. While in earlier periods Asia suffered heavily from major famines, this came to a halt over the mid-20th century. Since then, famines have almost exclusively been restricted to Africa, with the famine in North Korea being a stark exception.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famines-by-continent-and-ME-01.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17443" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famines-by-continent-and-ME-01-500x550.png" alt="" width="613" height="674" /></a>

&nbsp;

The sharp reduction in famine mortality represents "one of theÂ great unacknowledged triumphs of our lifetime", as famine researcher, Alex de Waal describes it.[ref]de Waal, A., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.09.004">The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action</a>, Political Geography (2017)[/ref] AÂ continued decline, however, is far from assured. As we consider in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-far-fewer-people-die-in-famines-today">second blog</a> though, the long-run developments that have contributed to the sharp decline in famine mortality do suggest that the type of catastrophic famine seen in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is unlikely to return.

The great disparity between these two estimates largely lies within the assumptions made about the number of people that would have died anyway in the absence of the Second Congo War, with the Human Security Report arguing that the IRC estimate adopts an overly optimistic counterfactual. So called 'excess mortality' estimates are always highly sensitive to the choice of baseline mortality rate, but this is particularly true for crises that extend across several years such that the counterfactual <em>trend</em> in mortality has to be considered also. They also argue that the survey data on which the IRC estimate is based is, for some periods at least, unrepresentative of the country as a whole â€“ a perennial issue in famine demography, given the typically patchy availability of data.

The number of people that died in the North Korean famine remains highly uncertain, largely due to the closed nature of the country. This has precluded access to official data and other channels of inquiry, such as surveys. Estimates range from the North Korean Government's 'quasi-official' estimate of 220,000 to the 3.5 million arrived at by South Korean NGO, <a href="http://goodfriends.or.kr/eng/">Good Friends Centre for Peace, Human Rights and Refugees</a>Â by extrapolating from interviews conducted with refugees fleeing the country.

More recent analyses have produced increasingly lower estimates, with a rough consensus that the sample of refugees upon which the 3.5 million figure was basedÂ â€“ people from areas so badly affected that they sought to emigrate â€“ was almost certainly unrepresentative of the country as a whole.[ref]See, for instance Ã“ GrÃ¡da <em>Famine: A Short HistoryÂ </em>(2009), p.94 and <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/Hunger_and_Human_Rights.pdf">Haggard and Noland (2005)</a>.[/ref]Â Both our upper and lower estimates are, instead, based on the authors' attempts to reconstruct demographic trends between censuses conducted in 1993 and 2008, again contrasted to an assumed counterfactual mortality rate.[ref]Â Ho Il Moon's estimate of 336,000 published in <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/how-big-north-korean-army-evidence-missing-population">a recent article for VOX</a>, also falls in this interval. Again it is based on reconstruction of intercensal demography.[/ref]

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famine</a>.</div>
In recent years, specific criteria have been agreed upon by the international humanitarian community for determining if a food crisis should be considered a <a href="https://owid.cloud/famines/">famine</a>. But given the range and complexity of food emergencies, the way in which famines, or potential famines, are discussed can still be quite unclear. In this post I look at two potentially confusing recent examples and, by considering in more detail how famines are classified, I try to clarify what's going on.
<h3>Famine in South Sudan in 2017</h3>
In February 2017, parts of South Sudan were officially declared by the UN as being in famine â€“ the first such declaration since 2011. By May the famine had apparently receded, thanks to an effective aid response that averted large-scale loss of life. And yet, the crisis was far from over. Indeed the overall food security situation in the country had, in fact, 'further deteriorated'Â over the same period, according to official reports[ref]IPC May 2017 communication, available <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_South_Sudan_AcuteFI_May2017_June-July2017.pdf">here</a>. Access 22 Jan 2018.[/ref]Â â€“ even as the 'famine' status was being withdrawn. Since then the situation has barely improved, with some 4.8 million people (45% of the population) expected to be severely food insecure as compared to 5.5 million back in May 2017.[ref]Comparing the the figure given in the IPC May communication with the <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-detail-forms/ipcinfo-map-detail/en/c/1052776/">September 2017 Key Messages</a> report, accessed 22 Jan 2018.[/ref]

So is the famine in South Sudan over or not?
<h3>'Largest humanitarian crisis' since 1945</h3>
Then in March 2017, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stephen O'Brian, stated that the combined emergencies in South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria represented the 'largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN', with some 20 million people being 'at risk of starvation'.[ref]The statement was made at the <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12748.doc.htm">7897th UN Security Council briefin</a>g. Article accessed 21 Jan 2018.[/ref]

The chart below shows the estimated number of people dying in individual famines since 1860 and provides some context for this statement. ItÂ is based on the table found at the end of our recently updated entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.Â The color of the line shows the continent in which the famine occurred. We can see that, were a mortality of the order of 20 million deaths to materialize, it would, as a combined figure, indeed rank as one of the most catastrophic famines in history, second only to the 'Great Leap Forward famine' in China in 1959-61.

But we also see that, since the second half of the twentieth century, catastrophic faminesÂ â€“ with mortalities in the millionsÂ â€“ have been much less frequent compared to earlier periods.[ref]The 'catastrophic' category comes from<em>Â Howe, P. &amp; Devereux, S. 2004. Famine intensity and magnitude scales: A proposal for an instrumental definition of famine. Disasters 28(4), 353â€“372.</em>

It should be noted that the mortality estimate for the famine in the Democratic Republic of Congo around the turn of the millennium is somewhat controversial, with estimates ranging from under one million to over five million deaths. See the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#some-controversial-mortality-estimates">Data Quality</a> section of the full entry on famines for more detail.[/ref] There are many contributing factors that explain the reduced number of famine casualties (discussed more in our entry onÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>), but most represent long-term trends, such as <a href="https://owid.cloud/health-meta/">improvements in public health</a>, access to markets and transport infrastructure. Taken together, they have reduced the structural vulnerability of populations to the kinds of mortality rates witnessed in earlier famines. As such, famine scholar Alex de Waal writes, <em>"even if all four countries [â€“ South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria â€“] do become famine-stricken, it is still very unlikely that levels of mortality will approach those in the calamitous famines of the mid-twentieth century."</em>[ref]deWaal, A., The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action, Political Geography (2017)[/ref]

The humanitarian crisis is, nonetheless,Â very real. But how should we understand the gravity of the present situation in the context of the past?

<h3>A closer look</h3>
In order to approach this question, and to get a better understanding of the crisis in South Sudan, it is helpful to look more closely at how different degrees of food insecurity, including famine, are categorized today.

<strong>Intensity vs. Magnitude</strong>

In declaring famines, the UN follows the <em>Integrated Food Security Phase Classification</em> (IPC) â€“ you find all details in theÂ IPC guidelines <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Guidelines_Nov16.pdf">here</a>, and the more generalÂ <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>.

The IPC lays out thresholds across three dimensions of outcomes, all of which must be evidenced in order for a famine to be declared in a certain area:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Food consumption and livelihood change:</strong> At least one in five householdsÂ faces an extreme lack of food, as evidenced by insufficient food consumption (in terms of quantity and/or quality) and by the coping strategies employed by or available to households (e.g. the extent to which assets like livestock or seed may have been sold off)</li>
 	<li><strong>Nutritional status:Â </strong>More than 30% of the population is suffering from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#too-little-weight-for-height-wasting">'wasting'</a> (being below 2 standard deviations below the median weight for a given height in the reference population)</li>
 	<li><strong>M</strong><strong>or</strong><strong>tality (due to inadequate food consumption)</strong>[ref]The <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>Â states that <em>"for both nutrition and mortality area outcomes, household food consumption deficits must be an explanatory factor in order for that evidence to be used in support of a Phase classification"</em>. Where, for instance, illness or conflict, unrelated to food consumption deficits, was the cause of mortality this should not be included in the Phase assessment. However, it is common for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#poor-health-and-infectious-diseases">poor health</a> or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#war-and-famines">conflict</a> to exacerbate the extent or impact of food consumption deficits. Mortality generated in such circumstance is counted.[/ref]<strong>:</strong> At least two people out ofÂ every 10,000Â and at least four children under five out of every 10,000 are dying per day.[ref]The key criterion is for the overall death rate to be above the 2/10,000 threshold. Where this is below the threshold level but the under five death rate is above its threshold, famine should only be declared following consultation with an 'Emergency Review Committee'. See IPC guidelines <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Guidelines_Nov16.pdf">here</a>, and the more generalÂ <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>, accessed 26 Jan 2018.[/ref]</li>
</ul>
A few things are worth noting about this definition. Firstly, these thresholds represent only the most severe rank of the IPC food insecurity classification. The system ranges from Phase 1 to Phase 5, with 5 corresponding to a famine situation. Lower phases of food insecurity are categorized by lower thresholds in each of the three dimensions above.

Secondly, it is important to see that such thresholds are a measure ofÂ <em>intensityÂ </em>rather thanÂ <em>magnitude</em>[ref]This distinction in famine classification was made in an influential paper by Paul Howe and Steven Devereux in 2004, see<em> Howe, P. &amp; Devereux, S. 2004. Famine intensity and magnitude scales: A proposal for an instrumental definition of famine. Disasters 28(4), 353â€“372.</em>[/ref]<em>.</em>Â That is to say, rather than trying to capture the absolute number of people in a certain situation of food insecurity, it looks at proportions within given geographic areas. Thus different assessments of food security trends will often be made depending on the geographic level of analysis. An amelioration at a very local level is perfectly compatible with an overall deterioration of the food security status of a country as whole. And this is exactly what happened in South Sudan over the course of 2017.

The first map below shows the IPC classification of each county of South Sudan in January 2017. It was the intensity of the food security situation in Unity State (in dark red colors), which brought about the famine declaration later in February, with IPC Phase 5 thresholds being confirmed in some parts.

In the second map below we can see that by May the situation in Unity State had somewhat abatedÂ due to humanitarian relief efforts, but the food security situation of most other parts of the country had deteriorated significantly. Thus while the 'famine' was overÂ <em>â€“</em> in the very particular sense of there being no area where intensity thresholds met Phase 5 criteriaÂ Â <em>â€“ </em>the food emergency had in fact become worse for most people.

<strong>Areas as a whole vs. individual households within an area</strong>

Just as different parts of a country can have different food security statuses, different households can, and typically do, experience different levels of food insecurity within any given geographic area. Rather than looking at geographical subdivisions, one way of getting a sense of how different people are faring in a food emergency is to look at the numbers of individual households experiencing different levels of food insecurity.

The IPC sets out such a 'Household Group Classification' alongside the 'Area Classification' outlined above. It mirrors the area classification in providing a Phase classification from 1 to 5, with 5 consisting of a 'Catastrophe' situation for the household. Since nutritional status and mortality data are typically collected for whole populations in a given area, only the food consumption and livelihood change dimension is used to categorize food security at the household levelÂ â€“ though signs of malnutrition or excess mortality within the household are used to confirm the presence of extreme food gaps at the higher insecurity rankings.[ref]The two classifications are linked by the fact that the categorization of households along this dimension forms the basis of the first threshold criterion of the area classification of food insecurity:Â <em>"A key criterion forÂ </em><em>the Area classification is that 20 percent of the population must be in that Phase or worse based onÂ </em><em>the Household Group classification".</em>[/ref]

So whilst the household-level classification considers fewer outcomes (only food deficits, as opposed to nutritional or mortality outcomes), it does allow for an assessment of the magnitude of a food emergency in terms of the absolute number of people being affected at different levels of severity. Looking at the household data for South Sudan over 2017 offers another angle on the evolution of the crisis. The two tables give the number of people estimated to be at a given level of insecurity across the different States in January (first table) and May (second table).

With such a disaggregation we can see that the humanitarian provision, targeted to the most in need in Unity State, did indeed bring down the number of people experiencing the very worst food insecurity. It was on this basis that that country was no longer officially 'in famine'. However, if we look at the number of individuals in Phase 3 (Crisis) or worse food insecurity, we see not only a deterioration in the country as a whole (45.2 % of the population in May compared to 32.3% in January), but even in Unity State itself (with 58.7% and 54.7% respectively).

Thus whilst a binary 'famine/no-famine' categorization is very useful in terms of being able to draw international attention and relief efforts to the most dire situations, there are other dimensions that we should be aware of in trying to get a sense of the gravity of a food crisis, particularly in terms of its magnitude.

<strong>Global outlook</strong>

The Household Group IPC classification can be used to get a sense of the sense of the scale of the food emergencies currently underway. The <a href="http://www.fews.net">Famine Early Warning Systems Network</a>Â (FEWS), for instance, publishes estimates for the number of people in need of emergency food assistance, defined as those experiencing, or imminently likely to experience Phase 3 ('Crisis') food insecurity or worse. This corresponds to households experiencing <em>"food consumption gaps with high or above usual acute malnutrition"</em> or thoseÂ <em>"marginally able to meet minimum food needs only with accelerated depletion of livelihood assets that will lead to food consumption gaps."Â </em>

And along this dimension, the numbers are, according to <a href="http://www.fews.net/global/alert/january-25-2017">FEWS</a>, 'unprecedented in recent decades'.[ref]See article <a href="http://www.fews.net/global/alert/january-25-2017">here</a>, accessed 27 Jan 2018. FEWS in fact later went on to increase its estimates for 2017 to 83 million, as shown in the bar chart.[/ref]

It is in this context that we should probably interpret Stephen O'Brien's statement last year that the world was facing the 'largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN'. The numbers estimated to be in need of emergency assistance in 2017, as defined by FEWS, did represent a peak in recent times[ref]This is based on FEWS' statement just cited. I was not able to find figures prior to 2015. It is important to note that the coverage of the FEWS analysis is not global, and the geographical coverage can change from year to year. The system looks at only those countries considered to be at risk of facing food crises. As such it may not capture some households experiencing similar levels of food insecurity in countries that are not within this scope.[/ref] â€“ and humanitarian needs are set to remain high in 2018. Largely due to ongoing conflicts, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria and, again, South Sudan all face a credible risk of famine during 2018 according to <a href="http://www.fews.net/global/alert/november-28-2017">FEWS</a>.

<strong>Prospective vs. retrospective classification</strong>

The IPC system is fundamentally geared towards <em>preventingÂ </em>famines, rather than assessing their severity after the event. As stated in the <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>,

<em>"The purpose of the IPC... is not to classify various degrees of famine, nor is it to categorize the â€œworst famineâ€. Rather, in order to inform real-time decision-making, the IPC thresholds for famine...Â are set to signify the beginning of famine stages."</em>

It is important to bear this in mind when trying to compare such assessments with famine trends over time. Our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">table of famine mortality since 1860</a>, on which the first chart in this post is based, provides estimates of the 'excess mortality' associated to individual famines.[ref] That is to say, the number of deaths in addition to that which would have been expected in the famine's absence. It should be borne in mind that many of the estimates in our table, particularly those from earlier periods, are not based on detailed demographic data but rather represent a certain degree of guesswork on the part of either contemporary observers or historians. For more discussion, see the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#data-quality-definition">Data Quality</a> section of our entry. [/ref] In reference to the discussion above, this can be thought of as a measure of magnitude only along one dimension, mortality.

Official famine declarations based on the IPC Area classification, like that made for South Sudan last year, do not straightforwardly map on to such an analysis. For instance, given the larger population being affected, it is quite possible that more people have died due to food consumption deficits since early 2017 in Yemen than in South Sudan, despite the intensity of the crisis not having met famine thresholds in any part of the country so far. We are not aware of any mortality estimates for the crisis in South Sudan or Yemen currently.[ref]However, late in 2017Â <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/yemen--hunger---disease-could-kill-at-least-50-000-children-this">Save the Children</a> predicted that child mortalities would go on to reach 50,000 by the end of that year. Accessed 31 Jan 2018.[/ref]

In terms of classification based on excess mortality alone, there are no officially-agreed criteria about which food emergencies should be counted as famines and which not. In collating our table of famine mortality weÂ excluded events with an estimated mortality of less than one thousand.[ref]Note that we have made use of a number of different sources and have thereby implicitly accepted the underlying definitions of famine held by observers and historians over time. It is likely that some events that today would be considered famines may not have been seen as such in the past and will therefore be missing from our table.Â [/ref] Currently our data do not include any mortality estimates for the ongoing crises in South Sudan, Yemen and elsewhere, but it now seems likely that in some cases, as mortality estimates emerge, their inclusion will be warranted.

Whether or not this will represent a reversal of the historical trend of decreasing famine mortality is as yet unknown and will largely depend upon how the conflicts driving the most acute food insecurity situations today will develop.";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"What does a famine declaration declare?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:38:"what-does-a-famine-declaration-declare";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-03-12 10:11:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-12 10:11:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=16016";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16069";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-19 10:32:45";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-19 10:32:45";s:12:"post_content";s:20077:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in articles dedicated to specific topics. In particular, this blog post is closely related to our article on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap/">determinants of the gender pay gap</a>, as well as to the article on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">determinants of female labor force participation</a>.

</br><em>This blog post benefitted greatly from research contributions provided by <strong>Sandra Tzvetkova.</strong></em>
</div>

Across the world women tend to take more family responsibilities than men. As a result women tend to be overrepresented in low paying jobs where they are more likely to have the flexibility required to attend to these additional responsibilities.

These two facts â€“Â <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap/">documented in the previous post on the gender pay gap</a>Â â€“ are often used to claim that, since men and women tend to be endowed with different tastes and talents, it follows that most of the observed gender differences in wages stem from biological sex differences. In this blog post I examine the evidence behind these claims.

In a nutshell, here's what I find:
<ul>
 	<li>There is evidence supporting the fact that, statistically speaking, men and women tend to differ in some key aspects, including psychological attributes that may affect labor-market outcomes.</li>
 	<li>There is no consensus on the exact weight that nurture and nature have in determining these differences, but whatever the exact weight, the evidence does show that these attributes are strongly malleable.</li>
 	<li>Regardless of the origin, these differences can only explain a modest part of the gender pay gap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some context regarding the gender distribution of labor</h3>
Before we get into the discussion of whether biological attributes explain wage differences via gender roles, let's get some perspective on the gender distribution of work.

The following chart shows, by country, the female-to-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work, including tasks like taking care of children at home, housework, or doing community work. As can be seen, all over the world there is a radical unbalance in the gender distribution of labor â€“ everywhere women take a disproportionate amount of unpaid work.

This is of course closely related to the fact that in most countries there are gender gaps in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation-rates-ILO-WDI">labor force participation</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo?country=CHE+URY+HTI+FRA+CRI+VNM+KOR+PAK+NOR">wages</a>.

<h3>"Boys are better at maths"</h3>
Differences in biological attributes that determine our ability to develop 'hard skills', such as maths, are often argued to be at the heart of the gender pay gap.[ref]Hard skills are abilities that can be defined and measured, such as writing, reading or doing maths. By contrast, soft skills are less tangible and harder to measure and quantify.[/ref] Do large gender differences in maths skills really exist? If so, is this because of differences in the attributes we are born with?

Let's look at the data.

Are boys better in the mathematics section of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/test/">PISA standardised test</a>? One could argue that looking at top scores is more relevant here, since top scores are more likely to determine gaps in future professional trajectories â€“ for example, gaps in access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'STEM degrees'</a> at the university level.

The chart below shows the share of male and female test-takers scoring at the highest level on the PISA test (that's level 6). As we can see, most countries lie above the diagonal line marking gender parity; so yes, achieving high scores in maths tends to be more common among boys than girls. However, there is huge cross-country variation â€“ the differences between countries are much larger than the difference between the sexes. And in many countries the gap is effectively inexistent.[ref]Also importantly: If we focus on gender differences for <em>average</em>, rather than top students, we find that there is not even a clear tendency in favor of boys. (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pisa-average-math-score-male-vs-female" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This interactive chart compares PISA average math scores for boys and girls</a>).[/ref]

Similarly, researchers have found that within countries there is also large geographic variation in gender gaps in test scores. So clearly these gaps in mathematic ability do not seem to be fully determined by biological endowments. [ref]For more on this see Pope, D. G., &amp; Sydnor, J. R. (2010). Geographic variation in the gender differences in test scores. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24(2), 95-108. Available online <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref]

Indeed, research looking at the PISA cross-country results suggests that improved social conditions for women are related to improved math performance by girls.[ref]Guiso, L., Monte, F., Sapienza, P., &amp; Zingales, L. (2008). Culture, gender, and math. SCIENCE-NEW YORK THEN WASHINGTON-, 320(5880), 1164.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pisa-share-top-math-male-vs-femal" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Not only statistical gaps in test scores vary substantially across societies â€“ they also vary substantially across time. This suggests that social factors play a large role in explaining  difference between the sexes.

In the US, for example, the gender gap in mathematics has narrowed in recent decades.[ref]A number of papers have documented the narrowing of gender gaps in test scores. See, for example, Hyde, J. S., Lindberg, S. M., Linn, M. C., Ellis, A. B., & Williams, C. C. (2008). Gender similarities characterize math performance. Science, 321(5888), 494-495. Available online <a href="http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/hyde.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] And this narrowing took place as high school curricula of boys and girls became more similar. The following chart shows this: In the US boys in 1957 took far more math and science courses than did girls; but by 1992 there was virtual parity in almost all science and math courses. 

More importantly for the question at hand, gender gaps in 'hard skills' are not large enough toÂ explain the gender gaps in earnings. In their review of the evidence, Blau and Kahn (2017)[ref]Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995">here</a>.[/ref] conclude that gaps in test scores in the US are too small to explain much of the gender pay at any point in time.

So, taken together, the evidence suggests that statistical gaps in maths test scores are both relatively small and heavily influenced by social and environmental factors.

<h3>"It's about personality"</h3>
Biological differences in <em>tastes</em> (e.g. preferences for 'people' over 'things'), <em>psychological attributes</em> (e.g. 'risk aversion') and <em>soft skills</em> (e.g. the ability to get along with others) are also often argued to be at the heart of the gender pay gap.

There are hundreds of studies trying to establish whether there are gender differences in preferences, personality traits and 'soft skills'. The quality and general relevance (i.e. the internal and external validity) of these studies is the subject of much discussion, as illustrated in the recent debate that ensued from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber">Google Memo affair</a>.

<a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/08/10/the-google-memo-what-does-the-research-say-about-gender-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent article from the 'Heterodox Academy</a>', which was produced specifically in the context of the Google Memo, provides a fantastic overview of the evidence on this topic and the key points of contention among scholars.

For the purpose of this blog post, let's focus on the review of the evidence presented in Blau and Kahn (2017) â€“ their review is particularly helpful because they focus on gender differences in the context of labor markets.

Blau and Kahn point out that, yes, researchers have found statistical differences between men and women that are important in the context of labor-market outcomes. For example, studies have found <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979391406700202?journalCode=ilra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistical gender differences in 'people skills'</a> (i.e. ability to listen, communicate, and relate to others). Similarly, experimental studies have found that <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women more often avoid salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show particular predisposition</a> to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotability. But are the origins of these differences mainly biological or are they social?Â And are they strong enough to explain pay gaps?

The available evidence here suggests these factors can only explain a relatively small fraction of the observed differences in wages.[ref]Blau and Kahn write: "While findings such as those in table 7 ['Selected Studies Assessing the Role of Psychological Traits in Accounting for the Gender Pay Gap'] are informative in elucidating some of the possible omitted factors that lie behind gender differences in wages as well as the unexplained gap in traditional wage regressions, in general, the results suggest that these factors do not account for a large portion of either the raw or unexplained gender gap."[/ref] And they are anyway far from being purely biological â€“ preferences and skills are highly malleable and 'gendering' begins early in life.[ref]For a discussion of 'gendering' see West, C., &amp; Zimmerman, D. H. (1987). Doing gender. Gender &amp; society, 1(2), 125-151.[/ref]

Here is a concrete example: Leibbrandt and List (2015)[ref]Leibbrandt, A., &amp; List, J. A. (2014). Do women avoid salary negotiations? Evidence from a large-scale natural field experiment. Management Science, 61(9), 2016-2024.[/ref] did an experiment in which they assessed how men and women reacted to job advertisements. They found that although men were more likely to negotiate than women when there was no explicit statement that wages were negotiable, the gender difference disappeared and even reversed when it was explicitly stated that wages were negotiable. This suggests that it is not as much about 'talent', as it is about norms and rules.
<h3>"A man should earn more than his wife"</h3>
The experiment in which researchers found that gender differences in negotiation attitudes disappeared when it was explicitly stated that wages were negotiable, emphasizes the important role that social norms and culture play in labor-market outcomes.

These concepts may seem abstract: What do social norms and culture actually look like in the context of the gender pay gap?

The reproduction of stereotypes through everyday positive enforcement can be seen in a range of aspects: A study analyzing 124 prime-time television programs in the US found that female characters continue to inhabit interpersonal roles with romance, family, and friends, while male characters enact work-related roles.[ref]Lauzen, M. M., Dozier, D. M., &amp; Horan, N. (2008). Constructing gender stereotypes through social roles in prime-time television. Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 52(2), 200-214.[/ref] In the realm of childrenâ€™s books, a study of 5,618 books found that compared to females, males are represented nearly twice as often in titles and 1.6 times as often as central characters.[ref]McCabe, J., Fairchild, E., Grauerholz, L., Pescosolido, B. A., &amp; Tope, D. (2011). Gender in twentieth-century childrenâ€™s books: Patterns of disparity in titles and central characters. Gender &amp; society, 25(2), 197-226.[/ref] Qualitative research shows that even in the home, parents are often enforcers of gender norms â€“ especially when it comes to fathers endorsing masculinity in male children.[ref]Kane, E. W. (2006). â€œNo way my boys are going to be like that!â€ Parentsâ€™ responses to childrenâ€™s gender nonconformity. Gender &amp; Society, 20(2), 149-176.[/ref]

Of particular relevance in the context of labor markets, social norms also often take the form of specific behavioral prescriptions such as "a man should earn more than his wife".

The following chart depicts the distribution of the share of the household income earned by the wife, across married couples in the US. Consistent with the idea that "a man should earn more than his wife", the data shows a sharp drop at 0.5, the point where the wife starts to earn more than the husband. This is the result of two factors. First, it is about the matching of men and women before they marry â€“ 'matches' in which the woman has higher earning potential are less common. And second, it is a result of choices after marriage â€“ the researchers show that married women with higher earning potential than their husband often stay out of the labor force, or take 'below-potential' jobs.[ref]More precisely, the authors find that in couples where the wifeâ€™s potential income is likely to exceed her husbandâ€™s (based on the income that would be predicted for her observed characteristics), the wife is less likely to be in the labor force, and if she does work, her income is lower than predicted.[/ref]

The authors of the study from which this chart is taken explored the data in more detail and found that in couples where the wife earns more than the husband, the wife spends more time on household chores, so the gender gap in unpaid care work is even larger; and these couples are also less satisfied with their marriage and are more likely to divorce than couples where the wife earns less than the husband.

The empirical exploration in this study highlights the remarkable power that gender norms and identity have on labor-market outcomes.

<h3>So what?</h3>
Does it actually matter if social norms and culture are important determinants of gender roles and labor-market outcomes? Are social norms in our contemporary societies really less fixed than biological traits?

Based on the available research, I believe the answer to these questions is yes, and yes. There is evidence that social norms can be actively and rapidly changed.

Here is a concrete example: Jensen and Oster (2009)[ref]Jensen, R., &amp; Oster, E. (2009). The power of TV: Cable television and women's status in India. InÂ <em>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>, 124(3), 1057-1094. Available <a href="http://demo.ncaer.org/popuppages/EventDetails/E10Jan2009/neemrana-paper12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>[/ref] find that the introduction of cable television in India led to a significant decrease in the reported acceptability of domestic violence towards women and son preference, as well as increases in womenâ€™s autonomy and decreases in fertility.

Of course, TV is a small aspect of all the big things that matter for social norms. But this study is important for the discussion because it is hard to study how social norms can be changed. TV introduction is a rare opportunity to see how a group that is exposed to a driver of social change actually changes.

As Jensen and Oster point out, most popular cable tv shows in India feature urban settings where lifestyles differ radically from those in rural areas. For example, many female characters on popular soap operas have more education, marry later and have smaller families than most women in rural areas. And, similarly, many female characters in these tv shows are featured working outside the home as professionals, running businesses or are shown in other positions of authority.

The bar chart below shows how cable access changed attitudes towards the self-reported preference for their child to be a son. As the authors note, <em>"reported desire for the next child to be a son is relatively unchanged in areas with no change in cable status, but it decreases sharply between 2001 and 2002 for villages that get cable in 2002, and between 2002 and 2003 (but notably not between 2001 and 2002) for those that get cable in 2003. For both measures of attitudes, the changes are large and striking, and correspond closely to the timing of introduction of cable."</em>

To conclude: The evidence suggests that biological differences are not a key driver of gender inequality in labor-market outcomes; while social norms and culture â€“ which in turn affect preferences, behavior and incentives to foster specific skills â€“ are very important.

This matters for policy because social norms are not fixed â€“ they can be influenced in a number of ways, including through intergenerational learning processes, exposure to alternative norms, and activism such as that which propelled the women's movement.[ref]Regarding intergenerational transmission of gender roles, see FernÃ¡ndez, R. (2013). Cultural change as learning: The evolution of female labor force participation over a century. The American Economic Review, 103(1), 472-500.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Extreme Poverty</a></strong>.</div>

According to the International Poverty Line, people are considered to be in 'extreme poverty' if they live on less than $1.90 per day, or the equivalent amount after converting currencies and adjusting for price differences between countries. This is the definition used by the World Bank and many other international institutions.

Clearly, $1.90 is a <em>very</em> low threshold, so extreme poverty is, well, extreme.

It is very important that fewer people live in such extreme misery, and thankfully that has happened. Today, about 10% of the world population lives in extreme poverty, while in 1990 the corresponding figure was about 37%. Two centuries ago <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-home-production-and-consumption">almost everyone in the world lived in extreme poverty</a>.

But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't care about what is happening relative to higher poverty lines. The evidence shows that there is a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#what-do-poor-people-think-about-poverty">clear and continuous relationship between material deprivation and subjective well-being</a>, so it would be wrong to celebrate shifting daily incomes from $1.89 to $1.91, even if this shift technically means abruptly reducing extreme poverty. People living on $3, $5, or $10 per day also face substantial hardships, and are still living in poverty.

So, how has poverty changed relative to these higher thresholds?

The short answer is that global poverty rates have also been falling above the $1.90 line. This means that, although much still needs to be done, progress has been real. The historical reductions in global extreme poverty are not merely the result of people moving marginally above some arbitrary misery threshold.

Let's take a closer look at the evidence.
<h3>Data: source and limitations</h3>
<a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povDuplicateWB.aspx">PovcalNet</a> is a database of consumption and income distributions from all over the world. It is produced and maintained by the World Bank, and it is the most important source of cross-country data to measure poverty.

The main purpose of PovcalNet is to measure global poverty, and accordingly, there are some limitations that follow from the way they produce their data. Importantly: (i) for all countries the top tails of the distributions are unreliable; and (ii) estimates of extreme poverty in rich countries, where PovcalNet uses data from income rather than consumption surveys, are not accurate nor comparable to those in poorer countries.[ref] In the documentation, the source writes: "PovcalNet was developed for the sole purpose of public replication of the World Bankâ€™s poverty measures for its widely used international poverty lines, including $1.90 a day and $3.20 a day in 2011 PPP. The methods built into PovcalNet are considered reliable for that purpose. However, we cannot be confident that the methods work well for other purposes, including tracing out the entire distribution of income. We would especially warn that estimates of the densities near the bottom and top tails of the distribution could be quite unreliable, and no attempt has been made by the Bankâ€™s staff to validate the tool for such purposes."[/ref]

Because of these limitations, <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/chart-week-4-angus-deaton-location-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we can't really use PovcalNet to study extreme poverty in rich countries</a>, just as we can't use it to study the incomes of very rich people in any given country.

But we can use it to explore how incomes below, say, 10 dollars per day are changing for most people in the world.
<h3>Global poverty</h3>
The visualisation below uses PovcalNet data to show the distribution of the world population across different poverty thresholds. This shows a fantastic achievement: Independently of which of the shown thresholds you think should be the appropriate poverty line, the result is the same. The global poverty rate has been falling across all these poverty lines. Indeed,Â <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/no-matter-what-global-poverty-line">the share of people below any poverty line has declined globally</a> in recent years.

As we can see, more progress has been achieved for the three lowest lines. And this takes us to another important observation: Today, almost two-thirds of the world population live below 10 dollars per day. This explains why, if we want to focus on those who are worst off, we need to use fairly low poverty lines, such as the $1.90 and $3.10 lines employed by the World Bank.[ref]In some reports (e.g. this from the <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/07/08/a-global-middle-class-is-more-promise-than-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pew Research Center</a>), the segment between $3.10 and $10 is referred to as 'low income' rather than 'poverty'. In fact, as our chart shows, if you rank the world population by income today, and split them into three groups of equal size, you will find that the middle group is defined by the bracket $3.10-$10. So people in this bracket could also be considered 'middle income'. [/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-per-capita-household-consumption?stackMode=relative" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

The next visualization shows the number, rather than the share, of people between the different poverty thresholds. (You can always switch between this and the previous chart by clicking on the visualization and toggling the button labelled 'relative'.)

Again, this is an encouraging picture. For more than a decade, the <em> number </em> of people living under the three lowest poverty lines has been on the decline. So, independently of which of these poverty lines you choose, not only have poverty rates declined, but the total number of people living in poverty has also fallen.

Obviously, there is still much work to be done. Even 10 dollars per day provides a very low standard of living. But the key message here is that the incomes of those at the bottom are increasing.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-per-capita-household-income" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Understanding progress and challenges, country by country</h3>
The charts above give us an idea of how global poverty is changing. Yet the fortunes of people around the world have changed very differently depending on where they live.

Here, again, we can use PovcalNet's data to explore the evolution of poverty for particular countries and regions. Below we discuss some countries we found interesting, but you can do your own analysis by clicking on any visualization and selecting the option 'change country' at the bottom of the chart.

<strong>China</strong>

The case of China is remarkable. As the chart below shows, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of people living in extreme poverty, while at the same time there has been an increase in the number of people living on incomes above $10 a day.

If you switch to the 'relative' view, you see that poverty rates have been going down for all of the included poverty lines. In 1981, the entire Chinese population lived below $3.10. Today less than 12% of the population live below this threshold.

If you compare China and India, for example, you can see that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-per-capita-household-consumption?stackMode=relative&amp;country=IND">while Indians have also made substantial progress, they have seen a slower reduction in poverty, especially at higher thresholds</a>.Â The case of China is special, but it would be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/the-global-decline-of-extreme-poverty-was-it-only-china">wrong to assume that extreme poverty in the world fell 'only' because of China</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-per-capita-household-consumption?country=CHN" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>

Relative to the global average, Sub-Saharan Africa has made much slower progress in reducing poverty. And this is, unfortunately, especially true at higher poverty thresholds.

As the chart below shows, the total number of people living in extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa has been fairly constant in recent years, and it remains higher than it was in 1981. Above extreme poverty, if we look at the $3.10 line, we see that the increase in the number of poor people is even more pronounced.

However, in relative terms, poverty trends in Sub-Saharan Africa are slightly more encouraging: The share of people living below $3.10 has been falling.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-per-capita-household-consumption?country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
Measuring poverty is difficult because it requires making a sharp distinction between those who are and aren't considered poor. So when we see that global extreme poverty is going down, it is natural to ask ourselves: Are these reductions produced by a definition of â€˜extremeâ€™ poverty which is too low?

The evidence discussed above shows that this is not the case. The global poverty rate has been going down in recent years, and this is true independently of whether we set the poverty line at 1.90 or 10 dollars per day.

Of course, high levels of deprivation are unfortunately still very common in most countries, and in many parts of the world we are not making progress.

<h4>Education in Ethiopia: tangible progress and persistent challenges</h4>
Over the past two decades, the Ethiopian government has shown a strong commitment to education sector development, making significant strides in terms of access to education and opportunities to learn. This endeavour has received global attention. In 2008, Ethiopia was identified in the <em>Education for All (EFA) Global Monitoring </em><em>Report</em>[ref]UNESCO (2007) â€“ Education for all by 2015: Will we make it? Global Monitoring Report 2008, Paris: UNESCO Publishing.[/ref] as one of the countries that has seen the most rapid progress towards the <em>Framework for Action</em> goals agreed in Dakar in 2000, notably universal enrollment and gender parity at the primary level.

But challenges remain. Student transition to higher grades remains limited, particularly among children from the most disadvantaged groups. Late enrolment often figures alongside intermittent progress through grades and has become a barrier for meeting age-appropriate targets (with individuals becoming classified as â€˜over-ageâ€™ for grade) for primary completion and progression to secondary grades. This is compounded by poor system performance and, consequently, to poor learning outcomes, so doing little to encourage students through the school gate.[ref]Woldehanna, T. and M. Araya (2016) â€“Â <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/educational-inequalities-among-children-and-young-people-ethiopia">Education inequalities among children and young people in Ethiopia. Young Lives Country Report</a>.[/ref]
<h4><a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/">Young Lives</a>: a precious resource tracking changes across the life course</h4>
The <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/">Young Lives</a> study has been core-funded by the UKâ€™s <em>Department for International Development</em> and aims to provide policy-relevant findings over the life course of children living in poverty, in line with the global sustainable development agenda. Since 2002, Young Lives has followed the lives of 12,000 children in two age cohorts (4,000 'Older Cohort' children born in 1994/95 and 8,000 'Younger Cohort' children born in 2001/02) from different social, religious, ethnic and language groups across rural and urban sites in four countries, including Ethiopia.

In Ethiopia, the Young Lives children have grown up in the wake of national education reform. In 1994, the government introduced its first education policy that set out the subsequent expansion of formal schooling in the country, coinciding with the birth year of the Older Cohort. While Young Lives is not intended to be nationally representative, with <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/our-research-methods">over-sampling</a> of poorer children, the sample is still able to capture Ethiopiaâ€™s diversity across regions and within a range of children.

Through its unique multi-cohort design, Young Lives data permit exploration of the determining factors of educational progress (individually and nationally) and cognitive development over a crucial period in the history of the Ethiopian education system. Furthermore, the five rounds of data collection span the children's education cycle from the age of primary-school enrolment to an age when they typically make their transition into tertiary education (or they have already dropped out of school) and enter the labour market, so offering a rich insight into the drivers, motivators and influences on educational trajectories over a 15-year period.

In this blog we document and discuss six stories and challenges for education in Ethiopia as told through Young Lives data. Please note that while the visuals below are static, they can be <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/young-lives-data-visualizations-guide">clicked on</a>, taking you to the dynamic data visualizations on the Young Lives website. There, you can also explore more of our findings and data (which is publicly available through the <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/use-our-data">UK data archive</a>).

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Challenge 1. </strong>Lack of access to pre-schooling</h4>
The potential of quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) to transform young lives is now widely recognized in research, policy and service delivery. With a global focus, the United Nation Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 4.2 states that, by 2030, countries should:
<blockquote><em>Ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.</em></blockquote>
The Young Lives data captures the state of pre-school enrolment in Ethiopia study sites in 2006, when the pre-school system was still emergent.[ref]Pre-school in Ethiopia is typically between ages of 4 and 6.[/ref] Only 25 per cent of Young Lives children (overwhelmingly from urban-based households) were enrolled in pre-school, predominantly in private kindergartens. Only 4 per cent and 8 per cent of children from the bottom and middle wealth index tercile attended pre-school.[ref]The wealth index is a composite index measuring households' access to services such as water and sanitation, their ownership of consumer durables such as refrigerators, and the quality of floor, roof, and wall materials in their dwelling. Households in each cohort of the Young Lives survey were categorised into terciles based on their wealth index in each survey round, with the households with lowest wealth belonging to the bottom tercile, and those with the highest wealth belonging to the top tercile.[/ref]Â [ref]Favara, Marta, Martin Woodhead, Juan Francisco Castro, Grace Chang, Patricia Espinoza (2017) â€˜Pre-school Education and Skills Development in Peru, Vietnam, Ethiopia and India:Â  Evidence from Young Livesâ€™, in forthcoming World Bank publication, 2017. (see <a href="http://www.younglives.org.uk/node/8446">http://www.younglives.org.uk/node/8446</a>)[/ref]

Tracking these children has shown that those who attended pre-school have better numeracy skills than non-attenders at both the age of 5 and 8 and the gap tends to increase as children grow older. Differences between pre-school attenders and non-attenders (for example in terms of socio-economic background, and investments in human capital) play a significant role in explaining the gap in numeracy test scores. Nevertheless, the existence of this gap is not wholly explained by these factors so further exploration of the positive role of pre-school for skills development is warranted.
<h4>Challenge 2: Increased primary education enrolment but late enrolment persists</h4>
Formal education in Ethiopia begins at age seven. However, late enrolment is pervasive. The graph below shows the average enrolment rate in formal education for the Younger and Older Cohort children, at different ages.

In both cohorts, more girls than boys are enrolled at all ages. This gender gap in enrolment is represented in the chart with circles (i.e. the bigger the circle, the more girls than boys are enrolled in formal education).

Less than half of Older Cohort children start schooling at the age of seven. This rate increased by 14 per cent for Younger Cohort children at the same age, seven years later. However, only 57 per cent of these were enrolling â€˜on timeâ€™ in terms of formal age for grade. An upward trend in the enrolment rate after the age of seven in both cohorts suggests that children are starting school late. Wealth, social capital, level of maternal education and ownership of land are among the factors that were found to have a positive impact on whether Older Cohort children were enrolled in school by the age of 7/8.[ref]Woldehanna, T. A. Mekonnen, N. Jones, B. Tefera, J. Seager, T. Alemu, G. Asgedom (2005) Education choices in Ethiopia: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=9&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk3Yibo9LYAhXExxQKHZOPDC4QFghSMAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fyounglives.qeh.ox.ac.uk%2Fpublications%2FPP%2Feducation-choices-Ethiopia%2Feducational-choices-in-ethiopia-what-determines-whether-poor-children-go-to-school&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Uj7X5X3hm3oAP09OnmTIs">What determines whether poor households send their children to school?</a> Young Lives Working Paper 15.[/ref]<a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"></a>

<h4>Challenge 3: Absenteeism, early drop-out, and conflicting responsibilities</h4>
The chart above shows that enrolment peaks at the age of 12/13 at 93 per cent for both cohorts, and starts declining at the age of 14/15 when children are <em>expected</em> to be in their last year of primary school (however, this is not always, as we will show below, with some individuals in the right grade for their age). This is also the age when the pro-girl gender gap starts widening and, by the age of 18, 9 per cent more girls are enrolled than boys.

Indeed, girls are more likely to progress in their education and complete secondary education than boys. The main reason for this lies in the division of labour, which in Ethiopia is markedly gendered: girls primarily carry out domestic work within the household and boys tend to predominantly work outside the household, mainly in herding or farming activities.[ref]Morrow, V., Boyden, J. (forthcoming 2018) <em>Responding to childrenâ€™s work: Evidence from the Young Lives study in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam, </em>Summative Report, Oxford: Young Lives[/ref] Staying in education can, therefore, be a more expensive choice for boys than for girls who can generally arrange their school and in-household responsibilities more flexibly than boys.[ref]Tafere, Y. and N. Chuta (2016) <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/gendered-trajectories-young-people-through-school-work-and-marriage-ethiopia">Gendered trajectories of young people through school, work and marriage in Ethiopia</a>. Young Lives Working Paper 155.[/ref] [ref]Favara, M. (2017) <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jae/article/26/5/561/4096500">Do dreams come true? Aspirations and educational attainments of Ethiopian boys and girls</a>, Journal of African Economies, 26(5):561-583.[/ref] Absenteeism is a precursor to drop-out, often linked to poor progress and performance. The most common reason given for boy absenteeism and drop-out is their involvement in paid or unpaid domestic/agricultural work, whereas for girls this is most commonly attributed to the need to care for younger siblings.[ref]Frost, M. and C. Rolleston (2013) <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/improving-education-quality-equity-and-access">Improving Education Quality, Equity and Access: A Report on Findings from the Young Lives School Survey (Round 1) in Ethiopia</a>, Young Lives Working paper 96, 2013[/ref]
<h4>Challenge 4. Slow grade progression and increasing disparities</h4>
The chart below visualizes the percentage of Younger and Older Cohort students who are over-age for grade (older than the official entrance age for each grade). Late enrolment combined with slow progression through grades results in delayed education trajectories for those children who remain within the education system.

At the age of 15, when students should leave primary education and transition to secondary education in Ethiopia, only 27 per cent of Older Cohort children progressed as expected. On average, of this group at age 19, when it would be expected that they enter university education (following over 12 years of schooling), most have only completed 8â€“9 years of education. This is not surprising given the prevalence of over-age enrolment in primary education.

However, this is not the only factor explaining the high prevalence of over-age Ethiopian students. The bulk of delayed students increases year on year, signalling a cumulative delay, i.e. a slow progression through grades. Many factors can be posited, including grade repetition as linked to poor performance or absenteeism, re-entrance after a period of non-enrolment, and other circumstances. This pattern of increasing incidence of over-age students is similar for both males and females with more males being over-age for grade compared to females. Again, this could reflect competing responsibilities out of school.
<h6><a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/percentage-children-over-age-for-grade-all-country-sites#overlay-context=">Over-age for grade in Ethiopia sites</a></h6>
<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Over-age.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16419" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Over-age-666x550.png" alt="" width="666" height="550" /></a>

The good news is that the prevalence of over-age students decreased in the 7-year period between the Older and Younger Cohort children. Nevertheless, the percentage of enrolled children who are over-age from the bottom wealth tercile has remained the same, as shown in the graph <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/young.lives.oxford#!/vizhome/e2_overage/Overage">here</a>.[ref]Children from the middle tercile households have experienced the biggest decrease in over-age enrollment from 76% over-aged 14-year-olds in the Older Cohort to 55% over-aged 14-year-olds in the Younger Cohort.[/ref]
<h4>Challenge 5: Unmet educational aspirations</h4>
Young Lives children have high hopes for their education, as the chart below shows. At the age of 12, 73 per cent of children aspire to complete university. However, children living in the poorest families have substantially lower educational aspirations than children from the less poor households. So too, aspirations decrease as children grow up. Between the ages of 12 and 19, childrenâ€™s aspirations change significantly and they tend to adjust their aspirations downward in line with their lived reality and their perception of the opportunities available to them.[ref]Favara, M. (2017) <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jae/article/26/5/561/4096500">Do dreams come true? Aspirations and educational attainments of Ethiopian boys and girls</a>, Journal of African Economies, 26(5):561-583.[/ref] There is a marked inflection point at the age of 15, the same age at which the drop-out rate increases. Notably, after the age of 15, the gender gap in aspiration shifts in favour of girls, mirroring the higher drop-out rate among boys after the age of 15.

<h4>Challenge 6. Scarce improvement in learning levels</h4>
Learning levels have not increased in tandem with enrolment. Comparing Older Cohort with Younger Cohort 15-year-olds reveals that there has been no overall improvement in learning levels.[ref]Young Lives (2017) <a href="https://www.younglives.org.uk/content/education-and-learning-preliminary-findings-round-5-survey-ethiopia">Education and learning: Preliminary findings from the 2016 Young Lives Survey (Round 5): Ethiopia.</a>[/ref]

Considerable disparities between socio-economic groups emerge when comparing children from bottom wealth tercile households with their peers, in favour of the latter. The poor quality of many school play a major role.

&nbsp;

<strong>On the right track, but momentum must continue</strong>

While grade progression remains slow, learning poor, and aspirations frequently unmet, there has also been noticeable intergenerational progress between Young Lives children and their parents, at least in children attaining higher school grades. The chart below compares the percentage of Young Lives parents and children who achieved post-secondary education across a number of sub-groups defined by gender, socio-economic status, location and region of residency. On average, 25 per cent of 22-year-olds are currently enrolled or have finished post-secondary education compared to 6 per cent of their parents.[ref]Young Lives (2018) Poverty and intergenerational change: Preliminary findings from the 2016 Young Lives Survey (Round 5): Ethiopia.[/ref] Once again, the greatest improvements are documented among individuals from better-off households and those in urban sites.

Every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death (second only toÂ cardiovascular diseases).[ref]Schutte, A. E. (2017). Global, regional, and national age-sex specific mortality for 264 causes of death, 1980-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. Available <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32152-9.pdf">online</a>.[/ref] In 2016, 8.9 million people are estimated to have died from the various forms of cancer. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) put relatively small error margins around this global figure: the lower and upper estimates extend from 8.75 to 9.1 million.[ref]Full data on cancer deaths, including upper and lower estimates can be downloaded at the IHME's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool">Results Tool</a>.[/ref] Progress against many other causes of deaths and demographic drivers of increasing <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#shares-by-world-regions">population size</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a> andÂ â€” particularly in higher-income countriesÂ â€” aging populations mean that the total number of cancer deaths continues to increase. This is a very personal topic to many: nearly everyone knows or has lost someone dear to them from this collection of diseases.

In advance of <a href="http://www.worldcancerday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Cancer Day</a>Â (on February 4th), in this short blog post we present a global overview of cancer deathsÂ â€” how these vary by cancer type, age, and how the incidence of cancer deaths is evolving. Whilst we largely focus on the global pattern of cancer deaths, all of the data presented here â€“ based on estimates from the IHME's <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">Global Burden of Disease</a>Â programme â€“ is available to explore by country using the "change country" function at the bottom of the interactive charts which follow.
<h3>Number of cancer deaths by type</h3>
Cancers are defined by the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Cancer Institute (NCI)</a> as a collection of diseases in which abnormal cells can divide and spread to nearby tissue. As this definition suggests, cancers can arise in many parts of the body (leading to a range of cancer types, as shown below) and in some cases spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.

In the chart below we see the total number of deaths in 2016 attributed to the range of cancer types. With more than double the number of attributed deaths of the next leading form, 'tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer' claimed the largest number of lives at more than 1.7 million in one year. Next follow 'stomach cancer', 'colon and rectum cancer', and 'liver cancer', all with a similar number of deaths, at around 830,000 globally in 2016.

This chart also allows exploring deaths by country (click 'change country' at the bottom of the chart).

In exploring patterns across various countries, we see that 'tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer' is the leading form of cancer deaths across most high and middle-income countries. However, the leading form in lower income countries varies: colon and rectum; liver; cervical; stomach; breast and prostrate all top the list in several countries.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/total-cancer-deaths-by-type" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

If we look at how the number of cancer deaths has changed since 1990Â â€” as in the chart belowÂ â€” we see that global deaths have increased from around 5.7 million to 8.9 million over this period. Note you can scroll over this chart to see the annual number of deaths by type over time. For clarity, we have grouped all cancer types with less than 100,000 global deaths in 2016 into a collective category 'Other cancers'.

If we switch the chart below to "relative" mode we can compare how the distribution and share of deaths across the various cancer types has changed since 1990. With just under 20 percent of the total, 'tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer' have the highest share at the global level. Overall, we see that the relative share of deaths across cancer types has remained largely stable with time. Some notable changes occurred in stomach cancer (which has fallen from 13.8 to 9.4 percent); esophageal cancer (falling from 5.7 to 4.7 percent); liver cancer (rising from 8.2 to 9.3 percent); and pancreatic cancer (rising from 3.6 to 4.6 percent). <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-deaths-by-type-grouped" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Cancer deaths by age</h3>
How are cancer deaths distributed across age groups?

In the chart below we see the breakdown of total cancer deaths by broad age category, ranging from under-5s to those over 70 years old. Overall, we see that the majority of cancer deaths occur in those over 50 years old; 44 percent of cancer deaths in people aged 70+ years old, closely followed by 43 percent aged between 50 and 69. The distribution of deaths across the age spectrum has changed notably since 1990; the share of deaths which occur in those aged over 70 has increased by 7 percent, whilst the share in those aged 50-69 and 15-49 has fallen by approximately 3-4 percent each.

Collectively, children and adolescents under 14 years old account for less than one percent of cancer deathsÂ â€” although still tragically, this equates to around 80,000 children per year.Â Â <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-deaths-by-age" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Are death rates from cancer rising?</h3>
With an increase in global cancer deaths from 5.7 to 8.9 million since 1990 (an increase of 56 percent), and similar trends in the number of absolute deaths across most countries, it may seem reasonable to assume that cancer death rates are on the rise. But is this really the case?

Whilst a crucial metric of total disease burden and mortality, the absolute number of deaths has two key caveats: it fails to account for changes in population size and age structure. As we have explored above, the majority of cancer deaths occur in those aged over 50 years old; this means we should expect the total number of cancer deaths to increase as a population ages. The drivers of rising <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a>, aging populations, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#shares-by-world-regions">population growth</a> can compound to give a skewed perception of frequency.

A more useful metric in this regard is the age-standardized death rate. This metric corrects for the effects of changing age distributions by normalising to a fixed reference population structure (assumed the same across countries and with time), and for differences in population size by reporting as the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals.[ref]The IHME Global Burden of Disease (GBD) <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/terms-defined">define age-standardization</a> as: "A statistical technique used to compare populations with different age structures, in which the characteristics of the populations are statistically transformed to match those of a reference population. Useful because relative over- or under-representation of different age groups can obscure comparisons of age-dependent diseases (e.g., ischemic heart disease or malaria) across populations."[/ref] The age-standardized death rate from all cancer types are shown in the visualisation below. This data can be explored through time using the 'play' button at the bottom of the chart, and national time-series can be viewed by clicking on a respective country.

In 2016, we see that most countries have death rates of 50 to 150 deaths per 100,000 individuals. On average, higher-income countries tend to fall towards the upper band of this range; across North America, Europe, and Australasia, rates are typically close to 150 per 100,000. This is also true across a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rates across Latin America, Asia, and some parts of Africa are on average lower (50-125 per 100,000).

If we use the timeline to see how death rates have changed since 1990 we see that rates have fallen significantly across a large share of countries. In the United States and Canada, rates have fallen from over 180 in 1990 to below 150 per 100,000; in the 1990s, Russia peaked at over 200 per 100,000 and has since fallen below 150; and China has seen a similar size of decline since 1990. This is not true everywhere: rates have risen across some countries, including South Africa and India. Age-specific death rates, in comparison to all age and age-standardized rates can be explored <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-age">here</a>.

The overall global trend nonetheless shows an often counter-intuitive finding: despite increasing numbers of cancer deaths, individual death rates are falling. In 1990, 161 people out of every 100,000 globally died from cancerÂ â€” by 2016 this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL">had fallen</a> to 134 per 100,000.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

For the purposes of assessing the total incidence of cancer, in the chart above we grouped all cancer types together to look at overall trends. However, death rates and progress in reducing mortality incidence varies across the many forms of cancer. In the chart below we see the individual age-standardized death rates across cancer types. This is again measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals.

As we would expect from the leading cause of cancer deaths, rates in tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer are highest globally at 26 per 100,000. This has fallen slightly from approximately 29 per 100,000 in 1990, with even greater declines in some countries (in the US, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-type?country=USA">rates have fallen</a> from 53 to 41 per 100,000).

In some cases we have seen dramatic declines over the last few decades. The most notable is stomach cancer, for which death rates have fallen by more than 40 percent from 22 to 13 per 100,000. Rates in esophageal and cervical cancer have also both dropped by around one-third since 1990.Â <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-type" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Understanding the global cancer disease burden</h3>
The overall global trends on cancer mortality â€” as summarised in data aboveÂ â€” tells a story which at first glance can seem conflicting.

The total number of deaths from cancer is increasing. This is predominantly a result of aging (and growing) populations. Once we correct the number of deaths for population size, we see that cancer death rates have approximately flatlined; then when further corrected for age we see that globally, death rates are falling. This represents progress, although very slow.

Although not the focus of this blog post (which has focused on cancer <em>deaths</em>), survival rates introduce another metric of progress. Here, we have seen significant developments in recent decades. In the United States, for example, the five-year survival rate across a range of cancer types has <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOidpiTW4AAqlr-.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased significantly</a> over the past 20-30 years. Cancer continues to claim the lives of many, but we are perhaps slowly moving in the right direction.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.</div>
This post is the first of a pair of posts looking the relationship between famines and population growth. Here we consider whether population growth causes famine and hunger. In a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/do-famines-check-population-growth">second post</a>, we look at the demographic impacts of famines, and in particular the extent to which famines may 'check' population growth.
<h3>Modern Malthusians</h3>
<em>Itâ€™s no good blaming climate change or food shortages or political corruption. Sorry to be neo-Malthusian about it, but <strong>continuing population growth in this region makes periodic famine unavoidable</strong> â€“ as many people have been pointing out since the last famine. Many of the children saved by the money raised over the next few weeks will inevitably be back again in similar feedingÂ centresÂ with their ownÂ children in a few years time.</em>
<p style="text-align: right;">- Blog entry from British environmentalist, Sir Jonathan Porrit, 11/07/2011[ref]<a href="http://www.jonathonporritt.com/blog/who-would-have-thought-it-population-growth-and-famine-would-appear-be-linked">Who would have thought it? Population growth and famine would appear to be linked!</a> Blog entry from www.jonathanporritt.com, datedÂ 11/07/2011. Accessed 19 Jan 2018. Emphasis added.[/ref]</p>
It is not uncommon to see arguments along the lines of this quote fromÂ Sir Jonathan Porritt, claiming that famines are ultimately caused by overpopulation.Â Porritt â€“ former director of 'Friends of the Earth' and also former chairman of the UK Governmentâ€™s Sustainable Development CommissionÂ â€“ was talking about the 2011 famineÂ in Somalia that went on to kill roughly 250,000 people[ref]The excess mortality estimate is taken from the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/">World Peace Foundation</a> list of famines.[/ref]. He seems certain that the rapid population growth witnessed in East Africa had made famine there â€˜unavoidableâ€™.

There is something compelling about this logic: a finite land area, with a limited â€˜carrying capacityâ€™, cannot continue to feed a growing population indefinitely.Â From such a perspective, the provision of humanitarian aid to famine-afflicted countries, however well intended, represents only a temporary fix. In this view it fails to address the fundamental issue: there simply being too many mouths to feed.

As mentioned in the quote, this suggestion is commonly associated with the name of Thomas Robert Malthus, the English political economist writing at the turn of the nineteenth century. Malthus is famous for the assertion that in the absence of â€˜preventative checksâ€™ to reduce <em>birth</em> rates, the natural tendency for populations to increase â€“ being â€˜so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for manâ€™ â€“ ultimately results in â€˜positive checksâ€™ that increase the <em>death</em> rate. If all else fails to curb population, <em>â€˜gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world'</em>.[ref] Malthus T.R. 1798.Â <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. Chapter VII, p 44.[/ref]

But does the evidence support this idea? Here we look into the relationship between population growth and famine, as well as that between population growth and hunger more generally.
<h3>Does population growth cause famine?</h3>
For our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a> we produced a dataset of the estimated number of deaths from all famines worldwide since the 1860s. The chart below compares the number of deaths per decade with the total world population over the same period.

Looking at the world as whole, it is very difficult to square Malthus' hypothesis with the simple but stark fact that, despite the world population increasing from less than one billion in 1800 to more than seven billion today, the number of people dying due to famine in recent decades is only a tiny fraction of that in previous eras.
<h6>Famine victims by decade and world population, 1860s-2010s</h6>
<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Famine-victims-and-world-population-since-1860.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17425" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Famine-victims-and-world-population-since-1860-750x512.png" alt="" width="750" height="512" /></a>
We might naturally think that the explanation for this trend lies in increasing agricultural production. Indeed,Â <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person">food supply per person</a>Â has consistently increased in recent decades, the large increase in global population being met with an even greater increase in food supply (largely due to increases in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture">yields per hectare</a>).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-supply-by-region-in-kilocalories-per-person-per-day-1961-2013" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

However, looking at the issue in this way is too simple. As we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>, insufficient aggregate food supply per person is just one factor that can bring about famine mortality. Contemporary famine scholarship tends to suggest that insufficient aggregate food supply is less important than one might think, and instead emphasises the role of public policy and violence: in most famines of the 20th and 21st centuries, conflict, political oppression, corruption, or gross economic mismanagement on the part of dictatorships or colonial regimes played a key role.[ref]See, for instance, de Waal, A. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629817302871#!">The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action</a>, <em>Political Geography</em>, 62:2008[/ref] The same also applies for the most acutely food-insecure countries today.[ref]The threat of famine in Yemen, South Sudan and Nigeria are all the direct consequence of conflict, and the drought in Somalia arrives after decades of conflict and political instability. See <a href="http://www.fews.net/">FEWS.net</a> for more details.[/ref] It is also true of the 2011 famine in Somalia referred to above, in which food aid was greatly restricted, and in some cases diverted, by militant Islamist group al ShabaabÂ and other armed opposition groups in the country.[ref]Â Seal, A., &amp; Bailey, R. (2013). The 2011 Famine in Somalia: lessons learnt from a failed response? <i>Conflict and Health</i>, <i>7</i>, 22. http://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1505-7-22. As the authors note, this was in part due to concern on the part of humanitarian organisations that they would be contravening US government sanctions. Furthermore, both the US and the EU had significantly reduced humanitarian spending in the country in the run up to the famine.[/ref]

Famine scholar Stephen Devereux of the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, summarizes the trajectory of famines over the 20th century as follows:Â <em>"The achievement of a global capacity to guarantee food security was accompanied by a simultaneous expansion of the capacity of governments to inflict lethal policies, including genocidal policies often involving the extraction of food from the poor and denial of food to the starving."</em>[ref]Devereux, S.<a href="https://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf"><em> Famine in the Twentieth Century. </em></a>IDS working paper 105, 2000.[/ref]

Thus, all in all, the recent history of famine mortality does not fit the Malthusian narrative particularly well. Firstly, contrary to what Malthus predicted for rapidly increasing populations, food supply per person hasÂ â€“ in all regions â€“ increased as populations have grown. Secondly, famines have not become more, but less frequent. Thirdly, in the modern era the occurrence of major famine mortality, and its prevention, is something for which politics and policy seem the more salient triggers.
<h3>Does population growth increase hunger?</h3>
Famines tend to be thought of as acute periods of crisis, and are in that sense to be distinguished from more chronic manifestations of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">hunger</a> that may in some places represent 'normal' circumstances, despite being responsible for large numbers of deaths.[ref]de Waal, 2018 defines famine as '<em>a crisis of mass hunger that causes elevated mortality over a specific period of time'</em>. Note that the official <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/">IPC classification system</a> used by the UN for famine declarations just looks at total (undernourishment-related) death rates in absolute terms, rather than relative to any non-crisis reference level. This contrasts somewhat to the typical ex-ante famine assessment in which <em>excess</em> mortality is estimated by factoring out the counterfactual death rateÂ â€“ however high.[/ref] Given the typically political nature of outbreaks of such famine crises, it may make more sense to look for an effect of population growth on the longer-term trends of hunger and malnutrition.

But again, at the global level, we know that population growth has been accompanied by a downward trend in hunger. As we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">Hunger and Undernourishment</a>, in recent decades the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-undernourishment?tab=chart">proportion of undernourished people in the world has fallen</a>, and, although more muted, this fall is also seen in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-population-defined-as-undernourished">absolute number</a>. The number of people dying globally due to insufficient calorie or protein intake has also fallen, from almost half a million in the 1990s to roughly 300,000 in the most recent data,Â as shown in the visualisation below.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malnutrition-deaths-by-age" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;

We can also look at the experiences of individual countries, rather than just at the global level. Do those countries with particularly high population growth rates find it harder to adequately feed its population?

In order to get some ideaÂ about this, we can compare countries'Â <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#the-global-hunger-index-ghi">Global Hunger Index</a>Â (GHI) score with their population growth rates. GHI is a composite measure, out of 100, that combines four indicators: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">undernourishment</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#too-little-weight-for-height-wasting">child wasting</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-of-children">child stunting</a>, and <a href="https://owid.cloud/child-mortality/">child mortality</a>.[ref]More information on these individual indicators, including their definitions, can be found on our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">Hunger and Undernourishment</a>.[/ref] The first scoring was conducted in 1992, and was then repeated every eight years with the most recent being in carried out in 2017. The score is based on data collected in the years leading up to the scoring year, and as such reflect the hunger levels in this period rather than solely capturing conditions in the year itself. The graphs below show all the countries for which there was GHI data available between 1992 and 2017.[ref]Population data was taken from the World Bank for 1992 to 2016. Note that GHI is typically not collected for wealthy countries. Below a score of 5, GHI gets bottom coded as '&lt;5'. Of the 95 countries for which we have data in both years, none of them began bottom coded but five moved into this range by 2017. In the analysis that follows we replaced these bottom-coded observations with a GHI of 2.5. However the key results are robust to omitting these countries altogether. As a robustness check, we also conducted the analysis on the prevalence of undernourishment separately (one of the four components of GHI). The key results remained unchanged.[/ref] Crucially, <em>this excludes a number of very food-insecure countries</em>Â including the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan andÂ Somalia, which have also seen high levels of population growth.[ref]These three countries would be situated in the top quarter of our sample in terms of population growth, with DRC and South Sudan roughly in the top decile.[/ref] This should be borne in mind when interpreting the following results.

Of the countries for which we do have GHI data, it is clear that those with higher levels of hunger have also tended to have had higher population growth over the last 25 years.[ref]Statistically significant at the 1% level, even when controlling for GDP per capita in 2016 (using World Bank PPP data)[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/global-hunger-index-in-2017-vs-population-growth-1992-2015-un-population-division" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;

It is important to see though that among the countries for which we have GHI scores in both 1992 and 2017, the level of hunger went down in all but one (Iraq). Over the same period population went up in almost every case. Moreover, those countries that experienced higher levels of population growth in fact saw aÂ <em>bigger</em>Â drop in their GHI score over this period.[ref]This relationship is significant at the 1% level. The relationship is stronger (both in magnitude and significance) controlling for GDP per capita (using World Bank PPP data)[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/change-in-global-hunger-index-1992-2017-global-hunger-index-2017-vs-population-growth-1992-2015-un-population-division" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

The countries that saw high population growth over this period started with higher levels of hunger in 1992. So what we are seeing here is that countries areÂ <em>converging </em>towards lower levels of hunger: it fell quickest in countries with the highest levels of hunger, as we can see in the chart below.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/change-in-global-hunger-index-1992-2017-vs-global-hunger-index-in-1992" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;

So whilst countries that experience hunger do tend to have high levels of population growth, the idea that population growth necessarily leads toÂ <em>increased</em>Â hunger is clearly mistaken: many countries with high population growth have recently managed to decrease levels of hunger substantially.
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
Environmental degradation, including climate change,Â <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6030e.pdf">does pose a threat to food security</a>, and the growth of human populations has undoubtedly exacerbated many environmental pressures. However, this represents only one aspect of the complex explanation of why so many people suffer and die from undernourishment today, despite their being adequate food available for consumption globally.[ref]World food supply per person is higher than the Average Dietary Energy Requirements of all countries. See our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person">Food per Person</a> for more details.[/ref]

'Malthusian' explanations of famine and hunger thus fall short for the following reasons, the evidence for which we reviewed above:
<ul>
 	<li>Per capita food supply has increased as populations have grown, largely due to increasing yields.</li>
 	<li>Famine deaths have decreased, not increased, with population growth.</li>
 	<li>Food scarcity has played a smaller role in famines than suggested by the Malthusian narrative.Â It ignores other factors like conflict, poverty, access to markets,Â healthcare systems, and political institutions.</li>
 	<li>Population growth is high where hunger is high, but that does not mean that population growth makes hunger inevitable. On the contrary, we see that hunger has fallen fastest in countries with high population growth.</li>
</ul>
If we want to put an end to hunger, we need to understand the diverse causes that bring it about. Oversimplifications that mistakenly see hunger and famine as an inevitable consequence of population growth do not contribute to this end.";s:10:"post_title";s:49:"Does population growth lead to hunger and famine?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:29:"population-growth-and-famines";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-04-03 16:53:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-04-03 15:53:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=16619";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:15;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16846";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"17";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-14 11:51:48";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-14 11:51:48";s:12:"post_content";s:14507:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entries on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Causes of Death</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrorism</a></strong>, andÂ <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Catastrophes</a></strong>.</div>
Last year the BritishÂ <em>Royal Statistical Society</em> (RSS) awarded its inaugural <a href="http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/Get_involved/Statistic_of_the_year/RSS/Get_involved/Statistic_of_the_Year_.aspx?hkey=e5008987-fab9-4385-9110-4287e487b8d6"><em>International Statistic of 2017</em></a>Â to 'the number 69' because this is the "annual number of Americans killed, on average, by lawnmowers â€“ compared to two Americans killed annually, on average, by immigrant Jihadist terrorists."

This choice sparked controversy between those who consider such figures to be important in understanding relative risks of death, and those who see such comparisons as invalid and misleading.

In this blog we take a look at the scale of deaths from volatile events (here our focus on terrorist attacks and natural disasters), the dangers of relying on statistics from a single year to define risk levels, and whether in light of such evidence, it is still useful to compare their incidence to other causes of death.[ref]The term 'volatile' or 'volatility' is most often used within finance to describe sharp and unpredictable shocks or changes in trading prices or returns (as defined by the standard deviation). This concept, however, can be applied much more broadly to describe events or scenarios with high levels of instability and unpredictability. This concept is explored much more thoroughly in Nassim Taleb's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable"><em>The Black Swan</em></a>.[/ref]
<h3>Global deaths from terrorism and natural disasters</h3>
Look at the global breakdown of deaths in the chart below for the year 2016. Terrorism- and disaster-related deaths rank very low on the list. In 2016, terrorism and natural disasters combined accounted for less than 0.1 percent of global deaths (0.06 and 0.01 percent, respectively).[ref]These figures can also be found in absolute numbers of deaths <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause">here</a>.[/ref]

As we discuss in our blog post on '<a href="https://owid.cloud/what-does-the-world-die-from/">What does the world die from?</a>', the very low share of terrorism and disaster-related deaths was consistent across most countries in 2016, but not all countries: In several countries, including Iraq, Syria, and Libya, terrorism deaths ranked within the top ten causes.[ref]There were no disaster events in 2016 which were large enough to have a dramatic impact on the low ranking of natural disasters in any single country. However, this is strongly dependent on the year â€“ as we explore later in this blog.[/ref] It is therefore inaccurate to draw the broad conclusion that the incidence of terrorism deaths is very low everywhere.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

It is equally inaccurate to extrapolate or conclude that, based on a single-year snapshot in 2016, the risk of terror-related or natural disaster mortality is very low. Why is this the case?

Terror and disaster-related deaths are different from most other causes of death because of their high volatility. For most causes of death â€“ such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, malaria, homicide, suicide, and even road accidentsÂ â€“ the year-to-year changes are small (you can explore the range of trends for Causes of Death in our entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death">here</a>). Some are increasing or declining over time â€“ for example, deaths <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria#malaria-death-estimates-from-who">from malaria</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids#deaths-from-aids">HIV/AIDS</a> are falling â€“, but these are slow, gradual changes. The death rates from most causes of death in 2016 is a good predictor of death rates in 2017.

This rule-of-thumb does not apply to deaths related to terrorism or natural disasters. For such volatile cases, deaths can be very low (even zero) for an extended period of time, and then suddenly experience a single-year spike as a result of a large event or even a series of events. Predicting an annual death toll based on the past is therefore less reliable. To have a high degree of confidence in getting it right, I would have to place a large range of error on my estimate: several orders of magnitude in fact.

Let's look at two cases â€“ the 2001 9/11 terror attacks in the United States, and the 2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami (which triggered the Fukushima disaster) in Japan.
<h3>Terrorism deaths</h3>
In an <em>average</em> year in the United States, the number of deaths from terrorism is very, very low. In 2016, it accounted for an estimated 68 deaths (0.002 percent of total US deaths). Communicating this low level of relative risk was the primary aim of the RSS's choice of <a href="http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/Get_involved/Statistic_of_the_year/RSS/Get_involved/Statistic_of_the_Year_.aspx?hkey=e5008987-fab9-4385-9110-4287e487b8d6"><em>International Statistic of 2017</em></a>. What this statistic fails to capture however is the inherent volatility in this level of frequency.

In the chart below we see the number of fatalities from terrorist attacks in the United States, based on published data and definitions from the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Terrorism Database</a> (GTD) from 1970 to 2016. For almost the entirety of this 46-year timespan, we see that annual deaths are typically in the range of single digits or tens of deaths.

Then we see a major spike: the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 which killed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_September_11_attacks">approximately 3,000 people</a>Â â€“ most estimates are close to this figure; reported mortality from the GTD are 3005 deaths. Within the context of this 40 to 50 year trend, this is a dramatic outlier. Within a single year, deaths increased two to three orders of magnitude. Such dramatic spikes are not seen across most causes of death.

This is why we must therefore introduce caution â€“ and perhaps treat such deaths differently â€“ when assessing probability or risk. If we were to take the average annual deaths over this period, or the years spanning 1970 to 2000, we could otherwise make the mistake of concluding that our risk from such events was close to zero. In 2001 we would have been wrong.

How did the 9/11 terrorist attacks impact on terrorism's share of total deaths in the United States? In the charts below we see causes of death in the US in 2001 ranked by absolute numbers, and their percentage of total deaths. In 2001, terrorism accounted for 0.13 percent of US deaths. It is true that this is several orders of magnitude higher, and has climbed several ranking places versus 2016. It is also true that it still places relatively low within total deathsÂ â€“ one out of 770 deaths was caused by terrorism.

Is it possible that terrorism could ever fall within some of the top causes of death in the United States? To account for more than one percent of deaths (which would place it in the top ten), mortality would have to increase by a further order of magnitude from the 9/11 attacks, to more than 30,000 deaths. Such a high death toll would be unprecedented; only in the last few years have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fatalities-from-terrorism">global terrorism deaths</a> exceeded 30,000, and only in Iraq have deaths from terrorism exceeded 10,000 per year.[ref]This statement refers to the GTD data from 1970 onwards.[/ref] The probability of such an occurrence is likely to be very low, although impossible to rule out completely.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-deaths-by-cause-2001?country=USA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2001?country=USA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Natural disaster deaths</h3>
Natural disaster events show similar volatility. Let's look at the example of theÂ 2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In the chart below we see annual deaths from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes">natural catastrophes</a> (which includes earthquakes, tsunamis, extreme weather, heatwaves, floods, volcanic activity, and wildfire) for Japan in the period since 1990. In a typical year in Japan we see deaths from natural disasters amounting to tens or hundreds of people. This places it at â€“ or very close â€“ to the bottom of the rankings in causes of death in an average year.

However, in 2011 we see the dramatic impact of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed over 19,000. Like our example of terrorism in the United States, this represented an increase of several orders of magnitude relative to the longer-term average. Natural disaster events â€“ usually those of earthquakes or tsunamis which are highly unpredictable and difficult to react to â€“ produce similar volatile results across the world. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2004 Sumatra tsunami in the Indian Ocean show dramatic <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/natural-disaster-deaths-ihme?tab=chart&amp;country=HTI+IDN+LKA+IND+THA+MDV+MYS">instances of such trends</a>; more than 230,000 died in the Haiti earthquake, and an estimated 230,000 across countries were killed by the 2004 Sumatra tsunami.

Instances of such events are by nature volatile and unpredictable; interpreting annual risk for a given year based on data from previous years is highly speculative, if not impossible.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/natural-disaster-deaths-ihme?tab=chart&amp;country=JPN" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-deaths-by-cause-2011?country=JPN" width="300" height="150"></iframe>In the charts below â€“ which presents absolute numbers of death, and each cause as a percentage of total deaths â€“ we see the impact of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Natural disasters climbed significantly up the list of causes of death, falling just under the top ten, and accounting for 1.5 percent of total deaths. The results in the case of Haiti are dramatic: total deaths over the past few decades have averaged around 100,000 per year. In 2010, total deaths <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-age-group?country=HTI">more than tripled</a> to 335,000 with natural disaster deaths accounting for almost 70 percent of the total.Â  <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2011?country=JPN" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Treating comparisons of volatile and non-volatile events with caution</h3>
These examples highlight the volatile nature of low frequency, (potentially) high-impact events and their effects within the overall scale of mortality causes. How does this affect the validity of making such comparisons? Is it useful to do so?

If we reflect on the split reactions such comparisons typically create, I think both sides have a valid case to make. It is true that many tend to overestimate the incidence of terrorism and disaster-related events, especially relative to other causes of death. Single, high-impact events tend to claim breaking news and newspaper headlines; this can give the impression of heightened risk from such causes. Risk from other and dominating causes, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, and road accidents receive significantly less attention because they areÂ  persistent.

It is also true, however, that assessing risk and incidence of volatile events from a single year is misleading. Looking at mortality trends within a wider context (both temporally and geographically) is essential to assess the potential impact of such events. Equally important is to be aware that historical trends cannot be used to interpret theÂ <em>maximal</em> scale of future events. We cannot conclude that 3000 deaths is an upper limit of terrorism deaths in the United States, just as we cannot assume that an earthquake or tsunami will not kill more 19,000 in Japan in the future.

We must therefore treat comparisons between volatile and non-volatile events with caution. The instance of a 'low' year for terrorism or disaster-related deaths should not be interpreted with complacency; death tolls from such events may in fact be low partly as a result of mitigation efforts against them. If <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes#deaths-from-natural-disasters">we look at the number of deaths</a> from natural disasters over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, we see a significant decline over time â€“ not as a result of fewer events, but from more emphasis on adaptation and resilience measures against them.[ref]Lacasse, S., &amp; Nadim, F. (2011). Learning to live with geohazards: from research to practice. InÂ <i>Geo-Risk 2011: Risk Assessment and Management</i>Â (pp. 64-116).

This post introduces our <strong><a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Tracker</a></strong>.</div>
In 2015 the world set a new sustainable development agenda, pledging within the United Nations (UN) to achieve 17 development goals by 2030: The <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Sustainable Development Goals</em></a> (also known as <em>The Global Goals</em>). Ranging from eradicating poverty, to ensuring clean energy for all, to reaching sustainable levels of consumption, the array of targets across these goals were selected to drive our efforts in the 15 years up to 2030.

To track progress towards these goals it is necessary to measure how these indicators are changing for all countries around the world and developing an interactive hub where people across the world can explore global or country-level progress seems like an obvious step. However, we were surprised to find that there are currently no resources which do exactly this. There are particular databasesÂ â€” such as the UN's <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDG Indicators Global Database</a> â€” where raw data and metrics are available to download. But no website to date tracks the progress towards the SDGs in an engaging way that everyone can interact with.

We have therefore created a first <em>prototype</em> of this website â€“ theÂ <a href="http://sdg-tracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OurWorldinData-integ<wbr />rated SDG Tracker</a>.

Our site presents all of the official UN metrics and additional visualizations relevant to each target, where data is available. You will also notice that data is poor or not available for some targets â€” understanding where major data gaps lie is also an important task in tracking progress.

This SDG Tracker links in closely with all of what we cover at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a>. It is in essence an organized summary of many of the trends you find across our publication. Across each goal we highlight the relevant sections of the site where you will find longer-term and additional data and analysis on particular topics. This tracker in its current form is the first prototype of its kind; it is a project we aim to expand upon and keep up-to-date. To help us make it as useful as possible, we are keen to hear your feedback on what works well, what we could do better, and how to extend the reach of SDG engagement as widely as possible. If you have any thoughts, please don't hesitate to get in touch via the 'Feedback' option in the footer of the site.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.</div>
This article is the second of a pair of blogs which consider the relationship between famines and population growth. In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines">the first</a>Â we look at whether population growth is the dominant driver of famine and hunger. Here we consider the demographic impacts of famines, and in particular the extent to which famines may curb population growth.
<h3>The ultimate 'check'?</h3>
English political economist, Thomas Robert Malthus, writing at the turn of the 19th century, is famous for describing famine as "<em>the last, the most dreadful resource of nature</em>" which acts to "<em>levelÂ the population with the food of the world"</em>Â should other forces fail to lower birth rates or increase death rates.[ref] Malthus T.R. 1798.Â <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. Chapter VII, p 44.[/ref]

We can think of this â€˜Malthusianâ€™ proposition as containing two separate hypotheses: firstly, that unabated population growth ultimately leads to famine; secondly, that famine acts as a â€˜checkâ€™ to population in this eventuality.

As we explored in ourÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines">previousÂ post</a>, recent trends in famine mortality, and hunger more generally, largely contradict the first hypothesis. In this post here we investigate the second, by considering the contribution of famines to long-run population trends. What role has famine played in shaping birth and mortality rates throughout history?

We begin by considering two examples of famines which, from a demographic point of view, differ enormously: the Chinese famine of 1959-61 and that in Ireland in the late 1840s.
<h3>China's 'Great Leap Forward' famine</h3>
The 'Great Leap Forward'-famine in China from 1959-61 was the single largest famine in history in terms of absolute numbers of deaths. Excess mortality estimates vary hugely, but based on our midpoint estimates, it cost more than double the number of lives than any other famine. Our table of famine mortality estimates is available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">here</a>. The chart below shows the estimated changes to birth and death rates during and after this famine period, in addition to the effect of these changes on overall population size. Alongside a significant jump in death rates, there was also a large fall in births â€” a trend very typical of famines.[ref]See for instance the summary of famine demography in Ã“ GrÃ¡da (2009) <em>Famine: A Short History</em>. Princeton.[/ref] However, this was immediately followed by a spike in birth rates in the years immediately following the famine, offsetting to a large degree its demographic effect. This was followed by a steady decline in birth rates throughout the 1960s and 70s, concurrent with domestic birth control policies, but also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL+CHN+TWN+IND+BRA">in line with many other rapidly developing countries</a>.

The trend in mortality rates is similar: the peak generated by the crisis was followed by a continued decline that forms part of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#changes-to-birth-and-death-rate-over-time-around-the-world">common experience of countries</a> as they develop. The key thing to note is that these secular shifts in births and deaths far outweigh the short-lived impact of the famine in determining the long-run trajectory of population growth in China. Despite causing an excess mortality of 2-5% of the total population, and a similar number of 'lost births', we can see from the lower panel in the chart below the famine had next to no discernible impact on population in the long run.

&nbsp;
<h6>Long-term demographic impact of China's Great Leap Forward Famine[ref]
Data up to 1982 are taken from Luo, S. (1988) 'Reconstruction of life tables and age distributions for the population of China, by year, from 1953 to 1982'. Data from 1983 are taken from the World Bank.[/ref]</h6>

&nbsp;
<h3>The Great Irish Famine</h3>
This picture contrasts somewhat with the developments followingÂ the Great Irish Famine of the late 1840s, as shown in the chart below. After a period of rapid growth that brought the population to over 8 million, a famine struck that was, in relation to the country's population, far more severe than the 'Great Leap Forward'-famine. It is thought to have reduced the population by about one quarter in its immediate effects: one million perishing and a further million emigrating.Â But one striking feature of Irish demographics is how the population then continued to shrink following the famine. By 1911 there were in Ireland about half as many people as in 1841. The population only began to grow again in the late 20th century. Is this then an example of a country that learnt from its 'Malthusian lesson'?
<h6>Population of the Island of Ireland, 1500-2000[ref]
Population figures are from Clio-Infra (2016), except for Ireland from 1920 onwards which in the original data refer to the Republic of Ireland only. We add to this population figures for Northern Ireland, based on census data.[/ref]</h6>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-country-island-of-ireland-figures" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

This continued depopulation was partly due to low birth rates (which were considerably lower than in England and Scotland in the second half of the 19th century) and partly due to very high levels of outward migration, particularly to the US and Great Britain. Between 1851 and 1900, there were almost as many outward migrants as there were deaths in Ireland (4.18 million and 4.56 million, respectively)[ref]According to John Fitzgerald, President of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in his <a href="http://edepositireland.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/79414/7%20fitzgerald.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">May 2016 Presidential Address</a>. [/ref]. According toÂ Cormac Ã“ GrÃ¡da, "<em>during the decades between the Great Famine and World War One the probability of a young Irishman or Irishwoman not emigrating was less than one in two.</em>"

&nbsp;

As Ã“ GrÃ¡da argues, the only way a famine can have any real lasting demographic impact is if it "teaches" the population to alter marriage and family planning practices to reduce fertility rates.[ref]Ã“ GrÃ¡da, <em>Famine: A Short History,Â </em>2009.[/ref] There is some evidence of changing behaviour in Ireland following the famine, including more people choosing to marry later or not all. However it is difficult to know if this is directly attributable to the famine, or if it instead reflects people's responses to other changes taking place at the time, such as increasing life expectancy or increasing incomes. Furthermore, whilst total birth rates were low in the post-famine period, the number of children being born to married couples remained high, and the rate of natural increase was highest in those parts of the country worst hit by the famine, complicating any simple explanation along these lines. Similarly, whilst the famine itself clearly provided the impetus for mass emigration, high levels of outward migration began some decades before the famine and continued long afterwards in the context of a much-ameliorated standard of living. Thus, it seems likely that it was the promise of improved economic opportunities, rather than fear of famine which drove emigration between 1851 and 1900.[ref]SeeÂ Ã“ GrÃ¡da,Â <em>The population of Ireland 1700-1900 : a survey.</em>Â Annales de DÃ©mographie Historique, 1979[/ref]

Overall then, even in this seemingly paradigmatic â€˜Malthusianâ€™ example, whilst Ireland undoubtedly did suffer some lasting demographic impacts from the famine, subsequent economic and social developments unrelated to the famine explain the majority of the depopulation the country experienced in the decades following it.
<h3>The role of 'crises' in long-run population trends</h3>
But what can we say about the impact of famines on long-term population trends more generally? Â To help answer this question, we look instead at the role of 'population crises' of all kinds â€“ that is to say severe spikes in mortality in general, not just those due to famine. What impact have such crises played in shaping population trends, relative to other global developments?

Below are two charts showing the historic evolution of death rates in England and Wales, and in Norway. Data points mark the annual 'Crude Death Rate' (total deaths per 1,000 people) in each country, and a line plotting the 20-year moving average is shown in each case. You can see that the decline in average mortality rates in both countries was preceded by a reduction in the<em> spread</em>Â around the average i.e., the number and extent of 'crises' of high mortality.[ref]Note that the distribution is skewed: there are no major 'crises' of survival, with mortality rates far below the average. For earlier periods, death rates are extrapolated from parish records, and imprecision in the estimation possibly contributes to the variance.[/ref]
<h6>Historic crude death rates in England and Wales and Norway</h6>
<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/England-death-rates.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17897" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/England-death-rates-750x525.png" alt="" width="750" height="525" /></a>

&nbsp;

However, when such spikes were common, they in fact played a relatively small part in keeping average mortality rates as high as they were. Economic Historian, Robert Fogel, in considering the data for England concludes that <em>"crisis mortality</em>[ref]Here he defines this as a CDR that is more than 10% above the 25-year moving average[/ref] <em>[including famine] accounted for less than 5 percent of total mortality in England prior to 1800 and the elimination of crisis mortality accounted for just 15 percent of the decline in total mortality between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."</em>[ref]Fogel, R. <em>Second Thoughts on the European Escape from Hunger: Famines, Price Elasticities, Entitlements, Chronic Malnutrition, and Mortality</em> Rates. NBER Historical Working Paper No. 1. 1989[/ref] You can picture this by imagining what would happen if you took the highest points in the charts above â€“ representing the crises in mortality â€“ and moved them downwards towards the average for that time. The line showing the 20-year moving average would indeed fall, but only by a small amount compared to the overall decline.

Falling death rates, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">increasing life expectancy</a>, are trends that took place first in early industrialising countries, but have been a common experience in all parts of the world as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-at-higher-poverty-lines">poverty has declined</a>, andÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta">healthcare</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions">nutrition</a>Â has improved. But since the 1960s this has been outpaced by a fall in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">birth rates</a>,Â such that overall theÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth">global population growth</a>Â rate has been steadily falling, and is likely to approach zero towards the end of this century.Â The rapid growth in population witnessed since the early 20th century was due to the fall in death rates happening ahead of the fall in birth rates, generating a period of natural increase in between.

This is known as the '<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>': a shift from stable populations with high birth and death rates to stable populations with low birth and death rates, with a period of rapid increase in between due to the fall in mortality preceding the fall in fertility. The chart below shows this transition as it occurred in five very different countries. Here also we can see that the secular decline in death rates follow a reduction in its volatility. But again, the height of the peaks in earlier decades are generally small relative to the overall decline. Even larger crises, such as the "Great Leap Forward", or the spike in mortality in Mauritius in the late 1920s,[ref]TheÂ Wikipedia page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mauritius#British_rule_(1810â€“1968)">history of Mauritius</a> says thatÂ <em>"conflicts arose between the Indian community (mostly sugarcane labourers) and the Franco-Mauritians in the 1920s, leading to several â€“ mainly Indian â€“ deaths."</em>[/ref] translate into very small changes in overall population trends, if at all. Â It is the persistent long-term decline in 'normal' birth and death ratesÂ that represent the more significant development for population trends, not the absence of temporary mortality spikes.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
As with any living organism, humans cannot sustain a given population without sufficient energy resources. Given this, at first glance, it does seem intuitive to assume population growth and famines to be closely linked via food availability. The evidence that this post and <strong>its </strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines">companion piece</a>Â presents, however contradicts any simplified view of this relationship as it fails to acknowledge the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-far-fewer-people-die-in-famines-today">diverse causes of famines</a> and population dynamics.

The analogy to other living organisms can obscure what is different about the human species. We organize ourselves into complex social and political structures capable of incredible joint accomplishments â€“ such as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases">eradication of diseases</a> â€“ but also of inflicting, or consciously allowing, unimaginable suffering â€“ including the majority of famine deaths to date. The capacity of the planet to feed us <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture">is not a fixed constant</a>, imposed by nature, but rather depends also on us: on our agricultural practices, the development and transmission of knowledge and technology, and also crucially upon our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets">choice of diet</a> â€“ an inherently cultural act.

The population growth rate is now declining, not, thankfully, due to more frequent crises of mortality but because people, through their own volition, are choosing to have fewer children.Â This change is very much associated to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#increasing-prosperity-and-structural-transformation-of-the-economy">rising incomes</a> and other social developments in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#increasing-well-being-and-status-of-children">health</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#women-s-education">education</a>, and has tended to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#fertility-rates-can-decline-extremely-fast">happen more quickly</a> in countries that have developed more recently.Â If we need any generalization here, it isÂ <em>plenty</em>Â â€“ in terms of improved access to adequate food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education and so on â€“ rather thanÂ scarcity, that is slowing down our species' multiplication.

This isn't to say that increased populations and affluence haven't caused environmental damage, nor that this in turn poses no risks to our future well-being. But the idea we are helpless to stop famines in the face of high population growth in some parts of the world, or that famines represents any kind of 'solution' to the environmental problems humans are causing, as some Malthusians suggest, are two hypotheses that do little to help either humanity or the planet.

The differences between the economies of Switzerland and Guatemala go beyond differences in size. The Swiss economy has different inputs that can be used to produce a very different mix of outputs. In other words, the Swiss economy has different â€˜productive capabilitiesâ€™.

Productive capabilities are important to understand economic development. But, what exactly are productive capabilities? And how can we measure them?

Ricardo Hausmann and Cesar Hidalgo argue that productive capabilities are all the inputs, technologies and ideas that, in combination, determine the frontiers of what an economy can produce. They argue that productive capabilities include all sorts of things: infrastructure, land, laws, machines, people, books, and collective knowledge.

Since measuring and comparing such diverse and complex productive capabilities is difficult, Hausmann and Hidalgo <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/26/10570.full.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">propose</a> using a proxy, called the <em>Economic Complexity Index</em> (ECI), which tries to measure capabilities indirectly by looking at the mix of products that countries export. 

The assumption is that productive capabilities determine the number and quality of products that a country can export; so export bundles tell us something about the underlying productive capabilities. For example, we might infer that Switzerland and Japan have similar productive capabilities, because they are both able to produce a similar set of goods.

To use a metaphor: If economies are like restaurants, then productive capabilities are all the stuff that is needed in the kitchen; so the <em>Economic Complexity Index</em> ranks the restaurants by comparing the menus, rather than by comparing the recipes, food and people behind the kitchen doors.

In a nutshell, the ECI is an algorithm such that (i) restaurants that serve a more diverse and sophisticated menu are scored higher, and (ii) restaurants that serve similar menus have similar scores. 

<h4>A closer look at the Economic Complexity Index</h4>

The ECI takes data on exports, and reduces a countryâ€™s economic system into two dimensions: (i) The 'diversity' of products in the export basket, and (ii) the â€˜ubiquityâ€™ of products in the export basket. Diversity is the number of products that a country can export competitively. And ubiquity is the number of countries that are able to export a product competitively.

To measure these two dimensions, the ECI uses a cross-country export matrix. That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product exports.

Loosely speaking, the least complex countries, at the bottom of the ECI rank, are those that export very few different types of products (i.e. have export baskets that are not diversified) and those products that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e. export baskets that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products). 

By this logic, Germany ranks high in economic complexity, because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified productive capacities. 

The following chart shows ECI rankings for all countries in the world, over time.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-complexity-rankings?year=2012" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

MIT's <a href="https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/">Observatory of Economic Complexity</a> and Harvard's <a href="http://globe.cid.harvard.edu/">Atlas of Economic Complexity</a> are both great data visualisation websites that have much more data on ECI, countries' trade relationships, and the composition of traded goods.

<h4>From economic complexity to economic growth</h4>

The chart below shows the relationship between ECI rankings and GDP per capita. As we can see, there is a clear correlation: richer countries tend to rank higher in the ECI. The countries on the lower ranks of the ECI are much poorer than the high-ranked countries in the top-left corner.
 
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eci-ranking-vs-gdp-per-capita" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

In the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/26/10570.full.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">academic paper</a> where Hidalgo and Hausmann introduced their concept of â€˜economic complexityâ€™, they noted that the correlation between the ECI and GDP per capita is very robust; and they showed that, beyond this, the ECI actually predicts economic <em>growth</em> after statistically controlling for other baseline country characteristics. So countries with higher economic complexity than their level of GDP per capita would suggest, can be expected to grow faster. 

Consider, for example, Malaysia: As we can see in the chart above, Malaysia is further left along the horizontal axis than other countries located at the same height along the vertical axis. So, statistically speaking, it is likely that Malaysia will grow faster than these other countries.

The intuition for why economic complexity predicts growth can be understood in terms of unexploited productive potential. Countries that are below the income expected from their capability endowment, are countries that will likely shift towards the product-mix that is feasible with their existing capabilities, and which richer countries have already successfully developed.

This takes us to the main lesson from economic complexity: Different types of exports are associated with different economic outcomes. [ref]It's not only about GDP growth. In a recent paper Hartmann, D., Guevara, M.R., Jara-Figueroa, C., Aristaran, M., Hidalgo, C.A., suggest the ECI is a predictor of income inequality levels. They show that countries exporting more economically complex products have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting more ubiquitous products. Available online <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15309876">here</a>.[/ref]

This is in line with the well-studied phenomenon of â€˜premature de-industrializationâ€™. Emerging economies that fail to develop their manufacturing sector as they grow, are likely to suffer from lower growth prospects later down the line, because manufacturing industries tend to be particularly conducive to productivity growth. (You can read more about â€˜premature de-industrializationâ€™ in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/growth-and-structural-transformation-are-emerging-economies-industrializing-too-quickly" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our blog post here</a>.)

<h4>What does this mean in terms of economic policy? </h4>

The fact that different types of exports are associated with different economic outcomes suggests that policymakers should try to focus on relaxing specific productivity constraints in key sectors that are likely to unlock growth potential. 

Does this imply that countries that are less economically complex, as determined by the ECI, should focus on diversification? Not necessarily.

The <em>type</em> rather than the <em>number</em> of industries and occupations concentrated in a region might matter more for economic prosperity. So the objective of industrial policy should not be diversification per se.[ref]For more details on this see Mealy, P., Farmer, J., & Teytelboym, A. (2018). A New Interpretation of the Economic Complexity Index. Available online <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08245.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

Pinning down the â€˜key sectorsâ€™ and finding â€˜binding constraintsâ€™ is obviously difficult.

As discussed in more detail in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famine-mortality-over-the-long-run">previous post</a>, there has been a marked decline in the number of people dying in famines in recent decades, as shown in the chart below. It shows the estimated number of people dying due to famine in each decade since 1860, split by continent. It is based on our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">dataset of famines</a>.

But does this recent fall really represent a permanent shift, or are we merely witnessing a chance, temporary pause?

To help answer this question, we draw on a recent article by famine researcher Alex de Waal in which he puts forward a number factors that explain the recent reduction in famine mortality.[ref]de Waal, A., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.09.004">The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action</a>, Political Geography (2017)[/ref] Whilst a range of triggers for food crises persist today â€“ with conflict remaining particularly salient â€“ there is a reduced tendency for such crises to translate into episodes of mass mortality. This reduced vulnerability can be linked to a number of long-term global developments, some of which we outline some below. In each case, we provide links to entries across Our World In Data in which you can find more information.

<strong>Increased food supply</strong>

It is natural to link the reduced famine mortality to the significant increases in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person">food per person</a>Â seen in recent decades, driven primarily by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-vs-land-use-how-has-the-world-produced-enough-food-for-a-growing-population">increasing yields</a>. This, for instance, seems particularly salient in the case of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-per-capita-supply-of-calories?country=CHN+IND+OWID_WRL">China and India</a>, which between them account for well over half of the famine deaths since 1860. Whilst increases in agricultural productivity did contribute to a reduction in global poverty and reduced levels of hunger, the role of food supply per capita in relation toÂ <em>famines</em>Â is often overemphasised.[ref]Sen's work on entitlements, for instance, marked a more general shift away from the assumption of 'Food Availability Decline' as the default explanation for famines. See, for instance, his 1981 book <em>Poverty and Famines</em>. Stephen Devereux sets this shift in the context of the history of famine scholarship in his 2000 working paper <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf"><em>Famine in the Twentieth Century</em></a>.[/ref] The decline in famine mortality is, rather, the joint outcome of a broader range global developments, including the following.

<strong>Improved health</strong>

The general improvement in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta">global health</a>Â has undoubtedly played a huge role in reducing famine mortality.[ref]Indeed, de Waal (2017) suggests this may be the single most important factor.[/ref] In most famines the great majority of victims do not die as a direct result of starvation, but ratherÂ succumb to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#poor-health-and-infectious-diseases">infectious disease or other illnesses</a>, with some diseases being more directly linked to diet than others. As such, the great strides made in public health, including widespread <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/">vaccination coverage</a>, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#smallpox">eradication of smallpox</a>, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria#malaria-prevalence-historically">reduced prevalence of malaria</a> in many parts of the world, and improvements in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation">access to clean water and sanitation</a>, will have contributed greatly to the general reduction of mortality during food crises.

<strong>Reduced poverty</strong>

As Amartya Sen argued, the fact that there may be enough food available in aggregate within a given area does not necessarily mean that everyone will be able to <em>afford</em> it.[ref]Sen, A, <em>Poverty and Famines</em>. Available online <a href="http://staging.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/1981/81B09_608_engl.pdf">here</a>.[/ref] Unsurprisingly, famines, with few exceptions, happen in very poor countries. As we can see below, most countries in which a famine took place had, at the time, very, very low incomes â€“ indeed the average incomes were commonly less than half of that of the UK at the outset of its industrial revolution.

Whilst this refers to average incomes, richer countries also generally have far fewer people living inÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#the-link-between-economic-growth-and-poverty">extreme poverty</a>, both because of higher incomes before tax and benefits, but also due <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#high-income-countries-spend-more-on-social-protection-than-low-income-countries">higher government expenditures and transfers</a>. Higher national incomes are also associated with a range of other improvements in health and physical infrastructure that have also contributed to reducing famine mortality. Thus recent <a href="https://owid.cloud/economic-growth">economic growth</a> â€“ most notably that in India and China which, throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries suffered heavily from famine â€“ has played an important role in the fall in famine deaths.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famines-and-GDP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17545" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famines-and-GDP-750x488.png" alt="" width="750" height="488" /></a>

<strong>Democratization</strong>

The overwhelming majority of famine deaths occurred in crises due to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#war-and-famines">conflict</a> or with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#democracy-oppression-and-conflict">overt political causes</a>: Amartya Sen is also known for his observationÂ that <em>â€œthere has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracyâ€</em>.[ref]<em>Development as Freedom</em>Â (1999)[/ref] Whilst there are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#democracy-oppression-and-conflict">some exceptions</a> to this rule that can be debated, the main idea is borne out by historical record.

Thomas PlÃ¼mper and Eric Neumayer (2007) note that a number of smaller-scale events in which drought-related mortality did occur <em>have</em> happened in functioning democracies.[ref]PlÃ¼mper, Thomas and Neumayer, Eric (2007) <em>Famine mortality, rational political inactivity, and international food aid</em>. PSPE working papers, 02-2007. Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. Available online <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/25169/1/PSPE_WP2_07_%28LSERO%29.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]Â But they show that democratic institutions are associated with reduced mortality in famines, and also a more effective translation of food aid into fewer deaths. The spread of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracy">democratic institutions</a> can, therefore, be considered to have contributed to the decline in famine mortality too.

<strong>Demographic transition</strong>

The world is approaching what the late Hans Rosling called â€œthe age of peak childâ€: the number of births globally has flattened out and we are not far away from the largest cohort of children that there will likely ever be, as we show in <a href="http://â€œ&lt;a href=">the age of peak child</a>â€"&gt;our post on peak child.

This is relevant to famine trends because children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable, usually accounting forÂ between one half and two thirds of all excess deaths in famines.[ref]de Waal (2017)[/ref] Whilst the absolute number of children has increased, the fraction of the world population that this vulnerable age group makes up has decreased, and will continue to do so. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#demographic-transition">Demographic transition</a>Â makes the occurrence of famines with very high mortality ratesÂ increasing less likely, both at a global level and as it unfolds in individual countries.
<h3>Famines in the future</h3>
Importantly, our famine data does not include any information on the ongoing food crises in Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria, or elsewhere, including the recent period in which South Sudan was officially declared to be in famine.[ref]For more information on these, see the <a href="http://www.fews.net">Famine Early Warning System</a> website.[/ref] We are, as yet, unaware of any mortality estimates in each case. However, such crises are translating into world hunger levels that do appear to be <a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/">on the rise</a>.

One of the key causes of both famine and food insecurity more generally is conflict. This is as true today as in previous eras.Â Looking at the previous chart, you can see that a number of significant famines occurred in richer countries around the two World Wars, often in strategic blockades of civilian populations. Many of the most <a href="http://www.fews.net">severe food crises</a> today are also being driven by conflict that can cause disruption to livelihoods, trade and humanitarian access, and often involve outright human rights abuses.[ref]This aspect of famines is described in more detail in the Word Peace Foundation's <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/">Famine Trends</a>Â website, as well as de Waal (2017)[/ref]

Given this continued potential for populations' food security to be undermined, either as a byproduct, or as a direct strategy of conflict there is nothing 'automatic' about famine mortality remaining at the low levels seen in recent years. Furthermore, climate change â€” in particular the increased frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, and crop pest and disease risks â€” presents a long-term <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6030e.pdf">threat to food security</a>. However, the global changes that together help explain the recent dramatic reduction in famine mortality â€“ improved health, reduced poverty, the spread of democratic institutions,Â demographic shifts â€“ represent fundamental long-term developments. As such, it seems unlikely that famine mortality could return to the kinds of levels witnessed in previous centuries any time soon.

Public debates on climate change frequently exhibit a misunderstanding â€“ namely that decarbonisation of our economies necessarily conflicts with economic growth. Ironically, the proponents of this claim come from two antagonistic camps. On the one hand, there are those who believe that addressing climate change must take priority and that this requires an organised diminution of economic output (termed â€œdegrowthâ€). On the other hand, there are those who believe that economic growth and the social stability that comes with it should be prioritised: concerning oneself with climate policy should not be a priority if it impacts competitiveness.
<h3>The technological feasibility of decoupling emissions</h3>
One key distinction to elucidate the debate is between the technological and the political feasibility of â€œdecouplingâ€ of <a href="https://owid.cloud/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">emissions</a> from <a href="https://owid.cloud/economic-growth">growth</a>. Decoupling can be relative (when rates of economic growth are higher than rates of emissions growth) or absolute (when emissions fall in absolute terms even as the economy continues to grow). A further question only indirectly related to climate change mitigation is whether human well-being itself can be decoupled from economic growth.

This post focuses on the <em>technological feasibility</em> of absolute decoupling. Any cogent claim about appropriate responses to environmental problems must start with a normative benchmark, which for climate change mitigation is provided by assessments of optimal technology deployment and demand restructuring. Whether or not the optimal mix of relevant technologies is politically feasible is a different question entirely, but the two must be distinguished clearly for coherent policy advice.

Indeed much sophisticated modelling has been carried out to show that the transformation to carbon-free economies is technologically feasible.[ref]Clarke L., K. Jiang, K. Akimoto, M. Babiker, G. Blanford, K. Fisher-Vanden, J.-C. Hourcade, V. Krey, E. Kriegler, A. LÃ¶schel,

Global decoupling is not yet happening: Although annual global emissions have been stable in 2014-2016, they rose again in 2017.[ref]Jackson et al. (2017). Warning Signs for Stabilising global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Available <a href="ttp://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa9662/meta">online</a>.[/ref] However, it would be premature to draw conclusions about the future based on past trends.
<h3>Emission-intensive sectors are only a minor part of the economy</h3>
Our data[ref]World Input-Output Database 2013 release [Timmer, M. P., Dietzenbacher, E., Los, B., Stehrer, R. and de Vries, G. J. (2015),"An Illustrated User Guide to the World Inputâ€“Output Database: the Case of Global Automotive Production", Review of International Economics., 23: 575â€“605]. Year 2009 in basic prices, value added computed as net sectoral output (gross sectoral output less sectoral input).[/ref] illustrates one major reason behind the modelling consensus that decarbonisation and economic growth are compatible: in rich countries, sectors contributing most to economic output typically do not contribute to emissions significantly (Figure 1).Â Further, in many sectors absolute decoupling has been happening (Figure 2). This is true across such diverse economies as China, Germany and the United States (as shown in the three charts of Figure 1).
<h6>Figure 1: Contribution of individual sectors to net economic output and total country emissions in 2009. Sectors above the line contribute more to the value added than emissions of the country.</h6>

So if the most powerful economic sectors are not emissions intensive, then regulating emissions need not affect economic prosperity or output in developed economies. The virtual economy and high-skilled jobs have grown disproportionately faster than heavy industry (Figure 2) in the recent past. Even in China, the service sector has grown from contributing 24% to total economic output in 1995 to 33% in 2009, when most of the emissions â€œexportedâ€ from high to lower-income countries went to Chinese manufacturing. In the United States the service sector contribution has increased from 52% to 58% and in Germany from 50% to 55%. This growth in services has arisen mostly at the expense of heavy industry (which fell from 17.5% to 14.7% and 27% to 23%, in the USA and Germany, respectively), in addition to a fall in China's agricultural contribution. This is particularly notable in China, a country to which polluting industry has often been exported; the vast majority of all sectors have experienced much faster growth in economic output than in emissions. Thus, relative decoupling is a technical feasibility.
<h6>Figure 2: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions<sub>Â </sub>growth of individual sectors between 1995 and 2009 (adjusted for inflation). Sectors in the top left quadrant have decoupled their emissions from economic growth - whilst their emissions fell, their economic value grew.</h6>

On the other hand, Figure 1 shows that the sector that contributes by far the most emissions is energy and electricity generation, in Germany in 2009 it accounted for 51% of emissions and less than 3% of value added. Decarbonisation of the energy sector would thus contribute greatly to the decarbonisation of the economy without significantly affecting overall economic output, as a first approximation. Clearly, supply chains connect the growth and size of economic sectors. For instance, the digital economy requires a notable amount of electricity and material infrastructure. Yet, decarbonising the supplying sectors allows economic growth of the whole sectoral chain without a parallel growth in emissions.
<h3>The three main arguments why growth and decarbonisation are compatible</h3>
However, is this argument about the separation of economically important and emission-intensive sectors naÃ¯ve?Â  After all, in the past, sustained economic growth has always coincided with growth in emissions. This objection is intuitive, but equates a correlation from a time with little political effort in climate protection with causation. We next revisit the main conceptual arguments behind why modelling consistently shows decarbonisation and economic growth are compatible under optimal policy.

Beyond our simple plots that disentangle value added and emissions by sector, three further arguments make the equivalence of economic output growth and increasing emissions implausible. First, the fast development and high deployment of renewable energy technologies has brought down their production costs so far that for the first time, deploying solar and wind renewables is cheaper, on a life-cycle cost basis, than building fossil power stations.[ref]See Lazard's <a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/">Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE)</a> Analysis, and Creutzig et al. (2017). The underestimated potential of solar energy to mitigate climate change.Â <em>Nature</em> Energy, <strong>2</strong>. Available <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2017140">online</a>.[/ref]

Second, economies have been remarkably reactive to price signals and easily overcame substantial constraints in the past.[ref]See, for example, Beckert, S. (2004). Emancipation and Empire: Reconstructing the Worldwide Web of Cotton Production in the Age of the American Civil War.Â <i>The American Historical Review,</i>Â <i>109</i>(5), 1405-1438. Available <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530931?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">online</a>.[/ref] As resources become scarcer and prices increase, opportunities for substitutes arise. On an individual level, substantial price changes, even on fuel, do reduce demand.[ref]Zimmer, A., &amp; Koch, N. (2017). Fuel consumption dynamics in Europe: Tax reform implications for air pollution and carbon emissions.Â <i>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice</i>,Â <i>106</i>, 22-50. Available <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856416307650">online</a>.[/ref] One can thus be optimistic about the development of low-carbon production technologies if substantial carbon prices are put in place. Historically, higher rates of economic growth have also been correlated with higher rates of innovation.[ref]Hasan, I., &amp; Tucci, C. L. (2010). The innovationâ€“economic growth nexus: Global evidence.Â <i>Research Policy</i>,Â <i>39</i>(10), 1264-1276. Available online.[/ref]

Third, low-carbon substitutes for some goods are indeed difficult to conceive at the timescales required to successfully address the <a href="http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world's climate targets</a>, including reaching carbon neutrality within the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Meat consumption and aviation are highly emissions-intensive activities for which this is a case in pointÂ â€” 'artificial meat' and 'electric planes' may take too long to become marketable to achieve these goals. However, as Figure 1 shows, these sectors are relatively small in terms of value added in developed economies. Therefore, reducing meat consumption and air transport, albeit partly controversial, should be feasible without large economic losses. One might go even further and question the interlinkage of consumption levels from these goods/services and societal well-being.[ref]Creutzig, F., Roy, J., Lamb, J. W. F., Azevedo, I. M. L., Bruine de Bruin, W., Dalkmann, H., Edelenbosch, O. Y., Geels, F.W., Grubler, A., Hepburn, C.,
Hertwich, E.G., Khosla, R., Mattauch, L.,Minx, J.C., Ramakrishnan, A., Rao, N.D., Steinberger, J.K.,Tavoni, M., Ãœrge-Vorsatz, D. and Weber, E.U. (2018).

Available <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0121-1">online</a>.[/ref] However, the last point raises intricate questions about what really matters for quality of life and what the 'good' society looks like.[ref]Mattauch, L., Ridgway, M., &amp; Creutzig, F. (2016). Happy or liberal? Making sense of behavior in transport policy design.Â <i>Transportation research part D: transport and environment</i>,Â <i>45</i>, 64-83.

These arguments have a significant implication for what governments should focus on in order to tackle climate change: curtail emissions in the highly emitting sectors! This can be achieved by levying a significant and reliable price on anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions - either through a tax or an emissions trading scheme. It will imply that appropriate low-carbon alternatives are developed.Â  If done well, this can even increase productivity and create additional economic growth, as a <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/news/good-climate-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent article</a> shows: aggregate investment is channeled from fossil resources into additional productive capital.[ref]Siegmeier, J., Mattauch, L., &amp; Edenhofer, O. (2018). Capital beats coal: How collecting the climate rent increases aggregate investment.Â <i>Journal of Environmental Economics and Management</i>, 88: 366â€”378. Available <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617308707">online</a>.[/ref] Alternatively, an outright ban on the most emissions-intensive economic activities, such as burning coal, would achieve equal results in terms of emissions reductions, but forgo some of the economic benefits of decarbonizing the economy by appropriate price signals. In countries in which strong mitigation policies are in place, such as Sweden and Switzerland, emissions are declining. It is true that a portion of these reductions may be attributed to carbon leakage â€“ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-emissions-and-prosperity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions are partly outsourced</a> as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/growth-and-structural-transformation-are-emerging-economies-industrializing-too-quickly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">production shifts</a> to poorer or less environmentally regulated countries.Yet if just a limited number of countries decarbonise, carbon leakage is only an obstacle to emission reductions as long as national economies do not impose tariffs on the carbon content of products they import.
<h3>Individual responsibility and sufficiency</h3>
While society at large has better alternatives to slowing growth, this is not necessarily true at the individual level. But what should an <em>individualÂ </em>do about climate change? While governments can target various sectors, consumers are limited to choose between already existing products. Information about emissions along the entire supply and production chain (including potential carbon leaks) are also typically lacking. Moreover, motivated individuals typically care about other dimensions of environmental sustainability, such as biodiversity and water use. Missing information and multiple objectives make product choice by individuals a different decision-making problem. Thus, at the private level, a more general sufficiency strategy of reducing material consumption overall may be appropriate.[ref]Wynes, S., &amp; Nicholas, K. A. (2017). The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions.Â <i>Environmental Research Letters</i>,Â <i>12</i>(7), 074024. Available <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541">online</a>.[/ref] Nonetheless, focusing on the most emissions-intensive activities such as road and air transport or meat consumption would make a certain contribution to climate change mitigation. Reducing material throughput is also strategy applicable at the economy-wide level; an example is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/towards-circular-economy_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Union Circular Economy policy</a><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">.</span>Â However, this has the purpose of creating innovation and redesigning waste contributing to energy efficiency.
<h3>Implications for climate policy</h3>
We conclude that contrasting climate protection with economic growth, as is so frequently done, is misleading. Economic growth emerges from individual instincts for improvements from billions of talented humans. Slowing down economic growth would mean suppressing that instinct, at enormous losses of individual freedom. So climate protection can only be successful by redirecting these instincts towards carbon-free production processes, creating a different sense of what is considered an improvement and, in rare cases, forgoing some benefits of irreplaceable high-carbon consumption options. Rather than emphasizing potential competitiveness concerns, debates about climate policy should focus on implementability of policy, political will and responsibility of actors, including private individuals.";s:10:"post_title";s:34:"Shrink emissions, not the
