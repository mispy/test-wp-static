Since the beginning of the 21st century, the WHO has published global estimates of the number of people that die from malaria. In these 15 years the global death toll has been cut in half: from 839,000 deaths in 2000 to 438,000 in 2015.

Africa is the world region that is most affected by malaria: In 2015, the African continent held 9 out of 10 malaria victims (click on 'Expanded' to see this). But Africa is also the world region that has achieved most progress: from 2000 to 2015, African deaths from malaria were reduced from 764,000 to 395,000.

A rare opportunity to see how values have changed in the US was discovered by Boxer et al (reference below) who compared surveys in which people were asked what they seek in a spouse. I took the first and last survey results reported by the authors and visualized it in the chart below: It allows us to compare the relative importance of these traits in 1939 and seven decades later. The big winner is 'mutual attraction ‚Äì love' which now ranks as the most important aspect for both women and men. But also 'Education, intelligence' and 'Sociability' rose in importance. The relative losers are 'Good Health' and at the very bottom 'Chastity'.

It is therefore especially surprising how very rapidly this transition can indeed happen.

This chart is an excerpt of the data-entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility">fertility</a> which shows much more data and explains why fertility is declining.

As we see from the chart below it took Iran only 10 years for fertility to fall from more than 6 children per woman to fewer than 3 children per woman. (Iran made this transition under a conservative Muslim government.)

We also see from the chart that the speed with which countries can achieve low fertility has increased over time. A century ago it took the United Kingdom 95 years and the US 82 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 to less than 3. This is a pattern that we see often in development: those countries that first experience social change take much longer for transitions than those who catch up later: Countries that were catching up increased <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> much faster, they reduced <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> more quickly and were able to grow their <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">incomes</a> much more rapidly.

The IIASA population projections are the most cited alternative to the UN work.

Interestingly their medium projection ‚Äì which they consider most likely ‚Äì stands in stark contrast to the UN projection. While the medium variant of the UN projection sees the world population growing continuously throughout the 21st century the IIASA medium (most likely) scenario see the world population increase to 9.4 billion in 2070 and then starts a slow decline to below 9 billion by the end of the century.

As the IIASA researchers <a href="https://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">explain</a> there are important methodological differences between the UN and IIASA projections. The UN uses probabilistic population projections to extrapolate populations for each country over the 21st century and is applying the same statistical methodology to all countries. The IIASA researchers in contrast have a country-specific approach that takes into account the knowledge of experts for each country separately.

The other important feature of the IIASA projection is that it takes into account the education of the population. As we show below in this data-entry there is a strong link between education and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">fertility</a> ‚Äì more educated women have fewer children. This link is taken into account in the model of the IIASA researchers and contributes to their projection of a much smaller total world population over the course of the 21st century.

The breakdown by education level is especially interesting: It shows that our world will be inhabited by more and more educated people. In the visualization below you see that in 1970 there were only around 700 million people in the world that had secondary or post-secondary education. By the end of this century the number of people with secondary or post-secondary education will have increased 10-fold and will reach 7 billion people!

<h3>An example:</h3>
For example¬†let's assume¬†you want to write about¬†fertility and on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">fertility</a> page¬†you find this map that you want to embed in your own article:

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
<h3>All you have to do to embed it in your article:</h3>
At the bottom right of the chart you click the little income and then chose the option <strong>¬†&lt;/&gt;Embed</strong>. You will see a¬†box popping up with the following bit of text:

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN" width="100%" height="600px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Now you just take this bit of html code and place it in¬†the text of your own article.

An iframe is used to display a website within another website (<em>w3schools</em> has¬†<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp">more info on iframes</a>.) Similar to when you embed a YouTube video in your article, your article now embeds an Our World In Data visualization.

<h3>Change the map focus, change the year:</h3>
We try to make the embed tool as useful as possible: For example, you can focus on Africa instead of World in the map above; and you can move the time slider to 2015 (you will get <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?region=Africa&amp;year=2015">this</a>). Now when you click on<strong> &lt;/&gt; Embed</strong> you get the following bit of code:

&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?region=Africa&amp;year=2015" width="100%" height="600px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

If you copy-paste this code your article will embed the¬†map with a focus on Africa and the fertility rate for 2015.

And the same works for the chart view.¬†Just switch to Chart in the¬†visualization above and¬†add the countries that you are interested in ‚Äì like <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=DEU+IRN">this</a>. When you click on<strong> &lt;/&gt; Embed</strong> you can now get the code to embed this line chart.

This post was originally published on August 3, 2016. It was updated on 26 May 2017.
Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how healthcare is financed</a></strong>.</div>

The graph below shows the relationship between what a country spends on health per person and life expectancy in that country between 1970 and 2015 for a number of rich countries.

The US stands out as an outlier: it <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">spends far more on health than any other country</a>, yet the life expectancy of the American population is not longer, but actually shorter than in other countries that spend far less.

If we look at the time trend for each country, we first notice that all countries have followed an upward trajectory‚Äîthe population lives increasingly long lives as health expenditure increases. But again, the US stands out by following a much flatter trajectory: gains in life expectancy from additional health spending in the U.S. are much smaller than in the other high-income countries, particularly since the mid-1980s.

This development has led to a large inequality between the US and other rich countries. In the US health spending per capita is often more than¬†three times higher than¬†in other rich countries, yet the populations of countries with much lower health spending than the US enjoy considerably longer lives. In the most extreme case, we see that Americans spend more than 5-times what Chileans spend, yet the population of Chile actually lives longer than Americans.

<p style="text-align: center;">[This graph and more information can be found in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">entry on how healthcare is financed</a>.]</p>

<h3>And it is not only life expectancy</h3>
There are several aspects that contribute to the US being such an extreme outlier. <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa022033#t=article" target="_blank">Studies find, for instance, </a> that administrative costs in the health sector are higher in the US than in other countries; they also point out that price comparisons among countries rely on adjustments which are not ideally suited for comparisons of health costs, and this might make comparisons more difficult. Sometimes, these analyses point out that violence rates in the US are higher than in other rich countries, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/homicides/">and this is true</a>). But while this could explain the difference in levels, it is not a likely explanation for the difference in trends. Over the period shown in the chart above, violence and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/homicides/#usa">homicides have fallen in the US more than in other rich countries</a>, and this should have led to a narrowing of the difference rather than the growing gap that we see.

One of the reasons for the underachievement of the US is the large inequality in health spending. Growing expenditure without insurance expansion has meant that healthcare expenditure has become highly concentrated‚Äîthe top 5% of spenders account for almost half of spending, and the top 1% account for almost 20%‚Äîabove and beyond the expected inequality in need. In our entry on how healthcare is financed <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#what-was-the-consequence-of-growing-expenditure-without-insurance-expansion-in-the-us">we discuss</a> the empirical data on this in more depth.

The higher levels of violence in the US (which kill mostly middle-aged Americans) also fail to explain why the US is not only a huge outlier in total life expectancy, but also in child mortality and maternal mortality. The share of children that die before their fifth birthday is much higher in the US than in other rich countries, even though the US spends much more on healthcare.
Maternal mortality is also much higher in the US than in many other rich countries, and while it is falling in most other countries it is increasing in the US.

The following visualization uses the data on <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">fertility</a> ‚Äì the number of children born per woman ‚Äì over time and combines it with information on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> over time. Taking these two time series together makes it possible to estimate how many children a woman on average lost before the children were five years old.
Below you see the data for Sweden which is one of the country for which we have the best historical data, the Swedish office for population statistics <em>Tabellverket</em> was founded as early as 1749.[ref]See the <a href="http://www.scb.se/en/About-us/main-activity/history-of-statistics-sweden/">history of Statistics in Sweden</a>.[/ref] The visualization shows that throughout most of the 19th century Swedish women gave birth to more than 4 children. As we have shown in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">Our World In Data-entry on child mortality</a>, in 19th century Sweden 1 out of 4 children died before its 5th birthday: This means that fertility and child mortality were so high that on average <em> every</em> woman lost 1 of her children before they could celebrate their 5th birthday.

With the decline of child mortality and fertility this became very rare. In 2015 Swedish women lost on average 0.006 children before they were 5 years old.

In this visualization you can change the country for which this time-series is visualized to explore the trends in countries around the world. To <em>compare</em> the number of children lost per woman for several countries ‚Äì and see the data on a world map ‚Äì you can use <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-died-before-five-per-woman">this visualisation</a>.

The data shown in this visualization is calculated based on the historical estimates of fertility and child mortality presented at <a href="http://gapminder.org">Gapminder.org</a> (see the sources tab in the chart for more information); particularly for the early period data coverage is not as good as one wishes and it should be understood that the presented estimates are coming with a considerable uncertainty.

The following visualisation shows global income inequality in 2003 and 2013.¬†The data shown here were carefully prepared by¬†Tomas Hellebrandt and Paolo Mauro from the Bank of England and the IMF.[ref]Hellebrandt, Tomas and Mauro, Paolo (2015) ‚Äì The Future of Worldwide Income Distribution (April 1, 2015).

You see the yearly disposable income for all world citizens in both 2003 and 2013. On the x-axis you see the¬†position of an individual¬†in the global distribution of incomes and on the logarithmic y-axis you see the annual disposable income at that position.

The increase in prosperity ‚Äì and decrease of poverty ‚Äì is substantial. The income cut-off of the poorest 10% has increased from 260 international-$ to 480 international-% and the median income has almost doubled from 1,100 international-$ to 2,010. Global mean income¬†in 2013 is 5,375 international-$.[ref]Note that global GDP per capita¬†in 2013 was around 14,000 international-$ and substantially higher than¬†mean disposable income from household-level surveys at¬†5,375 international-$.

We discuss the reasons for this discrepancy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth#discrepancy-between-incomes-reported-in-household-surveys-and-gdp-per-capita">here</a>. See also the Appendix of the original publication for a longer explanation.[/ref]

The share of the world population <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/">living in¬†extreme poverty fell from 25% (in 2002) to 11% in 2013</a>.

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Global income inequality is still very high and will¬†stay very high for a long time</h4>
The visualisation below presents the same data in the same way except that the y-axis is now not logarithmic but linear. In this perspective the still very high level of global inequality is shown even more clearly.

The previous and the following¬†visualisation show how very high global income inequality still is: The¬†cut-off to the richest 10% of the world in 2013¬†was 14,500 int-$; the cut-off for the poorest 10% was 480 int-$. The ratio is 30.2.

While¬†global inequality is still very high we are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-economic-inequality">now living in a period of falling global inequality</a>: In 2003¬†this ratio was 37.6. The Gini coefficient has also fallen from 68.7 to 64.9 over the ten year period.

Taking the historical experience as a guide for what is possible in the future we have to conclude that global inequality will remain high for a¬†long time. To see this we can ask how long it will take for those with incomes at the poorest 10% cutoff to achieve the current incomes of the richest 10% cutoff which is 14,500 international-$. This income level is¬†roughly the¬†level of GDP per capita¬†above which the¬†poverty headcount gets close to 0% for most countries (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/#poverty-reduction-and-economic-growth">see here</a>).

<strong>How long does it take for incomes to grow from 480$ to 14,500$?</strong>

Even under a very optimistic scenario it will take several decades for the poor to¬†reach the income level of the global top 10%.

2% is roughly the growth rate that the richest countries of today experienced over the last decades (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth#economic-growth-at-the-technological-frontier-growth-in-the-usa">see here</a>).¬†We have seen that poorer countries can achieve faster growth, but we have not seen growth rates of¬†more than¬†6% over a time frame as long as necessary to reach the level of the global 10%¬†in such a short time. If the past is a good guide for the future the world will very likely be highly unequal for a long time.

Yet there are many daily, recurring tragedies in the world which create as much or more suffering and often go unnoticed.

The <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)</a>¬†estimates that in¬†1990¬†more than¬†12 million children died. Most of these deaths were preventable, and arose from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/#child-mortality-by-cause-of-death">illness and poverty</a>.

Let's put this in perspective. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents">Aviation disasters</a> are a form of tragedy that is both relatively uncommon and widely reported. A Boeing 747¬†can carry up to 620 people.[ref]The exact number of seats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747">depends</a> on the seating configuration and while 524 seats are typical, 620 is on the high end.[/ref] The¬†total number of child deaths in 1990 is equivalent to 53¬†massive aircraft disasters every day, involving primarily children, with no survivors.

While every plane crash makes the headlines and 53 of them in a single day would have media coverage everywhere, we¬†see proportionally less reporting about the more prevalent causes of mortality. By considering how the unseen, daily cruelty¬†of child death compares to discrete tragic events, we can find a sense of perspective about the scale involved.

Here at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">OurWorldInData.org</a> we present the empirical evidence of global development. To understand these issues and see the progress involved, we need to have a look at long-term changes over the course of history.

<h2>A ten-fold decrease in child mortality</h2>

The below chart shows the share of¬†children¬†surviving the first five years of their lives. It goes back to the year 1800. Health conditions in the time of our ancestors were such that more than 4 out of 10 newborns died before their fifth¬†birthday.¬†The historical estimates further suggest that it was the entire world that lived in poor conditions: there was relatively little variation between world regions, and even in the best-off countries of 1800 every third child perished.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-child-mortality-timeseries" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Children regularly dying was a reality for all families for a very long time. For millennia our ancestors lived in poor health and most <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/#child-mortality-in-pre-modern-cultures">had short lives</a>.

The chart shows that this finally began to improve in the 20th century, as humanity achieved broad improvements in health and living conditions. In the first half of the 1900s, the global child mortality rate fell by more than half and yet was still high: every fifth child born in 1960 died before 1965. Fortunately, in recent decades ‚Äì in our lifetimes ‚Äì we have seen rapid progress. In 2015 global child mortality¬†fell to 4.3% ‚Äì 10-fold lower than two centuries ago.

One reason we do not see this progress is that we are unaware of how much worse the past was.¬†A long-term perspective is crucial.

<h2>Child mortality declined in all countries</h2>

The decline in global child mortality is not just due to improvements in a¬†few well-off, developed regions. In fact, <em>every single country</em> achieved a reduction. This is what the chart below shows. Hover over the lines with your mouse to see the decline of child mortality in¬†each country.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-by-country" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Yet, even after decades of unprecedented global progress there are still stark divides. The difference between the worst-off countries (e.g. Angola with a 16% child mortality) and the best-off countries (e.g. Luxembourg at 0.2%), shows what is possible and underscores that a lot of work remains to be done.

This work is already underway. The biggest recent improvements were¬†achieved in the countries that were worst off in the 1950s. The least healthy¬†countries have been catching up, and the inequality in health across the world today¬†is substantially lower than a few¬†decades ago.

With fewer children dying, we might initially expect populations to increase, leading to problems with living space and resource consumption. Thankfully, in the long term this does not appear to be the case: as countries develop and mortality falls, they also undergo a decrease in birth rates known as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/#demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>. This trend is expected to continue to apply to those developing countries which currently have both high mortality and high birth rates. We recently made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348">short video</a> about this with our colleagues at¬†Kurzgesagt.

<h2>We are making progress against a broad range of¬†causes of child death</h2>

What is killing our¬†children? Here we¬†compare the causes of child death in 1990¬†and in 2015. The data comes¬†from¬†the IHME's <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">Global Burden of Disease study</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-child-mortality-by-cause" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

This visualization shows the many causes of child deaths and the mortality rate that they are responsible for. Birth complications, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and malaria all still lead to the death of more than 400,000¬†children annually.

In many cases, the comparison with 1990¬†shows that we are on track to a rapid reduction. But the¬†breakdown by cause also highlights that preventable diseases are still responsible for an¬†unacceptably¬†large share of child deaths and we have the¬†duty and the possibility to reduce child mortality further.

<h2>27 major plane crashes averted every day</h2>

The achievement that this blog post¬†highlights is that child mortality has decreased substantially. What does this mean in terms of the absolute number of child deaths that we discussed above?

The number of child deaths declined from over 12 million in 1990 to 5.8 million in 2015 (the year for which we have the latest data).¬†Notably, this decline by 6.3¬†million child deaths happened despite the absolute number of births increasing slightly over the same period.

6.3 million fewer deaths means that¬†compared with 1990, there are 17,258 fewer child deaths¬†<em>every single day</em>.

We¬†were also surprised to see the scale of the¬†reduction of child mortality when broken down like this. Over a period of 25 years, in which the number of births had slightly increased, the world was able to reduce the number of child deaths every single day by more than 17,000. Compared with 1990, this¬†is the equivalent of saving 27 planes from crashing on a daily basis. Were it to receive as much attention as aviation disasters do, we think this would be seen as an extremely big deal.

Every case of a family losing a child is a tragedy.¬†And¬†even after an impressive improvement in global health,¬†the unseen daily cruelty of child death remains immense: close to 6 million children still die every year; 16,000 children every day.

The enormous global tragedy of preventable child death, and the progress against it, are best seen over time scales too long for a standard media cycle. We should still strive to be aware of both. The number of deaths remains very high, but the historical perspective gives us hope that a future where many more children are able to live full lives is possible.";s:10:"post_title";s:122:"Global child mortality: it is hard to overestimate both the immensity of the tragedy, and¬†the progress the world has made";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:119:"global-child-mortality-it-is-hard-to-overestimate-both-the-immensity-of-the-tragedy-and-the-progress-the-world-has-made";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-02-14 20:22:09";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-02-14 20:22:09";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=10179";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"10268";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-03-07 15:43:11";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-03-07 15:43:11";s:12:"post_content";s:5035:"<hr />

Extreme poverty is defined as¬†living with less than 1.90 international dollars per day. International dollars (int.-$) are inflation-adjusted and corrected for price differences between countries, which is what makes them 'international'.

The share of the world population living in extreme poverty has fallen <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#200-years-of-lifting-the-world-out-of-poverty">very substantially</a> in the last 200 years: from over 80% in 1820 to 10% in the latest estimates. In recent decades, extreme poverty has declined faster than ever before in human history.

Often when¬†I point this out ‚Äì in conversation or on social media ‚Äì I hear the response 'Yes, but this is only because of China.'

This post asks whether this statement is true. Is¬†the substantial decline of global¬†poverty only due to the poverty decline in China?

<h3>The historical decline of extreme poverty in China</h3>
First, let us look at the historical evolution of extreme poverty in China. The following chart shows the declining share of the Chinese population living below the International Poverty Line (1.90 int.-$), according to World Bank estimates.

In 1981 around 88% of the Chinese population lived in extreme poverty (i.e. below the International Poverty Line). According to the latest estimates,¬†extreme poverty ‚Äì measured in the same way ‚Äì has declined to 2% in China.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-population-living-in-extreme-poverty?country=CHN" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h3>Comparing a world with and without China</h3>
The decline from almost every Chinese person living in extreme poverty to almost no Chinese people¬†living in extreme poverty is of course an exceptional achievement. But is this the entire story of falling global poverty?

To see whether it was China alone that was responsible for this decline in extreme poverty, we recalculated the share of people living in extreme poverty and disregarded China entirely. This allows us to¬†compare a planet with China to a planet without China.¬†(At the end of the post it is explained how¬†poverty for the non-Chinese world population was calculated.)

The chart below shows the results. In blue is the decline of global poverty, in red the decline of poverty excluding China.

We see that the reduction of global poverty was¬†very substantial even when we do not take into account the poverty reduction in China. In 1981 almost one third (29%) of the non-Chinese world population was living in extreme poverty. By 2013 this share had fallen to 12%.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/poverty-decline-without-china" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

What is also interesting to see in the chart¬†is that until 2005, the inclusion of China increased the share of the world population living in extreme poverty; but since then,¬†this has reversed, and the inclusion of China is now reducing the global poverty headcount ratio. This is because 2005 is the year when China's poverty fell below the world poverty ratio.

As a side note,¬†it is of course silly anyway to say 'the decline of global poverty is <em>only</em> because of China'.¬†We care about people - not about countries, and since more than every 5th person in the world is Chinese, it is a really¬†important achievement for the world that extreme poverty has¬†decreased so substantially in China.

Still, the decline of¬†global extreme poverty is even more than that. Extreme poverty declined in China <em>and</em> in the rest of the world.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>Explanation of how poverty for the world without China was calculated:</strong>
In 1981 there were 4.5 billion people in the world. 42% of these were extremely poor.
So there were 1.9 billion extremely poor people and 2.6 billion people not in extreme poverty.

In the same year ‚Äì 1981 ‚Äì the population of China was 1 billion. Of these 1 billion Chinese 88% were living in extreme poverty. This means that out of all the 1.9 billion extreme poor 0.88 billion were Chinese. Almost half. There were 1.02 billion extreme poor non-Chinese in the world

The world population without China in 1981 was 3.5 billion; and of these there were 1.02 billion extreme poor. This is 29%, as shown in the chart.</em>";s:10:"post_title";s:60:"The global decline of extreme poverty ‚Äì was it only China?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:55:"the-global-decline-of-extreme-poverty-was-it-only-china";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-03-08 14:40:52";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-03-08 14:40:52";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=10268";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:13;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"10838";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"2";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-03-26 14:02:44";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-03-26 14:02:44";s:12:"post_content";s:3419:"In our team, we are currently trying to find¬†a new design and structure for Our World in Data¬†that makes our work more useful to readers. Some¬†entries are getting very long (e.g. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">financing of healthcare</a>¬†or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education">global education</a>) and¬†we think it should be possible to find a format that works better for the reader.

Usually, we discuss¬†things like this internally but in this case, I thought I would share our challenge here. We don't have a designer on our team and I'm hoping that there is a small chance that someone who reads this might understand how to find a good format and can give us some hints.

<strong>Design</strong>

What do the designers¬†out there think about the look of Our World In Data? What needs to be changed? Fonts? Logos? Colors?

<strong>Structure</strong>

Each of our entries is dedicated to a specific aspect of global living conditions ‚Äì poverty, child mortality, etc. They have a standardized format and are structured into¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/about/#the-data-entries">4 sections</a>.¬†What we are looking for¬†is a format that works for all entries and makes sense for our content and 4-section structure.

The new structure¬†should make it easier for the reader to read¬†the text and the visuals. Especially for those readers who are not reading the entire entry (the majority of readers), it should be as easy as possible to find the¬†bit of the entry that they are interested in.

Our current idea is that the "Empirical View" (section 1) section stays as it is. The¬†following "Correlates, determinants and consequences" section we¬†want to change in our current draft. The section¬†should¬†not¬†be shown by default¬†and instead we want to use a mix of (1) <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp">accordions</a> that open sections within the document and (2) links to shorter pages that open in a new tab and that have the format of our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/blog/">blog posts</a>.

The first reason for¬†the new structure of the correlates section is to make the entries shorter. The second reason is that linking to outside documents makes sense for our website since¬†a text on the link between AIDS and poverty for example can then be linked to from both the entry on AIDS and the entry on poverty.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/" target="_blank">Global Extreme Poverty</a></strong>.</div>

People are considered to live in extreme poverty if they live below the International Poverty Line. This line is set by the World Bank and corresponds to 1.90 international-dollars (int.-$) per person per day. By any standard this is an extremely low poverty line ‚Äì the term "extreme poverty" is appropriate.

We have just¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/">completely updated our entry on extreme poverty</a>, where we discuss the global picture, and how poverty is measured.

In the entry on extreme poverty we emphasize that the share of people living in extreme poverty has declined <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#the-share-of-people-in-poverty-over-the-past-two-centuries">continuously for two centuries</a>; and it has never declined faster than in recent years.¬†

This long decline is one of the greatest achievements of humanity and I think it is the most important global development in our lifetime.

<strong>Are poverty rates <em>really</em> going down?</strong>

A claim that often comes up in discussions of extreme poverty is that¬†the share of people in extreme poverty is declining only because¬†international institutions¬†deliberately choose a poverty line that is much too low. It is suggested then that "true poverty" in the world is actually increasing.

This allegation is unfounded. The following visualization of the global income distribution in 2003 and 2013 shows why. 

To read this chart, choose¬†a level of annual income on the y-axis (you can call this the true global poverty line); and then use the blue and red lines to find on the x-axis the corresponding share of the world population living with less than that income (the blue line gives the value in 2013, the red line in 2003).¬†

If you think the poverty line should be higher than the International Poverty Line, and it should instead be 1,000 int.-$ per year, you can see that in 2003, 48% of the world population¬†was below this poverty line; and ten years later, in 2013, 29% was below this line. A decline of 20 percentage points in one decade relative to this higher poverty line!

If you think the international poverty line should be much higher and should indeed be 4,000¬†int.-$, then you see that in 2003, 80% of the world population was below that poverty line. 10 years later: 67%. A decline of 13 percentage points!

The message from this chart is clear: No matter what global poverty line you choose, the share of people below that poverty line has declined.

The study by Mauro and Hellebrandt[ref]Hellebrandt, Tomas and Mauro, Paolo (2015) ‚Äì The Future of Worldwide Income Distribution (April 1, 2015). Peterson Institute for International Economics Working Paper No. 15-7. Available at <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593894">SSRN</a> or <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2593894">http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2593894</a>.[/ref] on which the above chart is based only has data from 2003 onwards.¬†But¬†there is some good data that allows going back further in time, as well as looking at absolute numbers of people in poverty (rather than shares).

The visualization below shows a breakdown of the population by per capita household consumption. As explained in the note underneath the chart it only includes non-rich countries, as the income of the large majority of people in¬†rich¬†countries <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-rich-countries-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-know/">is much higher</a> and not included in this data source.

The chart shows the population relative to different poverty lines for more than 3 decades:
<ul>
 	<li>Globally the share living with less than 1.25 int.-$ per day is declining.</li>
 	<li>Globally the share living with less than 1.90 int.-$ per day is declining.</li>
 	<li>Globally the share living with less than 3.10¬†int.-$ per day is declining.</li>
 	<li>Globally the share living with less than 10¬†int.-$ per day is declining.</li>
</ul>

These numbers show that an income of 10 int.-$ per day ‚Äì or 3,650 int.-$ per year ‚Äì cannot be¬†considered a reasonable cutoff for <em>extreme</em> poverty, since 65% of the world population has an income of less than this (this is clear from the previous chart).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-in-non-rich-countries-by-per-capita-household-income?stackMode=relative" width="300" height="150"></iframe>


<strong>Rates are going down ‚Äì what about the <em>total</em> number of people in poverty?</strong>

Now let's change the question and think about the absolute number of people below a certain poverty line: How is the number of people¬†below these higher global poverty lines changing?

The chart below gives the answer, again looking only at the people¬†in non-rich countries (currently more than 6 billion people):

<ul>
 	<li>Globally, the¬†number of people with less than 1.25 int.-$ per day is¬†declining.</li>
 	<li>Globally, the¬†number of people with less than 1.90 int.-$ per day is¬†declining.</li>
 	<li>Globally, the¬†number of people with less than 3.10¬†int.-$ per day is¬†declining.</li>
<ul>
 	<li>(If you are interested to see this country by country¬†we have included a chart in the poverty entry that shows the share living with less than¬†3.10 int.-$ per day¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#the-share-of-people-below-a-higher-poverty-line-of-3-10-int">here</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Notice that during¬†recent¬†years, even the¬†number of people with less than 10 int.-$ per day is not increasing; in fact, since around 2005 it has actually declined slightly.

Even at the very low cutoff of 1.90 int.-$ per day there are still around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#the-demographics-of-extreme-poverty" target="_blank">750 million people living in extreme poverty today</a>. There is absolutely no reason to be complacent about poverty today, but we should be very clear: the share of the population living in extreme poverty is indeed falling. 

I think it is important to know what the most important developments in the world are, and we should study them to learn how to further increase prosperity ‚Äì and one day eradicate extreme poverty globally.

As the focus is on international comparisons I have made sure to list all the metrics and datasets that are included in the World Bank's extensive <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats">EdStats</a> data catalogue. With all the many measures on attainment and enrollment, in gross and net rates, ISCED levels, etc. etc. it can be difficult to understand what education data actually refers to. I hope this document is useful as a reference for some.

<h3>General</h3>
A general difficulty in educational data is to find a good measure to express the share of children that are taken into, enrolled, or attending educational institutions. The difficulty here is that several options for the considered age-bracket of children are possible as both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio ‚Äì each possibility comes with difficulties and advantages. The main difference here is to distinguish between <strong>the¬†gross and the net rate:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Gross rates</strong> take into account all children at a given level of education regardless of their age and relate these to the population of the age group which officially corresponds to that level of education.
<ul>
 	<li>The advantage is that the numerator includes all children at the particular level of education. The downside is that there cannot be a corresponding denominator. One option would be to express it relative to the entire population (which is sometimes done for tertiary education), but an often more informative ‚Äì albeit not perfect option ‚Äì is to express it relative to the population in the official age-bracket for that level of education.¬†For this reason gross rates can exceed 100%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Net rates</strong> only take into account those children who are in the official age group for a given level of education in both the numerator and denominator.
<ul>
 	<li>The advantage of net rates is that children within the same age bracket are compared and it is therefore not possible that the net rate exceeds 100%. The disadvantage is that not all children in a particular level of education are considered in net rates ‚Äì those that are older or younger than the official age group are not considered in this measure.</li>

The intake of students into the educational system can be measured as the absolute number of students (for example by a measure such as "New entrants to grade 1 in primary (in absolute numbers)"). However to compare intake across countries and over time intake <em>rates</em> are more informative. Several intake rates are commonly used:
<h4>Intake rate</h4>
The<strong> net intake ratio to grade 1 of primary education</strong> =¬†total number of new entrants in Grade 1 of primary education who are of the official primary school-entrance age / the population of the same age.

The <strong>gross intake ratio to grade 1 of primary education</strong> =¬†total number of new entrants in Grade 1 of primary education, regardless of their age / the population at the official primary school entrance age.

</ul>
The¬†<strong>expected gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education</strong> =¬†total number of new entrants to the first grade of primary in a given year, regardless of age, who are expected to reach the last grade of primary education, regardless of repetition / the population at the official entrance age to primary education in the same year.

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Enrollment</h3>
Enrollment figures, by level of education, are published in absolute numbers, but for comparisons between countries and over time enrollment <em>rates</em> are again more commonly used.

The difference between the various enrollment rates listed above are which age groups are measured in the numerator and denominator of the ratio. There are are additional measures that specifically look at the enrollment of over-age and under-age children such as the: "over-age enrollment ratio in primary education" or the "percentage of students enrolled in primary education who are over-age" (and the same metrics are published for "under-age" children).
<h4>Enrollment rate</h4>
Enrollment rates ‚Äì also "enrollment ratios" ‚Äì are available not only by level of education (primary, secondary, tertiary), but also be grade (grade 1 of primary, grade 2 of primary, etc.). They are often disaggregated by sex and socioeconomic background of the parents.

The<strong> net enrollment¬†rate =</strong>¬†students enrolled who are of the official age group for a given level of education / the population for the same age group.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/net-enrolment-rate">Net enrollment rate definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
The<strong> gross enrollment¬†rate = </strong>number of¬†students enrolled in a given level of education (regardless of their age) / the population of the age group which officially corresponds to the given level of education.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/gross-enrolment-ratio">Gross enrollment rate definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
 	<li>Since the numerator and denominator are referring to the population in different age groups it is possible that the gross enrollment rate exceeds 100%.</li>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Attendance</h3>
Attendance rates are available by level of education (primary, secondary, tertiary or more levels of detail), by sex, rural-vs-urban location, and parental socioeconomic background.

The <strong>net attendance rate</strong> = total number of students in the theoretical age group for a given level of education attending that level at any time during the reference academic year / total population in that age group.

&nbsp;
<h3>Out-of-school</h3>
Data on the <strong>number of out-of-school</strong> <strong>children</strong> (primary school age) and <strong>out-of-school</strong> <strong>adolescents</strong> (secondary school age) are published. For comparisons drop-out <em>rates</em> are often more informative.

The data on¬†out-of-school children (of primary school age) and of adolescents (of secondary school age) is also broken down by <strong>"typology" of out-of-school children</strong> to differentiate between those who never attended school, those who dropped out, and those who are currently out of school, but are expected to enter the education system later than they should ("late entry").

&nbsp;
<h3>Drop-out</h3>
The <strong>drop-out-rate (by grade)</strong> is the share of¬†pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who are no longer enrolled in the following school year.
<ul>
 	<li>It is the share of children who are neither promoted to the next grade nor have to repeat the same grade again and it is therefore calculated as follows: <strong>drop-out-rate</strong> = 100% ‚Äì (promotion rate + repetition rate)</li>
 	<li><strong>Drop-out-rates</strong>¬†are published for different levels of education as cumulative drop-out-rates and also for specific grades within a particular level of education.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/dropout-rate-grade">Drop-out-rate by grade definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Promotion</h3>
Promotion refers to the progression from one <em>grade</em> to the next while transition refers to the promotion from one <em>level</em> of education to the next (primary to secondary or secondary to tertiary).

The <strong>promotion rate (by grade)</strong> =¬†number of new enrollment in a given grade in the following school year / number of students from the same cohort enrolled in the preceding grade in the previous school year
<ul>
 	<li>The promotion rate measures the share¬†of students from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who study in the next grade in the following school year.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/promotion-rate-grade">The promotion rate by grade definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
The¬†<strong>effective promotion rate (by grade)</strong> =¬†number of new entrants to the following grade for the following year / number of students enrolled in the previous grade in the given year without the number of repeaters at that previous grade in that following year.

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Transition</h3>
Transition rates are published for transitions between different levels of education (primary to secondary, secondary to tertiary).

The <strong>transition rate</strong> = number of students admitted to the first grade of the next higher level of education in a given year / number of students enrolled in the final grade of the lower level of education in the previous year.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/transition-rate">The transition rate definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
The <strong>effective transition rate</strong> =¬†number of new entrants to the first grade of the higher level of education in the following year / students enrolled in the last grade of the given level of education in the given year who do not repeat that grade the following year

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Survival</h3>
Survival rates are published for example as the¬†'survival rate to the last grade of primary education' or as the 'survival rate to grade 4 of primary education'.

The <strong>survival rate</strong> (to a particular grade at a specific level of education) =¬†total number of students belonging to a school-cohort who reached each successive grade of the specified level of education / the number of students in the school-cohort (i.e. those originally enrolled in the first grade of the specified level of education)
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/survival-rate-grade">The survival rate by grade definition by the UNESCO</a>.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Repeating</h3>
A repeater is a student who¬†is enrolled in the same grade for more than one year.¬†Data on repeaters is also available in absolute numbers , broken down by sex, and by specific grade in the education system (grade 1 in primary education, grade 2 in primary education, etc.).

The <strong>repetition rate</strong>¬†(by grade) =¬†number of repeaters in a given grade in the following school year / the number of pupils from the same cohort enrolled in the same grade in the previous school year
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/repetition-rate-grade">The repetition by grade definition of the UNESCO</a>.</li>
 	<li>Also calculated is the<strong> percentage of repeaters at a specific level of education</strong>. For example the percentage of repeaters at primary school level is the total number of students in primary school enrolled in the same grade as in the previous year, expressed as a percentage of all students enrolled in primary school.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>School life expectancy</h3>
The school life expectancy (SLE) is the number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend at a specific level of education (such as primary, secondary, and tertiary).

The World Bank explains: "For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates."

Regarding the interpretation the World Bank explains: "A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school. Those children who are in school may benefit from many more years of education than the average."

&nbsp;
<h3>Completion</h3>
Completion rates are published by level of education (primary, secondary, tertiary).

There are slightly different definitions of the <strong>completion rate</strong> used by different organizations. The UNESCO <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/completion-rate">defines</a> the completion rate as follows: "Percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade. The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age at which pupils would enter the grade if they had started school at the official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed without repeating or skipping a grade."

Other organizations however publish completion rates regardless of the children's age relative to the intended age.

The completion rate can exceed 100% due to repeaters and over- and under-aged children who enter the specific level of school late or early.

The¬†<strong>cohort completion rate</strong> for a specific level of education =¬†survival rate to the last grade of primary education * (number of graduates from the specific level of education in a given year / difference between enrolment in the last grade in the same year and repeaters in the last grade in the following year)
<ul>

</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Graduation</h3>
The <strong>gross graduation ratio</strong> =¬†number of graduates regardless of age in a given level or programme / population at the theoretical graduation age for that level or programme

&nbsp;
<h2>Educational attainment</h2>
In contrast to the previous metrics, educational attainment metrics are used to measure the level of education across the population older than the population that is still in the educational system.

Attainment is often further broken down by sex, age group, and also nationality, race, socioeconomic status, and also socioeconomic background of the parents.
<h4>Mean Years of Schooling</h4>
Mean years of schooling are the average number of completed years of education of a country's population. Grades that were repeated are mostly excluded.

The measure commonly refers to the population older than 15 or 25 years. The younger population is excluded because a large fraction of these is often still attending educational institutions at that age.

Mean years of schooling is often additionally disaggregated by mean years of schooling by type of schooling (primary, secondary, and tertiary).

Data on mean years of schooling is published in several sources:
<ul>
 	<li>Clio-Infra publishes estimates for countries around the world from the year 1860 to 2010.</li>
 	<li>IIASA-WC publishes projections until the year 2100. [available via the World Bank's EdStats.]</li>
 	<li>Barro &amp; Lee publish data from .¬†[available via the World Bank's EdStats.]</li>
 	<li>UNESCO Institute for Statistics ("UIS").¬†[available via the World Bank's EdStats.]</li>
</ul>
<h4>Population by highest level of education</h4>
A second way to measure the educational attainment is to focus on the highest level of education a particular individual attended. It is either expressed as the the absolute number or the share of the population with a particular level of education.

Data sources: Available from IIASA-WC, Barrro &amp; Lee, and UNESCO Institute for Statistics ("UIS").

<h2>Levels of education</h2>
The broad categories of primary, secondary, and tertiary education apply in most countries, but the specifics are very different from country to country. Because educational systems differ substantially between countries it is difficult to compare the level of educational attainment between different countries. This is why it became necessary to harmonize the levels of education in a standardized system that can be applied to every country. To make education statistics comparable across countries, the UNESCO designed the <strong><em>International Standard Classification of Education</em> (ISCED)¬†</strong>shown in the table below.

The UNESCO published the ISCED classification information in <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf">this document</a>. The ISCED mappings for each country are <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/isced-mappings">published here</a>.
<h6>The 8 levels of the¬†International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)[ref]This table is taken from the Wikipedia entry on ISCED <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Education">here</a>.

<h3>Measures specific to early childhood education</h3>
New entrants to Grade 1 of primary education with early childhood education experience.

&nbsp;
<h3>Measures specific to secondary education</h3>
The <em>UNESCO Institute for Statistics</em> differentiates between <strong>vocational and general education</strong> on the secondary level of education.

<strong>Vocational education</strong> is described as follow: <em>"Vocational education is designed for learners to acquire the knowledge, skills and competencies specific to a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades. Vocational education may have work-based components (e.g. apprenticeships). Successful completion of such programmes leads to labour-market relevant vocational qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labour market."</em>

<strong>General education</strong> at the secondary school level is described as: <em>"General education is designed to develop learners‚Äô general knowledge, skills and competencies and literacy and numeracy skills, often to prepare students for more advanced educational programmes at the same or higher ISCED levels and to lay the foundation for lifelong learning. General educational programmes are typically school- or college-based. General education includes educational programmes that are designed to prepare students for entry into vocational education, but that do not prepare for employment in a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades, nor lead directly to a labour market relevant qualification."</em>

Level 4 on the ISCED classification is referred to as <strong>"post-secondary non-tertiary education"</strong>. According to the <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf">UNESCO classification</a>, education at this level "provides learning experiences building on secondary education, preparing for labour market entry as well as tertiary education", but the content of such a program "is not sufficiently complex to be regarded as tertiary education, although it is clearly post-secondary".
<h3>Measures specific to tertiary education</h3>
Because the age group of students in tertiary education varies more than for primary or secondary education it is common to publish the ratio of students enrolled in tertiary education relative to the entire population, for example the <strong>ratio between students in tertiary education¬†per 100,000 inhabitants</strong>.

Instead of statistics on particular grades it is common in international educational statistics on tertiary education to refer to the ISCED levels 5, 6, and 7.

Because of the specialization of education at this level it is common to publish statistics on particular specializations. These are standardized by the UNESCO across countries in the¬†International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)¬†fields of tertiary education. The following table shows this classification which comprises 25 narrow fields of education which fall into 9 broader groups.
<h6>The classification of fields of tertiary education according to the UNESCO's <em>International Standard Classification of Education</em> (ISCED)[ref]This table is taken from the¬†OECD publication "Education Indicators in Focus" (February 2014) online <a href="https://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/EDIF%202014--No19.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]</h6>

<h2>Measures on Learning Outcomes</h2>
All data discussed is concerned with inputs in the education system ‚Äì ultimately it is about how much time students spend in educational institutions. For educational inputs we have pretty complete data coverage, both, in time and space. But the goal of going to school is of course to learn and on this aspect ‚Äì the learning outcomes of education ‚Äì data is much sparser. Efforts to measure these outcomes are geographically more restricted (often only OECD countries are included) and even less is known about how the performance of students with respect to these outcomes has changed over time. A third limitation is that measures are sometimes not comparable between countries. 

Most often these assessment are measuring learning outcomes of one or several of the following three dimensions:
<ul>
 	<li>Reading and language proficiency</li>
 	<li>Mathematics and numeracy proficiency</li>
 	<li>Scientific knowledge and understanding</li>
</ul>
Scores are published broken down by sex and sometimes by socioeconomic background.

The assessments differ in respect to how children are selected. While some assessments select children by their age, there are other assessments which select children by the school grade the child attends. The aim of these studies is to test¬†a representative random sample of the intended population.

The most widely available metric on the outcomes of education is literacy. The data on this very basic educational skill is briefly discussed below and in much more detail in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/">our entry on the topic</a>.

A detailed discussion of the assessment of learning outcomes is provided by Daniel Koretz in his book¬†<em>Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us.</em>[ref]Daniel¬†Koretz (2008) ‚Äì <em>Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us</em>. Harvard University Press. <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035218&amp;content=reviews">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674035218&amp;content=reviews</a>[/ref]
<h4>PISA ‚Äì¬†The Programme for International Student Assessment</h4>
&nbsp;

The PISA assessment, which is coordinated by the OECD, is the most well known international assessment of learning outcomes. The first PISA study was carried out in 1997 and since then it was repeated every three years.

The study is not select students by grade, but by age and only tests 15-year-olds, whatever their school level. In a two-hour assessment the competencies in reading, mathematics and science of these students are assessed. It is a very substantial undertaking and until 2017 "half a million students representing 28 million 15-year-olds in 72 countries and economies have participated in PISA" <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/">according to the OECD</a>. The coverage of PISA can be seen in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pisa-test-score-mean-performance-on-the-reading-scale">this map</a> on the results in the reading dimension, it obviously includes the richer OECD countries and unfortunately only few poorer countries. Poorer countries are also not tested regularly and were only participating in one round only and additionally it can be the case that for poorer countries not students from the entire country were selected, but instead only from particular regions.

PISA, as well as TIMSS, are standardizing their results so that the average score of students from OECD countries is 500 and the student standard deviation is 100. Assuming a normal distribution of measurement outcomes this means 68% of OECD students are reaching scores in the range between 400 and 600.

While TIMSS focuses on content that is covered in the school curriculum PISA aims to "assesses the application of skills to real-life problems" and¬†"emphasizes the importance of the context in which students should be able to use their skills (schools, home and society)".

PISA tests the students in three different dimensions, which they define as follows:[ref]Cited from PISA 2015 Results (Volume II) <em>Policies and Practices for Successful Schools</em>. Online <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/9816071e.pdf?expires=1507658106&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=B97B1B4F48D8D618D0E03486C41BB787">here</a>.[/ref]
<ul>
 	<li><em>"<strong>Science literacy</strong> is defined as the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen. A scientifically literate person is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science and technology, which requires the competencies to explain phenomena scientifically, evaluate and design scientific enquiry, and interpret data and evidence scientifically.</em></li>
 	<li><em><strong>Reading literacy</strong> is defined as students‚Äô ability to understand, use, reflect on and engage with written texts in order to achieve one‚Äôs goals, develop one‚Äôs knowledge and potential, and participate in society.</em></li>
 	<li><em><strong>Mathematical literacy</strong> is defined as students‚Äô capacity to formulate, employ and interpret mathematics in a variety of contexts. It includes reasoning mathematically and using mathematical concepts, procedures, facts and tools to describe, explain and predict phenomena. It assists individuals in recognising the role that mathematics plays in the world and to make the well-founded judgements and decisions needed by constructive, engaged and reflective citizens."</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Cross country comparability of the PISA results</strong>

When the PISA study includes non-OECD countries it is often the case that students are not selected from the entire country, but instead only from selected regions within that country.¬†Results reported for China ‚Äì <a href="http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/embed/map?lg=en">and labelled as such by the OECD</a> ‚Äì in fact are only based on four Chinese provinces: Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong. These regions are not representative of China as a whole and there is every reason to expect that students from these provinces have access to better education than the average Chinese 15-year-olds. The four regions are among the very richest regions of China and incomes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_administrative_divisions_by_GDP_per_capita">up to twice that of the national Chines average</a>.

Similarly when PISA reported on "India" in 2009 the assessments were made in two states of India only (Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).
<h4>TIMSS ‚Äì Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study</h4>
As the name says, TIMSS is an assessment of the¬†mathematics and science knowledge of students. As the closely linked PIRLS¬†it is carried out by the <em>International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement</em> (IEA).

While PISA selects the assessed students by age and focusses on 15-year olds, TIMMS selects students by the grade they attend and tests students in Grades 4, 8, and in their final year.

TIMSS started slightly earlier than PISA. The first TIMSS was conducted in 1995 and¬†covered 45 national educational systems. Later rounds included more countries ‚Äì the 2011 round included 77 countries/area. The coverage of TIMSS is similar to PISA and includes mostly richer countries which are part of the OECD and only few poorer countries.¬†The coverage of TIMSS can be seen in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-score-for-4th-graders-on-the-timss-science-assessment">this map</a> on the results in the science dimension.

Precursors to TIMSS were already conducted from 1964 onwards.
<h4>PIRLS ‚Äì¬†Progress in International Reading Literacy Study</h4>
The PIRLS is the other major study carried out by the IEA. Here¬†the objective is to assess primary school students in reading proficiency. PIRLS only started in 2001.



<h4>LLECE ‚Äì¬†Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education</h4>
LLECE is an assessment carried out only in <strong>Latin American</strong> countries. This map shows the¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/llece-mean-performance-on-the-mathematics-scale-for-6th-grade-students">mathematics score of 6th graders</a>.

<h4>PIAAC ‚Äì¬†Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies</h4>
The OECD also surveys the skills of adults.¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/piaac-mean-adult-numeracy-proficiency-2012-2015">Here</a> is the world map showing the level of numeracy of adults that gives an idea of the covered area.

<h4>PASEC ‚Äì¬†Programme for the Analysis of Education Systems</h4>
PASEC, which in the original French refers to¬†<em>Programme d‚Äô Analyse des Syst√®mes Educatifs</em>, has assessed educational outcomes in 13 countries in <strong>Francophone West Africa</strong>. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pasec-mean-performance-on-the-french-language-scale-for-5th-grade-students-2004-2010">Here</a> is a map of outcomes in the dimension of the French language.

ASER is a report that is¬†based on a survey of more than 500,000 children in rural areas across <strong>India</strong>. It is not a school-based, but instead an in-home assessment of the reading and mathematical skills of children between 3 and 16. The first ASER was carried out in 2005.
<h4>UWEZO</h4>
UWEZO is an adaptation of ASER carried out in <strong>three east African countries</strong> (Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya). It has been done since 2009 and is carried out annually.
<h4 class="p1">SACMEQ ‚Äì Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Measuring Educational Quality</h4>
An assessment carried out by education ministries from fifteen <strong>southern and eastern African countries</strong>. The study assesses students in grade 6 in the domains of reading and mathematics. The first study was carried out in 1995. The studies' website is: <a href="http://www.sacmeq.org/">www.sacmeq.org</a>

<h3>Studies that combine educational outcome measures</h3>

With a multitude on different assessments of learning outcomes which focus on different geographical areas and different skills it is an obvious idea to try to combine these measures into a common system to get a more comprehensive perspective on educational outcomes across the world. Several researchers have attempted to do this.
<h4>Altinok, Diebolt &amp; Demeulemeester (2014)</h4>
The researchers Altinok, Diebolt &amp; Demeulemeester published their dataset and their accompanying paper under the title<em> A new international database on education quality: 1965‚Äì2010.</em>[ref]Nadir Altinok, Claude Diebolt &amp; Jean-Luc Demeulemeester (2014) ‚Äì <em>A new international database on education quality: 1965‚Äì2010</em>. In Applied Economics, 46:11, 1212-1247, DOI: 10.1080/00036846.2013.868592[/ref]

The authors write that they "merge all existing regional and international student achievement tests by using a specific methodology". The resulting dataset includes indicators of the quality of student achievement for 103 countries/areas in primary education and 111 countries/areas in secondary education between 1965 and 2010.
<h4>Hanushek and W√∂√ümann (2012)</h4>
The education economists Eric Hanushek and Ludger W√∂√ümann are combining the results from educational achievement tests to investigate the question whether the quality of education has a causal influence on the growth of the economy.[ref]Hanushek, E. A. and Woessmann, L. (2012) ‚Äì <em>Do better school lead to more growth? Cognitive skills, economic outcomes, and causation</em>. In Journal of Economic Growth, 17, 267‚Äì321. The paper is available <a href="http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%2BWoessmann%202012%20JEconGrowth%2017%284%29.pdf">on Eric Hanushek's website</a>¬†and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-012-9081-x">at the journal's site</a>.[/ref]

The database the authors published ‚Äì and which is available on the <a href="http://www.cesifo.de/ifoHome/CESifo-Group/ifo/ifo-Mitarbeiter/cvifo-woessmann_l/Ludger-Woessmann--Data.html">authors'</a> <a href="http://hanushek.stanford.edu/download">websites</a> ‚Äì includes measure for 77 countries. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-test-score-in-mathematics-and-science">This map</a> shows their main test score.

They extend earlier efforts by¬†Hanushek and Kimko (2000) published in the American Economic Review.[ref]Hanushek, E. A., &amp; Kimko, D. D. (2000) ‚Äì <em>Schooling, labor force quality, and the growth of nations</em>. American Economic Review, 90(5), 1184‚Äì1208.[/ref]

<h3>Literacy</h3>
Literacy is the learning outcome with the widest available data, both geographically and over time.

Literacy and illiteracy rates and absolute number of people for many countries are available by age group and by sex. For many countries literacy data is available for the last decades and for some countries data is also available for the last several centuries.

In the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/">Our World in Data entry on literacy</a> you find more information and a presentation of the most important data.

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Education Equality</h2>
Datasets that publish estimates of mean years of schooling often also provide estimates of the <strong>inequality of years of schooling</strong> in a population. The most common metric used to capture this inequality is the Gini index.

Also surveys ‚Äì such as the <em>Demographic and Health Survey</em> (DHS) and the¬†<em>Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey</em> (MICS) ‚Äì publish Gini rates of average years of schooling.

To measure <strong>gender inequality</strong> it is common practice to report <strong>ratios</strong> of metrics for males and females, such as the ratio between average years of schooling of women and men. The UNESCO often refers to this ratio as the "Gender Parity Index".

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Teachers</h2>
Several measures on teachers are available across countries ‚Äì many of which you find visualized in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/teachers-and-professors/">our entry on teachers and professors</a>:

<strong>Absolute number of teachers:</strong> The¬†UNESCO Institute for Statistics publishes the absolute number of teachers by sex and level of education (primary, secondary, and tertiary)

<strong>Share of female teachers:¬†</strong>These share, broken down by level of education, are by the¬†UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

<strong>Share of teachers who are trained</strong>: Data on the¬†share of teachers who have received the minimum organized teacher training (pre-service or in-service) required for teaching at a given level of education in a particular country is also published by the¬†UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This data is available is also available by sex and the ratio between the two measures is published as the¬†gender parity index (GPI).

<strong>Pupil-to-teacher ratio:</strong> These ratios, broken down by level of education, are also published by the¬†UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

Also published are the¬†<strong>ratios of the number of 'teacher training graduates' to teachers who are currently working</strong>.[ref]In the World Bank's EdStats dataset this information is only available in the regional Africa Dataset.[/ref]

<strong>Annual teacher salaries in US-$:</strong> Data on salaries of teachers is published by level of education and additionally by experience of the teacher by the OECD. The OECD breaks this down by starting salary, 10 years of experience,¬†15 years of experience, and top of scale salary.

Salaries are reported as gross salaries ‚Äì the total sum paid by the employer. Income taxes are not deducted in these reported salaries, but the employer‚Äôs contribution to social security and pension is deducted. The OECD adds that¬†"teachers‚Äô salaries are one component of teachers‚Äô total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachers‚Äô total remuneration."

Additionally the OECD differentiates between statutory salaries ‚Äì "the scheduled salaries according to official pay scales" ‚Äì and actual salaries ‚Äì "the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher".

As an example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-salary-of-primary-teachers-with-10-years-of-experience">here is a map</a> of salary of primary teachers.

<strong>All staff compensation as share of total expenditure in public institutions:</strong>¬†This measure is published by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics and is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/all-staff-compensation-as-share-of-total-expenditure-in-public-institutions">available for more than just the OECD countries</a>. It includes the compensation of all staff (teacher and non-teachers) and expresses this as the share of direct expenditure in public educational institutions (instructional and non-instructional). Staff compensation includes salaries, contributions by employers for staff retirement programmes, and other allowances and benefits.
<h2>Measures on School Infrastructure</h2>
There is some data available on the infrastructure in schools.¬†In the World Bank's <em>EdStats</em> dataset the following information is available in the regional <em>Africa Dataset</em> only:
<ul>
 	<li>Data is available for the¬†share of schools with and without access to <strong>electricity</strong>, <strong>toilets</strong> (broken down by single-sex and mixed-sex toilets), and <strong>access to potable water</strong>.</li>
 	<li>There is also some data on the average number of pupils per mathematics (and reading) <strong>textbook</strong> in primary education.</li>
 	<li>Data on average <strong>class sizes</strong> is also available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measures on Expenditure on Education</h2>
Data is available on the expenditure on the educational systems in several dimensions. For visualizations of some of the empirical data and research see <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education">our entry on financing of education</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Education Systems</h2>
Data is available on the structure of the educational systems in several dimensions:
<ul>
 	<li>The¬†<em>UNESCO Institute for Statistics</em> publishes data on the "<strong>Duration of compulsory education</strong>", the "Official <strong>entrance age</strong> to compulsory education", and also more detailed information such as official entrance age and theoretical duration of the different levels of education ‚Äì such as pre-primary education, primary education, and (lower and upper) secondary educational level.</li>
 	<li>The UNESCO also publishes the "<strong>theoretical duration</strong>" ‚Äì measured in number of grades (in years) ‚Äì by level of education.</li>
 	<li>Enrollment in <strong>private and public institutions</strong> is available. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-enrolled-in-private-institutions-at-the-primary-education-level">Here</a> is a map for primary education as an example.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>International Mobility</h2>
At the tertiary education level data is available on the international mobility of students:
<ul>
 	<li>The <strong>inbound mobility rate</strong> is the ratio between the number of students from abroad studying in a given country and the the total number of enrolled students in that country. It is also available by sex and level of education.</li>
 	<li>For outgoing students of a particular country the <strong>outbound mobility rate</strong> is published.</li>
</ul>
Maps of both measures can be found in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/tertiary-education/#international-mobility-of-students">our entry on tertiary education</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2>Measures on Educational Policy</h2>
<h4>SABER ‚Äì¬†Systems Approach for Better Education Results</h4>
SABER is an effort by the World Bank to produce comparative data on education system policies and institutions. Published are a range of policy metrics on management systems, teachers, student assessments, school health and school feeding, school autonomy and accountability, school finance, workforce development, and early childhood development. The website is <a href="http://saber.worldbank.org/index.cfm">here</a>.

<h2>Sources for data on educational attainment</h2>
Census and registers published by the national statistical offices are the most reliable source for educational attainment. But not all countries have built the capabilities to produce such statistics. Which data sources do we have available when census and register data is not available?

The world map below is published by the researchers of IIASA who assembled a global dataset of educational attainment for their research and searched for the most accurate data source for each country. The original datasources, which were seen as the most accurate in each country, are shown in the world map below.

We see that the IIASA researchers rank censuses as the most reliable data sources and in the absence of these they rely on survey data, preferably on labor force surveys or national surveys and if these are not available either on the DHS (for many African countries) or other in rare cases other surveys. The authors <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">write</a> that for "the remaining 24‚Äîmostly small‚Äîcountries, assumptions on the education structure had to be made by analogy."

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-world-population-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Future World Population Growth</a></strong>.</div>
Hans Rosling famously <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies/transcript">coined the term</a>¬†'peak child' for the moment in global demographic history at which the number of children in the world stops increasing.

In this post I look into the latest data ‚Äì and various demographic projections ‚Äì to ask when the world will reach 'peak child' and how the number of children in the world will evolve in the future.

From studying this question we can learn two things: First, it allows us to understand how the world's population will continue to evolve.

Second, projections of the number of children in the world provide insights into the upper limit of demand for education in the future.[ref]While there might be children who will not receive education, it is clear that the absolute number of children is the upper bound for the total demand for childhood education.[/ref]¬†If we want to understand the challenges for educating the world's population of tomorrow, then we must have a good understanding of how the number of young children will evolve.

A quick preview of the results:
<ul>
 	<li>The world has probably not reached 'peak child' yet. However, we are likely very close to a long flat peak; the number of children in the world will not increase much more. We are close to the peak.</li>
 	<li>A key insight from projections, under different scenarios, is that the number of children in the long-run will depend on how successful the world will be in providing education ‚Äì in particular to women ‚Äì in the short-run. This is because women that are better educated tend to have fewer children. If we are successful in providing accessible education for all in the near-term, there will be fewer children ‚Äì and therefore less demand for education ‚Äì in the future.</li>
 	<li>In the last part of this post I will discuss how the size of the population will change in different world regions. Crucial will be the African continent: fast development in Africa will slow down population growth, whereas slow development would leave African countries in an extended period of fast population growth. The latter scenario could see the African population growing 5-fold over the 21st century.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thelastdecadesandthenextdecades">The last decades and the next decades</h3>
Between 1950 and today the world population tripled: from 2.5 billion to 7.5 billion. Over this period educational systems around the world had to provide education for substantially larger cohorts of children at school age.¬†Since 1950 the total number of children younger than 15 years of age increased rapidly, from 0.87 billion children to 1.96 billion today. The world was largely successful in getting more children into school; while the number of children increased globally there were fewer and fewer out-of-school children. In the last two decades the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/out-of-school-children-of-primary-school-age-by-world-region">number of out-of-school children has almost halved</a>.

The future will be very different from the past. Over recent decades we have seen global demographic changes which will bring about the end of rapid population growth: Until the mid-1960s each woman around the world had on average 5 children. Since then the number of children has halved and is now just below 2.5 children per woman. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL">global fertility rate has halved</a>.

Based on these demographic changes the UN Population Division makes projections of how the world population will change until the end of this century. The Medium Variant of this projection is shown in the visualization below and it shows that with respect to demographic changes the challenges for providing education in this century will be substantially smaller than in the last century. With a much lower global fertility rate, the increase in educational pressures will be much slower than the last 50 years. In fact the number of children will rise only very slowly and will barely increase at all over the coming century. The UN expects the number of children to peak in 2057 at 2.09 billion children and by the end of the century the number of children will be basically the same as today (just below 2 billion in the UN forecast).[ref]The number of children younger than 15 years:
In 1950: 0.87 billion
In 2017: 1.96 billion
Peak in 2057: 2.094 billion
In 2100: 1.98 billion[/ref]

Since the middle of the 20th century the number of school-age-children increased by 125%. From today to the peak number of children, the number of children will only increase by 7%. If these projections are correct, then the world is not quite at 'peak child' yet, but we are approaching a flat plateau at which, over the course of the next 4 decades, we will gradually reach a very flat peak.[ref]This can also be seen in how the global population pyramid has evolved ‚Äì we have visualized the pyramid <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/World-Population-Pyramid-for-1950-2016-2100.png">here</a>. The base of the pyramid has widened greatly since 1950, but over the decades until the end of the century it is projected to shrink for the very young cohorts.[/ref]

While over the last decades the world‚Äôs educational systems were strained with the task of¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/primary-and-secondary-education">substantially increasing the <em>quantity</em> of education</a>, from today until 2100 there will be little increase in the number of school-aged children. We can therefore focus our efforts instead on increasing the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education"><em>quality</em> of education</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-demand-for-education-world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-by-age-group-in-thousands-of-people" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3 id="thelinkbetweeneducationintheshort-runandthesizeoftheglobalpopulationinthelong-run">The link between education in the short-run and the size of the population in the long-run</h3>
Population growth is driven by three changes: Fertility, mortality, and migration. Until space travel becomes an option it is only the first two aspects only that matter at the global level.

Education matters for both mortality and fertility:

<strong>Education ‚Äì&gt; Mortality ‚Äì&gt; Fertility rates:¬†</strong>The education of mothers is important for the health and mortality of children and there is a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/#better-education-of-women-reduces-child-mortality">strong link</a> between higher education of mothers and lower mortality of their children.[ref]See for example Emmanuela Gakidou, Krycia Cowling, Rafael Lozano, Christopher JL Murray (2010) ‚Äì¬†<a href="http://can-mnch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5.-EducationandChildSurvivalLancet.pdf">Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis</a>, The Lancet, Volume 376, Issue 9745, 18‚Äì24 September 2010, Pages 959-974, ISSN 0140-6736, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3.[/ref]

A reduction of child mortality would of course directly increase the number of children. However, it is more complicated than that. In addition to this direct effect of fewer child deaths there is an important indirect effect: When fewer children die, families decide to have fewer children in the first place which results in a decline in fertility rates. This is an important part of the reason why <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-population-growth">population growth is low where the¬†mortality of children is low</a>.
<p id="education‚Äìfertility"><strong>Education ‚Äì&gt; Fertility rates:</strong>¬†From demographic research we know that improving¬†the education of women has been one of the most important drivers of the halving of the global fertility rate from 5 to 2.5 children per woman over the last 4 decades. Today,¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth?time=2015">population growth is high where fertility remains high</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility?time=2010">fertility rates remain high where the education of women remains low</a>.</p>
In the entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#what-explains-the-change-in-the-number-of-children-women-have">fertility rates</a> we present the research that shows that this is not just a correlation; better education indeed causes a decline in the number of children per woman. This is the key mechanism at work here.

<strong>Education ‚Äì&gt; Population growth</strong>

Today it is the fertility rate that matters for population growth.[ref]The researchers Lutz, Butz, and KC summarize saying ‚Äúthe calculations [‚Ä¶] show that the drop in fertility has a far greater net effect than improved child survival rates. As a result, better education is associated with a clear reduction in population growth. For this reason, universal female education ‚Äì in addition to its many other positive implications ‚Äì is likely an effective way to slow the world‚Äôs population growth.‚Äù

In Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC [Editors] (2014)¬†‚Äì Executive Summary: World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press. Online <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]

One way to see that the fertility rate is key ‚Äì and not child mortality ‚Äì is to look at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-population-growth">the correlation between the two measures</a>. A second way to see this is to play out a scenario in which fertility rates would stay at their current level ‚Äì the UN has such an illustrative scenario with constant fertility rates and in this scenario the world population would continue to grow extremely fast and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/comparison-of-world-population-projections">reach a population of 26 billion</a>(!) in the year 2100. The fertility rate is what matters for population growth and education therefore matters because it is a strong determinant of fertility rates.
<h3>The WC-IIASA projections: How investments in education matter for the global population in the 21st century</h3>
In this post I am focussing on two sets of projections: the UN projections ‚Äì as they are the most widely discussed projections ‚Äì and the projections published by IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre, which I refer to as the WC-IIASA projections.[ref] These projections are presented in detail in Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/world-population-and-human-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century-9780198703167?cc=us&lang=en&">Editors</a> ‚Äì World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press.

The website of the book is here:¬†<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/world-population-and-human-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century‚Äì9780198703167?cc=at&amp;lang=en&amp;">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/world-population-and-human-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century‚Äì9780198703167?cc=at&amp;lang=en&amp;</a>
The executive summary is here:¬†<a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf</a>

The work is produced at two closely related research centers in Austria:
<ol>
 	<li>The first of these institutions is the <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Introduction.html">World Population Program (POP)</a> at the <em>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</em> (IIASA).</li>
 	<li>And the second institution is the <em><a href="http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm">Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital</a>.</em></li>
</ol>
Available are these projections <a href="http://dataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org/shiny/wic/">here</a>.[/ref]

Future projections of global population are uncertain. Much of the uncertainty comes from the fact that we do not know which investments the world will make in those systems that determine mortality and fertility ‚Äì most importantly in education, as we have just explored.

The WC-IIASA projections differ from the work of the United Nations in a number of <a href="https://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">fundamental ways</a>¬†‚Äì see the footnote for details.[ref]The UN projections take into account the historical data on each country‚Äôs demography and build projections based on this quantitative information.

In contrast to this, the WC-IIASA projections also take into account the <em>qualitative</em> assessments of 550 demographers from around the world which the WC-IIASA researchers have surveyed to gather their ideas on how population change in different parts of the world will play out. They then combine the country specific expertise of these researchers with similar quantitative information that the UN and others rely on as well.

The assumptions behind the projections are presented in more detail in Wolfgang¬†Lutz and Samir KC (2017) ‚Äì The human core of the shared socioeconomic pathways: Population scenarios by age, sex and level of education for all countries to 2100. In Global Environmental Change Volume 42, January 2017, Pages 181‚Äì192. Online here:¬†<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001095">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001095</a>[/ref]. While the projections by WC-IIASA are less widely known than the UN projections, the WC-IIASA work is certainly very respected among demographers and key publications by the researchers are regularly published in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.[ref] Lutz, W., Sanderson, W. C., &amp; Scherbov, S. (1997). Doubling of world population unlikely. Nature, 387(6635), 803‚Äì805.

Lutz, W., Sanderson, W. C., &amp; Scherbov, S. (2001). The end of world population growth. Nature, 412(6846), 543‚Äì545.

Most importantly for our discussion here is that while other projections only structure demographic data by sex and age-group, the WC-IIASA data also breaks down the population data by the level of highest <em>educational attainment</em>. This information on educational attainment is then used for both the output of the model ‚Äì so that population projections for each country of the world by highest educational attainment are available (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">on Our World in Data here</a>). And crucially this information on education is also used as an input to the model so that the impact of different future scenarios for education on both mortality and fertility can be modeled explicitly.

The level of highest educational attainment is categorized in a system that aims to capture the structure of populations across the different country-specific educational systems ‚Äì see the footnote for details.[ref]These categorizations are based on the the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which was designed by the UNESCO to make education statistics comparable across countries. WC-IIASA breaks down the educational structure into the following 6 categories and the table summarizes how the six categories are defined, how they correspond to ISCED 1997, and the main allocation rules the researchers used.

<h4 id="fourfuturescenariosforglobaleducation">The four future scenarios for global education</h4>
The researchers developed 4 different basic scenarios to model the demographic structure of the global population:[ref]In addition to these 4 basic scenarios there are¬†a larger number of combinations based on these scenarios used in the WC-IIASA work.[/ref]

<strong>Constant Enrollment Numbers (CEN) scenario:</strong> This is the researcher's most pessimistic scenario. Here it is assumed that in the future no more schools are opened in any place in the world, and so the absolute number of people reaching a particular educational level is frozen at the current level.[ref]This implies that enrollment rates are declining when the population size increases. In practice the WC-IIASA researchers almost always consider CER as the most pessimistic scenario and only rarely discuss CEN.[/ref]

<strong>Constant Enrollment Rates (CER) scenario</strong>: This is another pessimistic scenario. While in the CEN scenario the absolute <em>number</em>¬†of enrolled students stagnates, the assumption in the CER scenario is that the <em>rate </em>of enrollment stagnates. In this scenario the most recently observed rates of educational enrollment are frozen at their current rate and no further improvement in enrollment is assumed.
This will still result in further improvements of adult education because in many countries the younger cohorts are better educated than the older ones. But in the longer run this scenario also implies stagnation.

<strong>Fast Track (FT) scenario:</strong> This scenario is the most optimistic one and here it is assumed that countries follow the most rapid education expansion achieved in recent history ‚Äì that of South Korea.

<strong>Global Education Trend (GET) scenario:</strong> This is the middle scenario and here the researchers assume that countries will follow the average path of educational expansion that countries further advanced in this process have experienced.
In this scenario the researchers project the medium future trajectory based on the experience of all countries over the past 40 years
The researchers write:¬†‚ÄúThe GET scenario is moderately optimistic, and can be considered as the most likely.‚Äù[ref]Wolfgang Lutz, William P. Butz, and Samir KC [Editors] (2014)¬†‚Äì Executive Summary: World Population and Human Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Oxford University Press. <a href="http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf">http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11189/1/XO-14-031.pdf</a>[/ref]
<h3 id="thesizeandstructureoftheworldpopulationunderdifferenteducationalscenarios">The size and structure of the world population under different educational scenarios</h3>
Now we can see how the size of the total world population and the educational achievements of this population will evolve under these four scenarios.

In the visualization below we see that these differences matter very substantially even for the evolution of world population over the next 5 decades. By 2060 the world population is projected to reach 9.8 billion under the Constant Enrollment Rates (CER) scenario, which is pessimistic about improvements in global education. If we assume optimistic progress in global education, as in the Fast Track (FT) scenario, global population is projected to increase to only 8.9 billion. A difference of almost one billion¬†‚Äì as early as 2060 ‚Äì may therefore be solely driven by differences in progress on global education.

The result that alternative education scenarios alone make a difference of one billion for the global population over such a short time frame is shown in more detail in a publication in Science by Lutz and KC (2011)[ref] Lutz, Wolfgang and Samir KC (2011) ‚Äì Global human capital: integrating education and population. In Science,¬†333¬†(2011), pp.¬†587‚Äì592 <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/587.full">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6042/587.full</a>

The changes of the demographic structure of the world population stem from two forces predominantly: Firstly the different assumptions about the trajectories in female educational attainment, and secondly, different levels of education-specific fertility.
In the analysis below, the education-specific fertility levels will differ across scenarios, but to gauge the importance of different possible trajectories I am here interested in the effect of the different assumptions about the trajectories of educational attainment. This lets us see the impact of different futures with respect to educational attainment¬†alone.[/ref].

While the differences between the educational scenarios are slow to materialize and only show up after some decades,[ref]As can be seen from the chart, improvements in the education of women will eventually have a large impact on the size of the global population. But for two reasons the impact of educational improvements in the short-run will take some time to become apparent on a global scale: The first reason for this lag is that a girl who receives additional education now will only be in her childbearing years in 15 to 20 years.¬†The second reason is that population momentum, driven by a high proportion of women in their child bearing years, can mean that the population keeps on growing even if the fertility rate falls to the replacement level.[/ref] they are then very substantial and matter hugely for the size of the future world population.¬†Our attention and progress in education now will really matter for the size of the global population.

<h3 id="differencebetweenthemediumunandwc-iiasascenarios">Global demand for education: The population of school-age children</h3>
Let's see how different possible scenarios in educational improvements matter for 'peak child' and the size of the population in school age. For this we rely on scenarios of the WC-IIASA researchers which differ only in the assumptions on educational attainment.[ref]Otherwise they are identical and are all based on the¬†SSP2 scenarios, which the researchers see as their most likely scenario as it combines the medium fertility and medium mortality assumptions.

In these different scenarios <em>education-specific fertility levels</em>¬†now also differ across scenarios, which means that the differences across scenarios are even larger than in the projections above where education-specific fertility levels were the same across the different scenarios.[/ref]

The visualization below shows the three projections of the size of the population of school-age-children until the end of this century:
<ul>
 	<li>According to the projection of the pessimistic¬†<em>Constant Enrollment Scenario</em> the population younger than 15 will evolve similarly to the Medium Variant projection of the UN. The number of children will continue to increase slowly and reach a plateau in the mid-21st century before the population will decline to a size similar to today‚Äôs population of under-15-year-olds.</li>
 	<li>Therefore the medium projection of WC-IIASA substantially differs from the UN‚Äôs Medium projection. In the most likely scenario ‚Äì¬†<em>Global Education Trends</em> (GET), which the WC-IIASA researchers see as a continuation of the recent educational trends ‚Äì the size of the population younger than 15 will soon start to fall and at the end of the century the population of under-15-year-olds will be one-third smaller than today! According to this middle-of-the-road scenario by WC-IIASA the world is very close to 'child peak', as Hans Rosling claimed.</li>
 	<li>Even faster will be the decline in the <em>Fast Track</em> scenario. If the world can achieve such a rapid expansion of education, then the size of the population of under-15-year-olds is projected to fall and decline to just one billion in 2100 (almost the same level as 1950).</li>
</ul>
What this comparison of scenarios shows us is that the size of the global population younger than 15¬†‚Äì the upper bound for the global demand for education¬†‚Äì will very much depend on how rapidly access to education can be extended.[ref]It would be interesting to see the projected number of enrolled students under 15 by multiplying the projected enrollment rates with the projected population younger than 15, but unfortunately the underlying enrollment rates cannot be obtained from the <em>WC-IIASA dataexplorer</em>.[/ref]

A larger increase in the educational attainment in the short-run will mean that the size of cohorts that need investments in the long-run will be much smaller: The difference between no further improvements in the educational enrollment (CER scenario) and a continuation of the successful last decades will mean that the global population of under-15-year-olds will be half a billion smaller at the end of the century. An acceleration to the Fast Track (FT) scenario would mean that this global figure is again smaller by yet another 200 million children.

<h3 id="continentbycontinent‚Äìtotalpopulation">Continent by continent ‚Äì total population</h3>
So far we have looked at the total figures for the global population. What we have not yet taken into account is how the size of the population will evolve in different regions and countries of the world.
<h4 id="un">Total population: UN</h4>
The Medium Variant of the UN projections for all world regions until the end of this century is shown in the chart below. Changes to the population size of the Americas, Oceania, and Europe are very small compared to the large expected changes in Asia and Africa. The UN expects the population of Africa to quadruple from 1.2 billion in 2017 to 4.5 billion by the end of the century. This means the population of Africa will be as large as the population of Asia today, and the rate of this increase in the coming decades will also be very similar to the rate of population growth in Asia over the last few decades (when Asia's population increased from 1.4 billion in 1950 to 4.5 billion today).

For Asia, the UN projects an increase only until the mid-21st century when population is projected to plateau around 5.3 billion. In the second half of the 21st century, researchers foresee a decline of the Asian population to less than 5 billion by 2100.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4 id="wc-iiasa">Total population: WC-IIASA</h4>
The visualization below now shows in contrast the projections of the WC-IIASA researchers. Again the projected changes in the Americas, Oceania, and Europe are modest compared to changes in Africa and Asia. For Asia, this medium scenario by WC-IIASA projects an evolution that is very similar to the UN projection: The population will increase until the mid-21st century when the population plateaus (on a slightly lower level than in the UN projections) and then falls to well below 5 billion until the year 2100.

The big difference is Africa: While the UN projects that the population of Africa will quadruple, the WC-IIASA researchers expect only a doubling. This means the African population will stay well below 3 billion, with population growth almost coming to a halt at the end of this century.

The projections by education scenario can be seen <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-of-the-total-population-by-education-scenario">in this chart</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Projections-of-the-world-population-until-2100-by-the-Wittgenstein-Centre" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3 id="continentbycontinent‚Äìfertilityrate">Continent by continent ‚Äì Fertility rate</h3>
As we have seen above, the crucial variable for how the world population will evolve is the total fertility rate: the number of children per woman. Let's see how this crucial variable is projected to evolve.

There is some uncertainty about the level of the fertility rate today in some countries with poorer coverage of demographic statistics. This discrepancy in estimates today is also obvious in the comparison of the UN and WC-IIASA, where the UN mostly assumes that fertility rates <em>today</em> are higher than those assumed by WC-IIASA.
For the development over the next century however the changes over time are more fundamental. So let‚Äôs see what the projections of the UN and WC-IIASA entail.
<h4 id="un">Fertility rate: UN</h4>
The UN series shows that until 1966 women around the world had more than 5 children on average. Since then the fertility rate has halved and is now just below 2.5 children per woman. The UN projects that the fertility rate will further decline to 2.1 in 2070 and by the end of the century the fertility rate will fall below 2. A global fertility rate of 1.96 then would imply a decline of the global population over the long run.

In Africa the fertility rate only fell below 5 in 2005 ‚Äì four decades later than the global average. For the 21st century the UN Medium Variant projects a slow decline of the fertility rate in Africa to 2.1 children per woman until the end of the century.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-fertility-rate-by-development-level-including-UN-projections-through-2100?country=Africa-0+Africa-1+OWID_WRL-0+OWID_WRL-1" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4 id="wc-iiasa">Fertility rate: WC-IIASA</h4>
In their medium scenario ‚Äì SSP2 with the GET assumptions on global education ‚Äì the researchers project a much faster decline of the fertility rate than the UN. As early as the 2050s, the fertility rate will fall below 2 and by the end of the century will be 1.68 children per woman.

Africa too will reach a fertility rate below 2 by the 2070s under the medium assumptions ‚Äì you can add the projections for Africa by clicking the option "add projection" below the chart.

Interestingly the projections for the total fertility rate under the pessimistic Constant Enrollment Rates (CER) scenario are very similar to the UN Medium projection. Under this scenario the WC-IIASA researchers project a global fertility rate just below 2 and a fertility rate for Africa just above 2. The pessimistic scenario of WC-IIASA is similar to the UN Medium projection, and all of the more optimistic WC-IIASA scenarios imply lower fertility rates. In these optimistic scenarios, the global population is therefore significantly smaller at the end of the century, with smaller cohorts of school-age children throughout this period.

In the past decades UN demographers have been consistently too pessimistic in their projections of the global fertility rates <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-world-population-growth/#global-average-fertility-rate-and-life-expectancy">as we show in our assessment of the past UN projections</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-of-the-number-of-children-per-woman-by-education-scenario" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3 id="continentbycontinent‚Äìpopulationyoungerthan15">Continent by continent ‚Äì population younger than 15</h3>
To see how the number of children in school age will evolve in different parts of the world, below we look at the population younger than 15 in all world regions separately and again compare the projections by the UN with those by WC-IIASA researchers.
<h4>Population younger than 15: UN</h4>
Shown below are the UN projections until the year 2100. Again, note the familiar picture of stagnating population sizes in Oceania, the Americas, and Europe. Due to the low fertility rates in Asia the UN projects a substantial decrease in the number of under-15-year-olds over the coming decades, falling from 1.1 billion today to 0.7 billion by 2100.

For Africa the UN projects an increase from 0.5 billion under-15-year-olds today to a peak of almost 1 billion in the 2090s when the number of children at school age is projected to start to decline.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-younger-than-15-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4 id="wc-iiasa">Population younger than 15: WC-IIASA</h4>
Now let us compare this with the projection of the world population by world region according to the medium projection of WC-IIASA ‚Äì the SSP2 scenario with the GET assumption on global educational improvements. For Asia the researchers project an even more substantial decline to just over half a billion in the year 2100. An even more substantial difference is projected for Africa where they project that the increase of the school-age population comes to an end below 600 million as early as 2050. By the end of the century the researchers expect a population of under-15-year-olds that is barely larger than today.

<h2 id="africaisgoingtobecrucial">Africa is going to be crucial</h2>
What we have seen in the different projections of future global population is that Africa is the most influential and contentious. What happens in Africa now and in the coming decades will determine what size and structure the global population will have at the end of the century.[ref]On this see also Wolfgang Fengler (2015) ‚Äì Will the world reach 10 billion people? - Brookings Institution. Online here: <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/09/04/will-the-world-reach-10-billion-people/">https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2015/09/04/will-the-world-reach-10-billion-people/</a>[/ref]

It seems less certain what the future for Africa will look like; there is considerable disagreement between UN and WC-IIASA projections. Even the medium projections vary significantly between the two institutions: The UN projects a population of 4.5 billion while WC-IIASA projects a population of only 2.6 billion. This difference of 2 billion is just as large as the difference between the projection for the global population by the UN (11.2 billion in 2100) and WC-IIASA (8.9 billion in 2100). Whether the world population increases to more than 10 billion will be decided by the speed with which Africa develops ‚Äì especially how quickly women get access to better education, women's opportunities within the job market, and how rapidly the improvements in child health continue.

This also matters significantly for some particular countries: For example, in Nigeria (currently a population of 190 million) the UN projects a population of 794 million at the end of the century. WC-IIASA, however, projects the population to be more than 25 percent smaller at 576 million.

Currently the total fertility rate in Africa still stands at 4.5 children per woman. It took 42 years (from 1972 to 2014) for global fertility to fall from 4.5 to 2.5 children. The UN projects that for Africa it will take longer than that ‚Äì 56 years (from 2016 to 2072) ‚Äì while the WC-IIASA researchers project a faster decline.

There are reasons to be optimistic that Africa could develop faster than the projections of the UN assume:

We know that falling mortality is associated with a decline of fertility. And health in Africa is improving:
‚Äì The child mortality rate in Africa has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-around-the-world">halved over the last two decades</a>.
‚Äì HIV/AIDS is still a serious threat, but the epidemic is past its peak and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/incidence-of-hiv-the-share-of-new-infections-among-the-previously-uninfected-population-ages-15-49?tab=chart&amp;country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa">incidence rate in Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by two thirds in the last 2 decades</a>.
‚Äì Malaria too is in steep decline and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-malaria-deaths-by-world-region">annual number of deaths has almost halved in just the last 15 years</a>.

‚Äì Crucially, education has also changed substantially across Africa: <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/10">The young generation is much better educated than older generations</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Share-primary-school-age-out-of-school?country=Sub-Saharan%20Africa+Middle%20East%20%26%20North%20Africa">the share of children out of school is falling rapidly</a>.
‚Äì After decades of stagnation in many parts of Africa,¬† economies across the continent are now growing and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-in-extreme-poverty-by-world-region">the share of the population in extreme poverty is now falling</a>.

If you want to see more on how Africa is changing have a look at our slide show at <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/title-slide">AfricaInData.org</a>.

Still, living conditions in most parts of the African continent are very poor and it would be too early to say that the changes that we are seeing now are foreshadowing the improvements which will lower fertility rates rapidly. This will be determined only in the coming years, and the quantity and quality of education will be crucial as the visualization below shows. How quickly global population growth will slow will be decided by the chance of girls to go to school and the chances they have in life afterwards.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-of-the-population-younger-than-15-in-africa-by-education-scenario" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3 id="theworldpopulationbyeducationalstructure">The world population by educational structure</h3>
So what will be the result of these global demographic changes? The middle scenario by WC-IIASA for the educational structure of the world population is shown in the chart below.

We already know that the future population will be better educated than today‚Äôs population because in the vast majority of countries the younger cohorts are much better educated than the older cohorts.[ref]This can be also seen well in the scenarios that assume no further improvement in attainment such as the CER scenarios in the WC-IIASA projections.[/ref]

The projection also shows that we will likely not see a rapid increase in the number of children in the world ‚Äì we are likely not quite there yet, but the world is close to 'peak child'.

'Peak child' is a historic turning point in global demographic history ‚Äì after two centuries of rapid global population growth it will bring about the end of this era. And from the discussion of the various scenarios for the coming years we know that faster development ‚Äì the access to education for women in particular and further improvements of child health are especially important ‚Äì will mean that we are even closer to 'peak child'.

This short post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maternal Mortality</a></strong>.</div>
What could be more tragic than a mother losing her life in the moment that she is giving life to her newborn? The visualization below shows how common this once was. In Finland ‚Äì the country that today boasts the lowest maternal mortality in the world ‚Äì we see that during much of the 19th century, maternal mortality hung between 800 and 1,000 deaths for every 100,000 births. In other words, each birth came with up to a 0.9% chance of death. And since women in Finland <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-fertility-rate?tab=chart&amp;country=FIN">gave birth to 5 children</a> on average at the time, this meant that the death of a new mother was no rare occurrence.

The visualization also shows how maternal mortality has changed since then. Starting in the second half of the 19th century, the risk of dying during or after pregnancy has declined from 0.9% to 0.003%. Today, giving birth is 300-times safer than just a few generations ago. How was this possible?

<h3>Measurement and progress: The story of Ignaz Semmelweis</h3>
The story of the decline of maternal mortality is a story about scientific research and the importance of measurement. It began with an accidental controlled trial.

In the mid-19th century, the largest maternity hospital in the world was in Vienna, and the most common cause of maternal deaths was puerperal sepsis (an infection of the uterus that killed new mothers shortly after childbirth).[ref]Irvine Loudon (1992) ‚Äì The transformation of maternal mortality. BMJ 1992; 305:1557 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6868.1557 (Published 19 December 1992)[/ref] There was an unexplained but stark pattern taking place in the Vienna Maternity Hospital. The institution was divided into two wings: doctors and medical students were taught in the first, and midwives were taught in the second. In the first wing, every tenth (!) mother died of puerperal sepsis, while in the second 'only' one in 25 died. Crucially, women were admitted to the clinics not on the basis of how complicated their case was, but simply on alternate days ‚Äì in other words, by random allocation. Unintentionally, the hospital had created the conditions suitable for a natural experiment.

In 1846, the young Viennese doctor Ignaz Semmelweis was appointed to the hospital. And it was his suspicion that differences in the routine practices of the two wings would give him insight into what was causing the alarmingly high mortality rates in one. He noticed that in the first wing, where 10% of mothers perished, medical students alternated between helping women to give birth and attending post-mortem examinations of women who had died of puerperal sepsis. They carried out their work in ordinary daytime clothing rather than clean, white coats, and between autopsies and deliveries, they did not wash their hands. By contrast, the pupil midwives in the second clinic did not perform postmortem examinations. And thus, many years before the role of bacteria in diseases was known, Semmelweis discovered that the disease under his study was contagious, and that doctors were transmitting it.

Semmelweis also found that a chemical would destroy the agent that led to the disease, and therefore insisted that his students disinfect their hands with it before attending the labour wards. This led to dramatic results. By 1848, the maternal mortality rates of the two clinics in the Vienna Maternity Hospital were comparable.[ref]More information on this history, the data from the two clinics in Vienna, and references to earlier precursors of Semmelweis (whose work was unknown to him) can be found in Irvine Loudon (1992) ‚Äì Death in Childbirth: An International Study of Maternal Care and Maternal Mortality 1800-1950.

However, Semmelweis's insistence on his discovery that puerperal sepsis was contagious did not fit into the accepted medical understanding of the time, and this meant an agonizingly slow process of convincing the medical establishment of the importance of better hygiene and measures of antisepsis. Only in the second half of the 19th century was antisepsis widely introduced into routine obstetric practice. But this change, coupled with the discovery of antibiotics and the development of blood transfusion in the first half of the 20th century, sharply drove down the risk of dying in childbirth.

Semmelweis's story tells us two things. First, it shows how powerful measurement can be. Decades before the modern germ theory of disease was accepted, and with no understanding of the mechanism that caused puerperal sepsis, it was the measurement of the distribution of maternal deaths that gave Semmelweis the crucial insight about what steps could be taken to effectively reduce maternal mortality. Second, it tells us how frustratingly long it can take until new discoveries become accepted and finally change practices. Semmelweis's discovery, which could have led to immediate and widespread improvements, was not widely circulated. More time would have to pass, with more knowledge accumulated, before steep reductions in maternal mortality could take place.
<h3>Maternal mortality today ‚Äì and where we could be with best practices</h3>
In the chart at the beginning of this article, the short purple line tells us that in 2015 the risk of dying in childbirth stood at 0.216% per birth. Currently, the world sees around 140 million births per year. At the rate of 0.216% this means that globally <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-maternal-deaths?country=OWID_WRL">303,000 mothers will die during child birth this year</a>.

Imagine what it means for loved ones to lose a new mother. Now try to imagine the depth of this devastation 303,000 times over. This is the reality of 2015. The sloping purple line in the chart above tells a story of immense improvement, but it also tells a story that still involves immense tragedy.

The world map below shows the distribution of the risk associated with childbirth today. The global average discussed above hides huge differences in global health. The risk of maternal death is higher than a startling 0.5% in several central African countries.

It is still a very long way down for the countries with the poorest health today. But there is something important and positive to be gleaned from the historical perspective seen here. Finland, the country with the lowest maternal mortality rate today, had a higher mortality rate than today's worst off countries only a few generations ago. Globally, today's maternal mortality rate is similar to that seen in the US in the years after the Second World War. There is no reason to believe that what was possible for Finland and the US should not be possible elsewhere.

We have the advantage of well-established medical and technological knowledge, and this means that today we are capable of reducing maternal mortality at a much faster pace. You can add Tanzania or Cambodia to the first chart above to see how very rapidly some countries have reduced maternal mortality recently.

Given this foundation of knowledge, what can we achieve in the world as a whole? One way to think about this question is to ask how many lives would be saved if the maternal mortality rate of Finland applied to the whole world. The 303,000 annual maternal deaths would be reduced to 4,217. A unique kind of devastation would be avoided nearly 300,000 times.

To a Finnish woman living 150 years ago, today's vastly improved reality would have likely been unimaginable. But a reduction to 0.003% is not unimaginable, it is <em>what we know is possible</em>. Our history and experience should encourage us to believe that much better global health is not only possible, it is also achievable if we continue to rely on good measurement and apply the best scientific understanding of what is causing the deaths of mothers.
