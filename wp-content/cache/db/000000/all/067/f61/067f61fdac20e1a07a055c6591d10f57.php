But what does GDP actually tell us, and why is it increasingly seen as an incomplete and sometimes misleading measure of both economic activity and wellbeing? In this blog post, we answer this question and discuss a ‚Äònew‚Äô, albeit historically older measure which is gaining traction as a much-needed supplement to GDP: national wealth.
<h3>What GDP does and doesn't tell us</h3>
So, what is GDP? GDP is a measure of economic activity ‚Äì in terms of market-based gross output ‚Äì in a given period (often a year). This is of course useful in many ways. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">GDP growth</a>, when captured accurately, has the potential to tell us about the pace of change and rising levels of consumption. Equally, a cessation of GDP growth can serve as an important red flag: stalling enterprises and increases in unemployed workers tend to imply hardship and losses in welfare.

However, there are important changes that GDP does not shed light on, and indeed might give us incorrect signals about. Think about climate change, a critical issue that has been increasingly under the international spotlight. An economy can increase its <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions</a> and drive up <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution/">local pollutants</a> ‚Äì both clearly harmful to the long-term wellbeing of the population ‚Äì while being rewarded with rising GDP figures. Similarly, a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/natural-catastrophes/">natural disaster</a> might harm people, destroy infrastructure, and require expensive emergency measures ‚Äì yet thanks to a rise in spending, this too would temporarily register as an increase in GDP. On the flip side, beneficial endeavors such as attempting to stall the alarming rate of biodiversity loss or deforestation not only fail to register in our headline statistic; they might slow its growth.

This is where wealth accounting comes in. Rather than measuring <em>flows</em>, as GDP does, wealth is an indicator of an economy‚Äôs underlying capital <em>stocks</em>. Wealth, if measured in detail, accounts for the assets such as natural capital, produced capital, and human capital that underpin growth and consumption possibilities, and in this way shows us viable development pathways.[ref]According to the World Bank's definition and calculation of wealth, the underlying assets include: Natural capital (consisting of energy, minerals, agricultural land, protected areas, and forests), produced capital (consisting of machinery, structures, equipment and urban land), human capital (consisting of the knowledge, skills,and experience embodied in the workforce and calculated using the lifetime earnings approach), and net foreign assets (including portfolio equity, debt securities, foreign direct investment, and other financial capital held in other countries). For more details on the methodology, see the <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/dataset_resources/ddhfiles/public/Wealth%20Methodology%20-%20January%2030%2C%202018_4_0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] In the event of a natural disaster or rising <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution/">pollution</a>, for example, while GDP might grow, wealth measures would alert us to the depletion of underlying physical and natural capital stocks and the need for targeted investment. A detailed enough balance sheet would thus theoretically allow for the sustainable management of an economy's productive capital. Therefore, while GDP has little to say about whether a nation‚Äôs assets can sustain current consumption levels into the future, wealth measures can tell us exactly this. The relationship between wealth and GDP is analogous to company accounts: the balance sheet of a company describes the stock of useful assets owned by a company (akin to wealth), while the profit and loss statement describes the flows of revenue, costs, and net income that the company has been able to generate using those assets (akin to GDP). Ultimately, the two measures are necessarily linked and best considered alongside each other.
<h3>Genuine saving: a measure of change in wealth</h3>
With the same logic described above, we can understand that current change to a country‚Äôs total wealth is linked to whether a country‚Äôs future consumption will lie above or below its current consumption level. Genuine saving (also known as ‚Äúadjusted net saving‚Äù or ‚Äúcomprehensive investment‚Äù) provides a measure of the change in wealth. If a country‚Äôs genuine saving is negative, this indicates that the country is consuming more than it is saving, thus eating into its capital stocks. If genuine saving is positive, the country is augmenting its wealth and theoretically improving its future prospects.

It is important, however, to emphasize that this measure of sustainability assumes perfect substitutability among different forms of capital. For example, a country can maintain the same level of genuine saving by depleting natural capital while simultaneously investing in produced capital. Yet this overlooks the fact that some natural capital that is essential to our existence on Earth ‚Äì such as productive soils, a stable climate, and functioning ecosystems ‚Äì face tipping points beyond which they cannot be easily restored. Fittingly, this type of assumption about substitutability underpins a concept often referred to as "weak sustainability". "Strong sustainability", on the other hand, focusses on the fact that natural capital cannot always be substituted for by other forms of capital.

With this important distinction in mind, let us consider existing measures of genuine saving.

Researchers Blum, Ducoing and McLaughlin (2017)[ref]Blum, Ducoing, McLaughlin. ‚ÄúA sustainable century? Genuine savings in developing and developed countries 1900-2000‚Äù in National Wealth: What is Missing, Why it Matters. Eds. Hamilton, K., &amp; Hepburn, C. Oxford University Press.[/ref] provide a view of the long-run development of genuine saving covering eleven countries over the span of the twentieth century. Their definition of genuine savings is as follows: Genuine Savings = net fixed produced capital formation and overseas investment + change in natural capital + education expenditure. Broadly speaking, their measure of saving accounts for changes in wealth in terms of the underlying produced, human, natural, and financial capital.

In the graph below, we see genuine saving plotted alongside GDP for the years 1900-2000 for the UK. You can compare countries by one or both of these measures by clicking "add country" at the bottom of the chart.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/genuine-saving-and-gdp-per-capita-in-international-dollars" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

In the above graph of the UK, we can make out some of the political and social developments of the 20th century reflected statistically. The effects of the Great Depression and Second World War register as dips in genuine saving, while GDP simultaneously grows. This is the case for other early-industrializing countries as well. Adding Switzerland to the chart, however, shows an anomaly ‚Äì as genuine saving declines across most European countries during the two World Wars, Switzerland experienced periods of large saving. This highlights the country's role as a haven for capital.

Interestingly, the time between the Great Depression and World War II also marks the moment in which GDP emerged as the foremost measure of the economy. Although its creators Simon Kuznets and Colin Clark intended to introduce an indicator that would inform us about welfare, wartime pressure took priority. GDP was thus developed as a way to calculate the extent to which people in an economy could be forced to divert efforts into wartime production.[ref]Coyle, D., 2015. GDP: A brief but affectionate history. Princeton University Press.[/ref] In this telling context, Kuznets warned that GDP would fail to make the distinction between the "quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and returns, and between the short and the long term".[ref]Simon Kuznets in: Herbert David Croly eds. (1962) The New Republic Vol. 147. p. 29: About rethinking the system of national accounting[/ref]

In the following chart, we can see a comparison of genuine saving across different countries over the 20th century.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/genuine-savings-per-capita-in-international-dollars-1900-2000" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

What does genuine saving look like in the years after 2000? The researchers responsible for producing the data presented above are currently working on expanding the dataset's country-coverage. In the interim, we can see estimates calculated using a different methodology from the World Bank. The below chart shows the World Bank's measure of Adjusted Net Saving (ANS), also an indicator of genuine saving, for the years 1970 to 2015.

<h3>Total and per capita wealth by asset-type</h3>
Now that we have considered the long-term evolution of <em>changes</em> in wealth, let us consider the latest figures of total and per capita wealth. As mentioned, this is by no means a new idea. As we examine the various forms of capital that make up an economy ‚Äì and which are only just now beginning to garner renewed attention ‚Äì let us keep in mind that wealth has a history longer than that of GDP. Think of Adam Smith's aptly named "The Wealth of Nations", originally published in 1776, and the statistician Robert Giffen, who examined stocks of capital as closely as flows of output in 1889.[ref]Giffen, R. (1889). The growth of capital. London: G. Bell.[/ref] Even the Victorians, who 150 years ago constructed much of the physical capital that we continue to rely upon today, could intuit the lasting impact of capital stocks.

The data visualized below draws on figures just released by the World Bank, who have been at the forefront of developing the methodology and accounting practices behind modern-day wealth accounts. Their newly revised methodology measures wealth from the "bottom-up", calculating the separate value of four asset groups ‚Äì natural capital, produced capital, human capital, and net foreign assets ‚Äì which together account for the majority of national wealth.[ref]The metric is nonetheless an evolving measure, and is not necessarily completely inclusive in its scope at present. Other forms of capital that are not captured but are currently being researched include social and institutional capital as well as ecosystem services.[/ref] Each of these asset groups is measured, where possible, as the net present value of the stream of future returns. This approach intends to capture the lifetime value of an asset, thus allowing us to examine assets, income, and consumption within a framework linking them to future sustainability. The most important improvement to this set of wealth accounts is the inclusion of human capital, calculated as the discounted value of lifetime earnings.

The chart below shows total wealth per capita by country groupings based on income level. We can see that average per capita wealth across the world grew from $130,032 to $169,349 ‚Äì or a rate of 1.3 percent per year ‚Äì between 1995 and 2014. This signals an overall gradually increasing asset base, however it also contains differences in wealth accumulation between rich and poor countries. Over the last twenty years, the concentration of wealth among high income countries fell as middle income countries ‚Äì and most notably upper middle income countries ‚Äì increased their share of global wealth. Low income countries, however, held on to only 1% of global wealth in 2014, about the same share as in 1995.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-wealth-per-capita-by-income-groups-in-2014-us-dollars" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

By breaking down total wealth into its underlying asset groups, we can see that human capital holds the largest share of global wealth in 2014, at 65% of all wealth. Notably, this figure fell from 69% in 1995 ‚Äì a development which the World Bank attributes to the steep decline after 2000 in the shares of human capital in high and upper middle income countries. This decline is in turn a result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">rapidly aging labor forces</a> and slumping real wages (especially in high-income OECD countries). Still, according to the World Bank, human capital is the largest component of wealth in all but low income countries, where the value of natural capital exceeds that of human capital. Among all income groups except high income non-OECD countries, we see that net foreign assets are negative. This implies the role of oil-producers as net creditors to the world.[ref]Forthcoming: World Bank (2018). The Changing Wealth of Nations.[/ref] You can compare the asset breakdown of total wealth for various country groupings by clicking on "change country" in the bottom of the chart.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-wealth-by-asset-group-in-millions-2014-us-dollars" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Some asset groups can be further broken down into sub-components. This is particularly useful for examining natural capital in individual countries ‚Äì and especially so in countries with larger shares of natural capital. A breakdown of natural capital allows us to distinguish between renewable assets such as forests, and non-renewable ones such as fossil fuels. Below we can see that Saudi Arabia is unsurprisingly highly dependent on fossil energy resources.

Notably, natural capital accounts currently fall short of capturing aspects of nature ‚Äì such as biodiversity ‚Äì that have been in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6206/241.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatic decline</a>. To attempt to address this pressing issue, various groups are exploring the <a href="https://www.wavespartnership.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valuation of ecosystem services</a>.

The newly released data from the World Bank is an important step toward statistical measures that shed light on material wellbeing and our ability to sustain it. As wealth gains traction in public thinking ‚Äì it was recently featured in <a href="http://global-perspectives.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/making-the-future-count.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the winning entry of the Indigo Prize</a>, and has been a prominent aspect of other proposals to reform economic measurement[ref]See for example recommendation 3 of the influential Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Report on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress: "Consider income and consumption jointly with wealth" pg. 24, available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/118025/118123/Fitoussi+Commission+report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref] ‚Äì we may hope to see country statistical agencies releasing wealth data alongside GDP data. The implications of such widespread adoption could be big. Focusing on wealth as the primary measure of the economy would mean a complete recasting of the way we determine progress: one that finally shifts away from growth-at-all-costs and pays attention to our future.";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"The missing economic measure: Wealth";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:35:"the-missing-economic-measure-wealth";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-03-26 16:36:55";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-26 15:36:55";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=15663";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16001";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"14";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-03-22 15:00:06";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-22 15:00:06";s:12:"post_content";s:9875:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.</div>
Recently, we published a comprehensive <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">dataset of famine mortality</a> over the last 150 years ‚Äì the outcome of¬†several months' work that brings together a range of sources on particular famines into one place. In this post we show that, despite the uncertainty that surrounds mortality estimates for many individual famines, the overall long-run trend is clear: in recent decades famine mortality rates have fallen abruptly to much lower levels compared to earlier periods. In a¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-far-fewer-people-die-in-famines-today">second blog</a>, we discuss some of the reasons for this decline.
<h3>Victims of individual famines</h3>
The following chart shows¬†the estimated number of people dying in individual famines since the 1860s, based on our dataset which can be found at the bottom of our main entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.¬†The length of each line shows the duration of the famine and the color shows the continent in which the famine occurred.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-number-of-famine-victimes-for-each-famine-revised.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17389" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-number-of-famine-victimes-for-each-famine-revised-750x527.png" alt="" width="750" height="527" /></a>

&nbsp;

What this chart doesn't show however is the significant uncertainty that surrounds many of these estimates. As we discuss in our section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#data-quality-definition">Data Quality</a>, historical famine estimates are frequently based on very scant demographic information, and even where such evidence is available there is still disagreement in its interpretation.

As such, many of the famines included in our dataset are associated with a wide range of plausible mortality estimates. In our data, these are represented by upper- and lower-bound estimates, with the mid-point being shown in the visualization above. Two apt examples, discussed in more detail in the notes at the bottom of this post, are the famines in¬†the Democratic Republic of Congo, which took place amidst the Second Congo War beginning in 1998, and that of North Korea from 1995 to 1999. These famines¬†stand out in recent decades for their particularly high mortality. But in both cases, the range of mortality estimates available in the literature is large, with high and low estimates varying by several millions of deaths.

Where such differences are present, our midpoint estimates are clearly very sensitive to our choice of upper and lower bounds. We have not simply taken the highest and lowest figures published in the public domain, given that more accurate estimates often emerge with time.¬†As noted by the¬†<a href="http://fletcher.tufts.edu/World-Peace-Foundation/Program/Research/Mass-Atrocities-Research-Program/Mass-Famine#Dataset">World Peace Foundation</a>,¬†<em>‚Äúgenerally speaking, better demographic calculations lead to lower estimations of excess deaths than those provided by journalists and other contemporary observers."¬†</em>Rather, we have sought to select upper and lower estimates based on the¬†balance of opinion in commonly-cited sources, all of which are detailed (for each individual event) in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">dataset of famines</a>. Inevitably though, this meant us taking a position in some controversial cases, discussed in detail¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#some-controversial-mortality-estimates">here</a>.

&nbsp;
<h3>Long term trend in global famine mortality</h3>
Whilst the number of deaths caused by individual famines is often subject to a good deal of uncertainty, the overall trend over time is very clear: compared to earlier historical periods, far fewer people have died in famines in recent decades. Whether we consider high or low¬†estimates, or something in between, does not affect this conclusion. Relative to the growing world population this trend is all the more notable. Below we show the rate of famine deaths globally, expressed as the number of people dying each year per 100,000 people of the world population, again based on our midpoint estimates for each famine. The chart presents this rate averaged across each decade since 1860. You can see that the famine mortality rate fell to very low levels over the second half of the 20th century onwards.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famine-death-rate-since-1860s-revised.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17387" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famine-death-rate-since-1860s-revised-750x527.png" alt="" width="750" height="527" /></a>
The geographic spread of famines has also reduced over this period, as we can see in the chart below. While in earlier periods Asia suffered heavily from major famines, this came to a halt over the mid-20th century. Since then, famines have almost exclusively been restricted to Africa, with the famine in North Korea being a stark exception.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famines-by-continent-and-ME-01.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17443" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Famines-by-continent-and-ME-01-500x550.png" alt="" width="613" height="674" /></a>

&nbsp;

The sharp reduction in famine mortality represents "one of the¬†great unacknowledged triumphs of our lifetime", as famine researcher, Alex de Waal describes it.[ref]de Waal, A., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.09.004">The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action</a>, Political Geography (2017)[/ref] A¬†continued decline, however, is far from assured. As we consider in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-far-fewer-people-die-in-famines-today">second blog</a> though, the long-run developments that have contributed to the sharp decline in famine mortality do suggest that the type of catastrophic famine seen in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is unlikely to return.

The great disparity between these two estimates largely lies within the assumptions made about the number of people that would have died anyway in the absence of the Second Congo War, with the Human Security Report arguing that the IRC estimate adopts an overly optimistic counterfactual. So called 'excess mortality' estimates are always highly sensitive to the choice of baseline mortality rate, but this is particularly true for crises that extend across several years such that the counterfactual <em>trend</em> in mortality has to be considered also. They also argue that the survey data on which the IRC estimate is based is, for some periods at least, unrepresentative of the country as a whole ‚Äì a perennial issue in famine demography, given the typically patchy availability of data.

<strong>North Korea, 1995-1999</strong>

<em>Upper-bound mortality estimate: 240,000 ‚Äì </em><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00475.x/full/"><em>Spoorenberg and Schwekendiek (2012)</em></a>

The number of people that died in the North Korean famine remains highly uncertain, largely due to the closed nature of the country. This has precluded access to official data and other channels of inquiry, such as surveys. Estimates range from the North Korean Government's 'quasi-official' estimate of 220,000 to the 3.5 million arrived at by South Korean NGO, <a href="http://goodfriends.or.kr/eng/">Good Friends Centre for Peace, Human Rights and Refugees</a>¬†by extrapolating from interviews conducted with refugees fleeing the country.

More recent analyses have produced increasingly lower estimates, with a rough consensus that the sample of refugees upon which the 3.5 million figure was based¬†‚Äì people from areas so badly affected that they sought to emigrate ‚Äì was almost certainly unrepresentative of the country as a whole.[ref]See, for instance √ì Gr√°da <em>Famine: A Short History¬†</em>(2009), p.94 and <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/Hunger_and_Human_Rights.pdf">Haggard and Noland (2005)</a>.[/ref]¬†Both our upper and lower estimates are, instead, based on the authors' attempts to reconstruct demographic trends between censuses conducted in 1993 and 2008, again contrasted to an assumed counterfactual mortality rate.[ref]¬†Ho Il Moon's estimate of 336,000 published in <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/how-big-north-korean-army-evidence-missing-population">a recent article for VOX</a>, also falls in this interval.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famine</a>.</div>
In recent years, specific criteria have been agreed upon by the international humanitarian community for determining if a food crisis should be considered a <a href="https://owid.cloud/famines/">famine</a>. But given the range and complexity of food emergencies, the way in which famines, or potential famines, are discussed can still be quite unclear. In this post I look at two potentially confusing recent examples and, by considering in more detail how famines are classified, I try to clarify what's going on.
<h3>Famine in South Sudan in 2017</h3>
In February 2017, parts of South Sudan were officially declared by the UN as being in famine ‚Äì the first such declaration since 2011. By May the famine had apparently receded, thanks to an effective aid response that averted large-scale loss of life. And yet, the crisis was far from over. Indeed the overall food security situation in the country had, in fact, 'further deteriorated'¬†over the same period, according to official reports[ref]IPC May 2017 communication, available <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_South_Sudan_AcuteFI_May2017_June-July2017.pdf">here</a>. Access 22 Jan 2018.[/ref]¬†‚Äì even as the 'famine' status was being withdrawn. Since then the situation has barely improved, with some 4.8 million people (45% of the population) expected to be severely food insecure as compared to 5.5 million back in May 2017.[ref]Comparing the the figure given in the IPC May communication with the <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-detail-forms/ipcinfo-map-detail/en/c/1052776/">September 2017 Key Messages</a> report, accessed 22 Jan 2018.[/ref]

So is the famine in South Sudan over or not?
<h3>'Largest humanitarian crisis' since 1945</h3>
Then in March 2017, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stephen O'Brian, stated that the combined emergencies in South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria represented the 'largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN', with some 20 million people being 'at risk of starvation'.[ref]The statement was made at the <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12748.doc.htm">7897th UN Security Council briefin</a>g. Article accessed 21 Jan 2018.[/ref]

The chart below shows the estimated number of people dying in individual famines since 1860 and provides some context for this statement. It¬†is based on the table found at the end of our recently updated entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.¬†The color of the line shows the continent in which the famine occurred. We can see that, were a mortality of the order of 20 million deaths to materialize, it would, as a combined figure, indeed rank as one of the most catastrophic famines in history, second only to the 'Great Leap Forward famine' in China in 1959-61.

But we also see that, since the second half of the twentieth century, catastrophic famines¬†‚Äì with mortalities in the millions¬†‚Äì have been much less frequent compared to earlier periods.[ref]The 'catastrophic' category comes from<em>¬†Howe, P. &amp; Devereux, S. 2004. Famine intensity and magnitude scales: A proposal for an instrumental definition of famine. Disasters 28(4), 353‚Äì372.</em>

It should be noted that the mortality estimate for the famine in the Democratic Republic of Congo around the turn of the millennium is somewhat controversial, with estimates ranging from under one million to over five million deaths. See the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#some-controversial-mortality-estimates">Data Quality</a> section of the full entry on famines for more detail.[/ref] There are many contributing factors that explain the reduced number of famine casualties (discussed more in our entry on¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>), but most represent long-term trends, such as <a href="https://owid.cloud/health-meta/">improvements in public health</a>, access to markets and transport infrastructure. Taken together, they have reduced the structural vulnerability of populations to the kinds of mortality rates witnessed in earlier famines. As such, famine scholar Alex de Waal writes, <em>"even if all four countries [‚Äì South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria ‚Äì] do become famine-stricken, it is still very unlikely that levels of mortality will approach those in the calamitous famines of the mid-twentieth century."</em>[ref]deWaal, A., The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action, Political Geography (2017)[/ref]

The humanitarian crisis is, nonetheless,¬†very real. But how should we understand the gravity of the present situation in the context of the past?

<h3>A closer look</h3>
In order to approach this question, and to get a better understanding of the crisis in South Sudan, it is helpful to look more closely at how different degrees of food insecurity, including famine, are categorized today.

<strong>Intensity vs. Magnitude</strong>

In declaring famines, the UN follows the <em>Integrated Food Security Phase Classification</em> (IPC) ‚Äì you find all details in the¬†IPC guidelines <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Guidelines_Nov16.pdf">here</a>, and the more general¬†<a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>.

The IPC lays out thresholds across three dimensions of outcomes, all of which must be evidenced in order for a famine to be declared in a certain area:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Food consumption and livelihood change:</strong> At least one in five households¬†faces an extreme lack of food, as evidenced by insufficient food consumption (in terms of quantity and/or quality) and by the coping strategies employed by or available to households (e.g. the extent to which assets like livestock or seed may have been sold off)</li>
 	<li><strong>Nutritional status:¬†</strong>More than 30% of the population is suffering from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#too-little-weight-for-height-wasting">'wasting'</a> (being below 2 standard deviations below the median weight for a given height in the reference population)</li>
 	<li><strong>M</strong><strong>or</strong><strong>tality (due to inadequate food consumption)</strong>[ref]The <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>¬†states that <em>"for both nutrition and mortality area outcomes, household food consumption deficits must be an explanatory factor in order for that evidence to be used in support of a Phase classification"</em>. Where, for instance, illness or conflict, unrelated to food consumption deficits, was the cause of mortality this should not be included in the Phase assessment. However, it is common for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#poor-health-and-infectious-diseases">poor health</a> or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#war-and-famines">conflict</a> to exacerbate the extent or impact of food consumption deficits. Mortality generated in such circumstance is counted.[/ref]<strong>:</strong> At least two people out of¬†every 10,000¬†and at least four children under five out of every 10,000 are dying per day.[ref]The key criterion is for the overall death rate to be above the 2/10,000 threshold. Where this is below the threshold level but the under five death rate is above its threshold, famine should only be declared following consultation with an 'Emergency Review Committee'. See IPC guidelines <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Famine_Guidelines_Nov16.pdf">here</a>, and the more general¬†<a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>, accessed 26 Jan 2018.[/ref]</li>
</ul>
A few things are worth noting about this definition. Firstly, these thresholds represent only the most severe rank of the IPC food insecurity classification. The system ranges from Phase 1 to Phase 5, with 5 corresponding to a famine situation. Lower phases of food insecurity are categorized by lower thresholds in each of the three dimensions above.

Secondly, it is important to see that such thresholds are a measure of¬†<em>intensity¬†</em>rather than¬†<em>magnitude</em>[ref]This distinction in famine classification was made in an influential paper by Paul Howe and Steven Devereux in 2004, see<em> Howe, P. &amp; Devereux, S. 2004. Famine intensity and magnitude scales: A proposal for an instrumental definition of famine. Disasters 28(4), 353‚Äì372.</em>[/ref]<em>.</em>¬†That is to say, rather than trying to capture the absolute number of people in a certain situation of food insecurity, it looks at proportions within given geographic areas. Thus different assessments of food security trends will often be made depending on the geographic level of analysis. An amelioration at a very local level is perfectly compatible with an overall deterioration of the food security status of a country as whole. And this is exactly what happened in South Sudan over the course of 2017.

The first map below shows the IPC classification of each county of South Sudan in January 2017. It was the intensity of the food security situation in Unity State (in dark red colors), which brought about the famine declaration later in February, with IPC Phase 5 thresholds being confirmed in some parts.

In the second map below we can see that by May the situation in Unity State had somewhat abated¬†due to humanitarian relief efforts, but the food security situation of most other parts of the country had deteriorated significantly. Thus while the 'famine' was over¬†<em>‚Äì</em> in the very particular sense of there being no area where intensity thresholds met Phase 5 criteria¬†¬†<em>‚Äì </em>the food emergency had in fact become worse for most people.

<strong>Areas as a whole vs. individual households within an area</strong>

Just as different parts of a country can have different food security statuses, different households can, and typically do, experience different levels of food insecurity within any given geographic area. Rather than looking at geographical subdivisions, one way of getting a sense of how different people are faring in a food emergency is to look at the numbers of individual households experiencing different levels of food insecurity.

The IPC sets out such a 'Household Group Classification' alongside the 'Area Classification' outlined above. It mirrors the area classification in providing a Phase classification from 1 to 5, with 5 consisting of a 'Catastrophe' situation for the household. Since nutritional status and mortality data are typically collected for whole populations in a given area, only the food consumption and livelihood change dimension is used to categorize food security at the household level¬†‚Äì though signs of malnutrition or excess mortality within the household are used to confirm the presence of extreme food gaps at the higher insecurity rankings.[ref]The two classifications are linked by the fact that the categorization of households along this dimension forms the basis of the first threshold criterion of the area classification of food insecurity:¬†<em>"A key criterion for¬†</em><em>the Area classification is that 20 percent of the population must be in that Phase or worse based on¬†</em><em>the Household Group classification".</em>[/ref]

So whilst the household-level classification considers fewer outcomes (only food deficits, as opposed to nutritional or mortality outcomes), it does allow for an assessment of the magnitude of a food emergency in terms of the absolute number of people being affected at different levels of severity. Looking at the household data for South Sudan over 2017 offers another angle on the evolution of the crisis. The two tables give the number of people estimated to be at a given level of insecurity across the different States in January (first table) and May (second table).

With such a disaggregation we can see that the humanitarian provision, targeted to the most in need in Unity State, did indeed bring down the number of people experiencing the very worst food insecurity. It was on this basis that that country was no longer officially 'in famine'. However, if we look at the number of individuals in Phase 3 (Crisis) or worse food insecurity, we see not only a deterioration in the country as a whole (45.2 % of the population in May compared to 32.3% in January), but even in Unity State itself (with 58.7% and 54.7% respectively).

Thus whilst a binary 'famine/no-famine' categorization is very useful in terms of being able to draw international attention and relief efforts to the most dire situations, there are other dimensions that we should be aware of in trying to get a sense of the gravity of a food crisis, particularly in terms of its magnitude.

<strong>Global outlook</strong>

The Household Group IPC classification can be used to get a sense of the sense of the scale of the food emergencies currently underway. The <a href="http://www.fews.net">Famine Early Warning Systems Network</a>¬†(FEWS), for instance, publishes estimates for the number of people in need of emergency food assistance, defined as those experiencing, or imminently likely to experience Phase 3 ('Crisis') food insecurity or worse. This corresponds to households experiencing <em>"food consumption gaps with high or above usual acute malnutrition"</em> or those¬†<em>"marginally able to meet minimum food needs only with accelerated depletion of livelihood assets that will lead to food consumption gaps."¬†</em>

And along this dimension, the numbers are, according to <a href="http://www.fews.net/global/alert/january-25-2017">FEWS</a>, 'unprecedented in recent decades'.[ref]See article <a href="http://www.fews.net/global/alert/january-25-2017">here</a>, accessed 27 Jan 2018. FEWS in fact later went on to increase its estimates for 2017 to 83 million, as shown in the bar chart.[/ref]

It is in this context that we should probably interpret Stephen O'Brien's statement last year that the world was facing the 'largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN'. The numbers estimated to be in need of emergency assistance in 2017, as defined by FEWS, did represent a peak in recent times[ref]This is based on FEWS' statement just cited. I was not able to find figures prior to 2015. It is important to note that the coverage of the FEWS analysis is not global, and the geographical coverage can change from year to year. The system looks at only those countries considered to be at risk of facing food crises. As such it may not capture some households experiencing similar levels of food insecurity in countries that are not within this scope.[/ref] ‚Äì and humanitarian needs are set to remain high in 2018. Largely due to ongoing conflicts, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria and, again, South Sudan all face a credible risk of famine during 2018 according to <a href="http://www.fews.net/global/alert/november-28-2017">FEWS</a>.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Total_IPC3_plus.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16331 size-large" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Total_IPC3_plus-750x545.png" alt="" width="750" height="545" /></a>

<strong>Prospective vs. retrospective classification</strong>

The IPC system is fundamentally geared towards <em>preventing¬†</em>famines, rather than assessing their severity after the event. As stated in the <a href="http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/IPC-Manual-2-Interactive.pdf">IPC Manual</a>,

<em>"The purpose of the IPC... is not to classify various degrees of famine, nor is it to categorize the ‚Äúworst famine‚Äù. Rather, in order to inform real-time decision-making, the IPC thresholds for famine...¬†are set to signify the beginning of famine stages."</em>

It is important to bear this in mind when trying to compare such assessments with famine trends over time. Our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">table of famine mortality since 1860</a>, on which the first chart in this post is based, provides estimates of the 'excess mortality' associated to individual famines.[ref] That is to say, the number of deaths in addition to that which would have been expected in the famine's absence. It should be borne in mind that many of the estimates in our table, particularly those from earlier periods, are not based on detailed demographic data but rather represent a certain degree of guesswork on the part of either contemporary observers or historians. For more discussion, see the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#data-quality-definition">Data Quality</a> section of our entry. [/ref] In reference to the discussion above, this can be thought of as a measure of magnitude only along one dimension, mortality.

Official famine declarations based on the IPC Area classification, like that made for South Sudan last year, do not straightforwardly map on to such an analysis. For instance, given the larger population being affected, it is quite possible that more people have died due to food consumption deficits since early 2017 in Yemen than in South Sudan, despite the intensity of the crisis not having met famine thresholds in any part of the country so far. We are not aware of any mortality estimates for the crisis in South Sudan or Yemen currently.[ref]However, late in 2017¬†<a href="https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/yemen--hunger---disease-could-kill-at-least-50-000-children-this">Save the Children</a> predicted that child mortalities would go on to reach 50,000 by the end of that year. Accessed 31 Jan 2018.[/ref]

In terms of classification based on excess mortality alone, there are no officially-agreed criteria about which food emergencies should be counted as famines and which not. In collating our table of famine mortality we¬†excluded events with an estimated mortality of less than one thousand.[ref]Note that we have made use of a number of different sources and have thereby implicitly accepted the underlying definitions of famine held by observers and historians over time. It is likely that some events that today would be considered famines may not have been seen as such in the past and will therefore be missing from our table.¬†[/ref] Currently our data do not include any mortality estimates for the ongoing crises in South Sudan, Yemen and elsewhere, but it now seems likely that in some cases, as mortality estimates emerge, their inclusion will be warranted.

Whether or not this will represent a reversal of the historical trend of decreasing famine mortality is as yet unknown and will largely depend upon how the conflicts driving the most acute food insecurity situations today will develop.";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"What does a famine declaration declare?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:38:"what-does-a-famine-declaration-declare";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-03-12 10:11:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-12 10:11:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=16016";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16370";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"22";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-03-05 13:41:31";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-05 13:41:31";s:12:"post_content";s:10240:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Extreme Poverty</a></strong>.</div>

According to the International Poverty Line, people are considered to be in 'extreme poverty' if they live on less than $1.90 per day, or the equivalent amount after converting currencies and adjusting for price differences between countries. This is the definition used by the World Bank and many other international institutions.

Clearly, $1.90 is a <em>very</em> low threshold, so extreme poverty is, well, extreme.

It is very important that fewer people live in such extreme misery, and thankfully that has happened. Today, about 10% of the world population lives in extreme poverty, while in 1990 the corresponding figure was about 37%. Two centuries ago <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-home-production-and-consumption">almost everyone in the world lived in extreme poverty</a>.

But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't care about what is happening relative to higher poverty lines. The evidence shows that there is a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#what-do-poor-people-think-about-poverty">clear and continuous relationship between material deprivation and subjective well-being</a>, so it would be wrong to celebrate shifting daily incomes from $1.89 to $1.91, even if this shift technically means abruptly reducing extreme poverty. People living on $3, $5, or $10 per day also face substantial hardships, and are still living in poverty.

So, how has poverty changed relative to these higher thresholds?

The short answer is that global poverty rates have also been falling above the $1.90 line. This means that, although much still needs to be done, progress has been real. The historical reductions in global extreme poverty are not merely the result of people moving marginally above some arbitrary misery threshold.

Let's take a closer look at the evidence.
<h3>Data: source and limitations</h3>
<a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povDuplicateWB.aspx">PovcalNet</a> is a database of consumption and income distributions from all over the world. It is produced and maintained by the World Bank, and it is the most important source of cross-country data to measure poverty.

The main purpose of PovcalNet is to measure global poverty, and accordingly, there are some limitations that follow from the way they produce their data. Importantly: (i) for all countries the top tails of the distributions are unreliable; and (ii) estimates of extreme poverty in rich countries, where PovcalNet uses data from income rather than consumption surveys, are not accurate nor comparable to those in poorer countries.[ref] In the documentation, the source writes: "PovcalNet was developed for the sole purpose of public replication of the World Bank‚Äôs poverty measures for its widely used international poverty lines, including $1.90 a day and $3.20 a day in 2011 PPP. The methods built into PovcalNet are considered reliable for that purpose. However, we cannot be confident that the methods work well for other purposes, including tracing out the entire distribution of income. We would especially warn that estimates of the densities near the bottom and top tails of the distribution could be quite unreliable, and no attempt has been made by the Bank‚Äôs staff to validate the tool for such purposes."[/ref]

Because of these limitations, <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/chart-week-4-angus-deaton-location-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we can't really use PovcalNet to study extreme poverty in rich countries</a>, just as we can't use it to study the incomes of very rich people in any given country.

But we can use it to explore how incomes below, say, 10 dollars per day are changing for most people in the world.
<h3>Global poverty</h3>
The visualisation below uses PovcalNet data to show the distribution of the world population across different poverty thresholds. This shows a fantastic achievement: Independently of which of the shown thresholds you think should be the appropriate poverty line, the result is the same. The global poverty rate has been falling across all these poverty lines. Indeed,¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/no-matter-what-global-poverty-line">the share of people below any poverty line has declined globally</a> in recent years.

As we can see, more progress has been achieved for the three lowest lines. And this takes us to another important observation: Today, almost two-thirds of the world population live below 10 dollars per day. This explains why, if we want to focus on those who are worst off, we need to use fairly low poverty lines, such as the $1.90 and $3.10 lines employed by the World Bank.[ref]In some reports (e.g. this from the <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/07/08/a-global-middle-class-is-more-promise-than-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pew Research Center</a>), the segment between $3.10 and $10 is referred to as 'low income' rather than 'poverty'. In fact, as our chart shows, if you rank the world population by income today, and split them into three groups of equal size, you will find that the middle group is defined by the bracket $3.10-$10. So people in this bracket could also be considered 'middle income'. [/ref]

The next visualization shows the number, rather than the share, of people between the different poverty thresholds. (You can always switch between this and the previous chart by clicking on the visualization and toggling the button labelled 'relative'.)

Again, this is an encouraging picture. For more than a decade, the <em> number </em> of people living under the three lowest poverty lines has been on the decline. So, independently of which of these poverty lines you choose, not only have poverty rates declined, but the total number of people living in poverty has also fallen.

Obviously, there is still much work to be done. Even 10 dollars per day provides a very low standard of living. But the key message here is that the incomes of those at the bottom are increasing.

<h3>Understanding progress and challenges, country by country</h3>
The charts above give us an idea of how global poverty is changing. Yet the fortunes of people around the world have changed very differently depending on where they live.

Here, again, we can use PovcalNet's data to explore the evolution of poverty for particular countries and regions. Below we discuss some countries we found interesting, but you can do your own analysis by clicking on any visualization and selecting the option 'change country' at the bottom of the chart.

<strong>China</strong>

The case of China is remarkable. As the chart below shows, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of people living in extreme poverty, while at the same time there has been an increase in the number of people living on incomes above $10 a day.

If you switch to the 'relative' view, you see that poverty rates have been going down for all of the included poverty lines. In 1981, the entire Chinese population lived below $3.10. Today less than 12% of the population live below this threshold.

If you compare China and India, for example, you can see that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-per-capita-household-consumption?stackMode=relative&amp;country=IND">while Indians have also made substantial progress, they have seen a slower reduction in poverty, especially at higher thresholds</a>.¬†The case of China is special, but it would be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/the-global-decline-of-extreme-poverty-was-it-only-china">wrong to assume that extreme poverty in the world fell 'only' because of China</a>.

<strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>

Relative to the global average, Sub-Saharan Africa has made much slower progress in reducing poverty. And this is, unfortunately, especially true at higher poverty thresholds.

As the chart below shows, the total number of people living in extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa has been fairly constant in recent years, and it remains higher than it was in 1981. Above extreme poverty, if we look at the $3.10 line, we see that the increase in the number of poor people is even more pronounced.

However, in relative terms, poverty trends in Sub-Saharan Africa are slightly more encouraging: The share of people living below $3.10 has been falling.

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
Measuring poverty is difficult because it requires making a sharp distinction between those who are and aren't considered poor. So when we see that global extreme poverty is going down, it is natural to ask ourselves: Are these reductions produced by a definition of ‚Äòextreme‚Äô poverty which is too low?

The evidence discussed above shows that this is not the case. The global poverty rate has been going down in recent years, and this is true independently of whether we set the poverty line at 1.90 or 10 dollars per day.

Of course, high levels of deprivation are unfortunately still very common in most countries, and in many parts of the world we are not making progress. But what is clear is that it is very much possible to reduce poverty.";s:10:"post_title";s:77:"Extreme poverty is falling: How is poverty changing for higher poverty lines?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:79:"extreme-poverty-is-extreme-how-is-non-extreme-poverty-changing-around-the-world";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-04-03 13:13:03";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-04-03 12:13:03";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=16370";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16619";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"14";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-04-03 09:30:54";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-04-03 08:30:54";s:12:"post_content";s:17111:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.</div>
This post is the first of a pair of posts looking the relationship between famines and population growth. Here we consider whether population growth causes famine and hunger. In a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/do-famines-check-population-growth">second post</a>, we look at the demographic impacts of famines, and in particular the extent to which famines may 'check' population growth.
<h3>Modern Malthusians</h3>
<em>It‚Äôs no good blaming climate change or food shortages or political corruption. Sorry to be neo-Malthusian about it, but <strong>continuing population growth in this region makes periodic famine unavoidable</strong> ‚Äì as many people have been pointing out since the last famine. Many of the children saved by the money raised over the next few weeks will inevitably be back again in similar feeding¬†centres¬†with their own¬†children in a few years time.</em>
<p style="text-align: right;">- Blog entry from British environmentalist, Sir Jonathan Porrit, 11/07/2011[ref]<a href="http://www.jonathonporritt.com/blog/who-would-have-thought-it-population-growth-and-famine-would-appear-be-linked">Who would have thought it? Population growth and famine would appear to be linked!</a> Blog entry from www.jonathanporritt.com, dated¬†11/07/2011. Accessed 19 Jan 2018. Emphasis added.[/ref]</p>
It is not uncommon to see arguments along the lines of this quote from¬†Sir Jonathan Porritt, claiming that famines are ultimately caused by overpopulation.¬†Porritt ‚Äì former director of 'Friends of the Earth' and also former chairman of the UK Government‚Äôs Sustainable Development Commission¬†‚Äì was talking about the 2011 famine¬†in Somalia that went on to kill roughly 250,000 people[ref]The excess mortality estimate is taken from the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/">World Peace Foundation</a> list of famines.[/ref]. He seems certain that the rapid population growth witnessed in East Africa had made famine there ‚Äòunavoidable‚Äô.

There is something compelling about this logic: a finite land area, with a limited ‚Äòcarrying capacity‚Äô, cannot continue to feed a growing population indefinitely.¬†From such a perspective, the provision of humanitarian aid to famine-afflicted countries, however well intended, represents only a temporary fix. In this view it fails to address the fundamental issue: there simply being too many mouths to feed.

As mentioned in the quote, this suggestion is commonly associated with the name of Thomas Robert Malthus, the English political economist writing at the turn of the nineteenth century. Malthus is famous for the assertion that in the absence of ‚Äòpreventative checks‚Äô to reduce <em>birth</em> rates, the natural tendency for populations to increase ‚Äì being ‚Äòso superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man‚Äô ‚Äì ultimately results in ‚Äòpositive checks‚Äô that increase the <em>death</em> rate. If all else fails to curb population, <em>‚Äògigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world'</em>.[ref] Malthus T.R. 1798.¬†<em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. Chapter VII, p 44.[/ref]

But does the evidence support this idea? Here we look into the relationship between population growth and famine, as well as that between population growth and hunger more generally.
<h3>Does population growth cause famine?</h3>
For our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a> we produced a dataset of the estimated number of deaths from all famines worldwide since the 1860s. The chart below compares the number of deaths per decade with the total world population over the same period.

Looking at the world as whole, it is very difficult to square Malthus' hypothesis with the simple but stark fact that, despite the world population increasing from less than one billion in 1800 to more than seven billion today, the number of people dying due to famine in recent decades is only a tiny fraction of that in previous eras.
<h6>Famine victims by decade and world population, 1860s-2010s</h6>
<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Famine-victims-and-world-population-since-1860.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17425" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Famine-victims-and-world-population-since-1860-750x512.png" alt="" width="750" height="512" /></a>
We might naturally think that the explanation for this trend lies in increasing agricultural production. Indeed,¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person">food supply per person</a>¬†has consistently increased in recent decades, the large increase in global population being met with an even greater increase in food supply (largely due to increases in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture">yields per hectare</a>).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-supply-by-region-in-kilocalories-per-person-per-day-1961-2013" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

However, looking at the issue in this way is too simple. As we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>, insufficient aggregate food supply per person is just one factor that can bring about famine mortality. Contemporary famine scholarship tends to suggest that insufficient aggregate food supply is less important than one might think, and instead emphasises the role of public policy and violence: in most famines of the 20th and 21st centuries, conflict, political oppression, corruption, or gross economic mismanagement on the part of dictatorships or colonial regimes played a key role.[ref]See, for instance, de Waal, A. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629817302871#!">The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action</a>, <em>Political Geography</em>, 62:2008[/ref] The same also applies for the most acutely food-insecure countries today.[ref]The threat of famine in Yemen, South Sudan and Nigeria are all the direct consequence of conflict, and the drought in Somalia arrives after decades of conflict and political instability. See <a href="http://www.fews.net/">FEWS.net</a> for more details.[/ref] It is also true of the 2011 famine in Somalia referred to above, in which food aid was greatly restricted, and in some cases diverted, by militant Islamist group al Shabaab¬†and other armed opposition groups in the country.[ref]¬†Seal, A., &amp; Bailey, R. (2013). The 2011 Famine in Somalia: lessons learnt from a failed response? <i>Conflict and Health</i>, <i>7</i>, 22. http://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1505-7-22. As the authors note, this was in part due to concern on the part of humanitarian organisations that they would be contravening US government sanctions. Furthermore, both the US and the EU had significantly reduced humanitarian spending in the country in the run up to the famine.[/ref]

Famine scholar Stephen Devereux of the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, summarizes the trajectory of famines over the 20th century as follows:¬†<em>"The achievement of a global capacity to guarantee food security was accompanied by a simultaneous expansion of the capacity of governments to inflict lethal policies, including genocidal policies often involving the extraction of food from the poor and denial of food to the starving."</em>[ref]Devereux, S.<a href="https://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf"><em> Famine in the Twentieth Century. </em></a>IDS working paper 105, 2000.[/ref]

Thus, all in all, the recent history of famine mortality does not fit the Malthusian narrative particularly well. Firstly, contrary to what Malthus predicted for rapidly increasing populations, food supply per person has¬†‚Äì in all regions ‚Äì increased as populations have grown. Secondly, famines have not become more, but less frequent. Thirdly, in the modern era the occurrence of major famine mortality, and its prevention, is something for which politics and policy seem the more salient triggers.
<h3>Does population growth increase hunger?</h3>
Famines tend to be thought of as acute periods of crisis, and are in that sense to be distinguished from more chronic manifestations of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">hunger</a> that may in some places represent 'normal' circumstances, despite being responsible for large numbers of deaths.[ref]de Waal, 2018 defines famine as '<em>a crisis of mass hunger that causes elevated mortality over a specific period of time'</em>. Note that the official <a href="http://www.ipcinfo.org/">IPC classification system</a> used by the UN for famine declarations just looks at total (undernourishment-related) death rates in absolute terms, rather than relative to any non-crisis reference level. This contrasts somewhat to the typical ex-ante famine assessment in which <em>excess</em> mortality is estimated by factoring out the counterfactual death rate¬†‚Äì however high.[/ref] Given the typically political nature of outbreaks of such famine crises, it may make more sense to look for an effect of population growth on the longer-term trends of hunger and malnutrition.

But again, at the global level, we know that population growth has been accompanied by a downward trend in hunger. As we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">Hunger and Undernourishment</a>, in recent decades the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-undernourishment?tab=chart">proportion of undernourished people in the world has fallen</a>, and, although more muted, this fall is also seen in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-population-defined-as-undernourished">absolute number</a>. The number of people dying globally due to insufficient calorie or protein intake has also fallen, from almost half a million in the 1990s to roughly 300,000 in the most recent data,¬†as shown in the visualisation below.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malnutrition-deaths-by-age" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;

We can also look at the experiences of individual countries, rather than just at the global level. Do those countries with particularly high population growth rates find it harder to adequately feed its population?

In order to get some idea¬†about this, we can compare countries'¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#the-global-hunger-index-ghi">Global Hunger Index</a>¬†(GHI) score with their population growth rates. GHI is a composite measure, out of 100, that combines four indicators: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">undernourishment</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#too-little-weight-for-height-wasting">child wasting</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-of-children">child stunting</a>, and <a href="https://owid.cloud/child-mortality/">child mortality</a>.[ref]More information on these individual indicators, including their definitions, can be found on our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment">Hunger and Undernourishment</a>.[/ref] The first scoring was conducted in 1992, and was then repeated every eight years with the most recent being in carried out in 2017. The score is based on data collected in the years leading up to the scoring year, and as such reflect the hunger levels in this period rather than solely capturing conditions in the year itself. The graphs below show all the countries for which there was GHI data available between 1992 and 2017.[ref]Population data was taken from the World Bank for 1992 to 2016. Note that GHI is typically not collected for wealthy countries. Below a score of 5, GHI gets bottom coded as '&lt;5'. Of the 95 countries for which we have data in both years, none of them began bottom coded but five moved into this range by 2017. In the analysis that follows we replaced these bottom-coded observations with a GHI of 2.5. However the key results are robust to omitting these countries altogether. As a robustness check, we also conducted the analysis on the prevalence of undernourishment separately (one of the four components of GHI). The key results remained unchanged.[/ref] Crucially, <em>this excludes a number of very food-insecure countries</em>¬†including the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and¬†Somalia, which have also seen high levels of population growth.[ref]These three countries would be situated in the top quarter of our sample in terms of population growth, with DRC and South Sudan roughly in the top decile.[/ref] This should be borne in mind when interpreting the following results.

Of the countries for which we do have GHI data, it is clear that those with higher levels of hunger have also tended to have had higher population growth over the last 25 years.[ref]Statistically significant at the 1% level, even when controlling for GDP per capita in 2016 (using World Bank PPP data)[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/global-hunger-index-in-2017-vs-population-growth-1992-2015-un-population-division" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;

It is important to see though that among the countries for which we have GHI scores in both 1992 and 2017, the level of hunger went down in all but one (Iraq). Over the same period population went up in almost every case. Moreover, those countries that experienced higher levels of population growth in fact saw a¬†<em>bigger</em>¬†drop in their GHI score over this period.[ref]This relationship is significant at the 1% level. The relationship is stronger (both in magnitude and significance) controlling for GDP per capita (using World Bank PPP data)[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/change-in-global-hunger-index-1992-2017-global-hunger-index-2017-vs-population-growth-1992-2015-un-population-division" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

The countries that saw high population growth over this period started with higher levels of hunger in 1992. So what we are seeing here is that countries are¬†<em>converging </em>towards lower levels of hunger: it fell quickest in countries with the highest levels of hunger, as we can see in the chart below.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/change-in-global-hunger-index-1992-2017-vs-global-hunger-index-in-1992" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;

So whilst countries that experience hunger do tend to have high levels of population growth, the idea that population growth necessarily leads to¬†<em>increased</em>¬†hunger is clearly mistaken: many countries with high population growth have recently managed to decrease levels of hunger substantially.
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
Environmental degradation, including climate change,¬†<a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6030e.pdf">does pose a threat to food security</a>, and the growth of human populations has undoubtedly exacerbated many environmental pressures. However, this represents only one aspect of the complex explanation of why so many people suffer and die from undernourishment today, despite their being adequate food available for consumption globally.[ref]World food supply per person is higher than the Average Dietary Energy Requirements of all countries. See our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person">Food per Person</a> for more details.[/ref]

'Malthusian' explanations of famine and hunger thus fall short for the following reasons, the evidence for which we reviewed above:
<ul>
 	<li>Per capita food supply has increased as populations have grown, largely due to increasing yields.</li>
 	<li>Famine deaths have decreased, not increased, with population growth.</li>
 	<li>Food scarcity has played a smaller role in famines than suggested by the Malthusian narrative.¬†It ignores other factors like conflict, poverty, access to markets,¬†healthcare systems, and political institutions.</li>
 	<li>Population growth is high where hunger is high, but that does not mean that population growth makes hunger inevitable. On the contrary, we see that hunger has fallen fastest in countries with high population growth.</li>
</ul>
If we want to put an end to hunger, we need to understand the diverse causes that bring it about. Oversimplifications that mistakenly see hunger and famine as an inevitable consequence of population growth do not contribute to this end.";s:10:"post_title";s:49:"Does population growth lead to hunger and famine?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:29:"population-growth-and-famines";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-04-03 16:53:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-04-03 15:53:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=16619";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:5;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16937";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"17";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-28 14:42:11";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-28 14:42:11";s:12:"post_content";s:3123:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This post introduces our <strong><a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Tracker</a></strong>.</div>
In 2015 the world set a new sustainable development agenda, pledging within the United Nations (UN) to achieve 17 development goals by 2030: The <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Sustainable Development Goals</em></a> (also known as <em>The Global Goals</em>). Ranging from eradicating poverty, to ensuring clean energy for all, to reaching sustainable levels of consumption, the array of targets across these goals were selected to drive our efforts in the 15 years up to 2030.

To track progress towards these goals it is necessary to measure how these indicators are changing for all countries around the world and developing an interactive hub where people across the world can explore global or country-level progress seems like an obvious step. However, we were surprised to find that there are currently no resources which do exactly this. There are particular databases¬†‚Äî such as the UN's <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDG Indicators Global Database</a> ‚Äî where raw data and metrics are available to download. But no website to date tracks the progress towards the SDGs in an engaging way that everyone can interact with.

We have therefore created a first <em>prototype</em> of this website ‚Äì the¬†<a href="http://sdg-tracker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OurWorldinData-integ<wbr />rated SDG Tracker</a>.

Our site presents all of the official UN metrics and additional visualizations relevant to each target, where data is available. You will also notice that data is poor or not available for some targets ‚Äî understanding where major data gaps lie is also an important task in tracking progress.

This SDG Tracker links in closely with all of what we cover at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a>. It is in essence an organized summary of many of the trends you find across our publication. Across each goal we highlight the relevant sections of the site where you will find longer-term and additional data and analysis on particular topics. This tracker in its current form is the first prototype of its kind; it is a project we aim to expand upon and keep up-to-date. To help us make it as useful as possible, we are keen to hear your feedback on what works well, what we could do better, and how to extend the reach of SDG engagement as widely as possible. If you have any thoughts, please don't hesitate to get in touch via the 'Feedback' option in the footer of the site.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines">Famines</a>.</div>
This article is the second of a pair of blogs which consider the relationship between famines and population growth. In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines">the first</a>¬†we look at whether population growth is the dominant driver of famine and hunger. Here we consider the demographic impacts of famines, and in particular the extent to which famines may curb population growth.
<h3>The ultimate 'check'?</h3>
English political economist, Thomas Robert Malthus, writing at the turn of the 19th century, is famous for describing famine as "<em>the last, the most dreadful resource of nature</em>" which acts to "<em>level¬†the population with the food of the world"</em>¬†should other forces fail to lower birth rates or increase death rates.[ref] Malthus T.R. 1798.¬†<em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. Chapter VII, p 44.[/ref]

We can think of this ‚ÄòMalthusian‚Äô proposition as containing two separate hypotheses: firstly, that unabated population growth ultimately leads to famine; secondly, that famine acts as a ‚Äòcheck‚Äô to population in this eventuality.

As we explored in our¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines">previous¬†post</a>, recent trends in famine mortality, and hunger more generally, largely contradict the first hypothesis. In this post here we investigate the second, by considering the contribution of famines to long-run population trends. What role has famine played in shaping birth and mortality rates throughout history?

We begin by considering two examples of famines which, from a demographic point of view, differ enormously: the Chinese famine of 1959-61 and that in Ireland in the late 1840s.
<h3>China's 'Great Leap Forward' famine</h3>
The 'Great Leap Forward'-famine in China from 1959-61 was the single largest famine in history in terms of absolute numbers of deaths. Excess mortality estimates vary hugely, but based on our midpoint estimates, it cost more than double the number of lives than any other famine. Our table of famine mortality estimates is available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#the-our-world-in-data-dataset-of-famines">here</a>. The chart below shows the estimated changes to birth and death rates during and after this famine period, in addition to the effect of these changes on overall population size. Alongside a significant jump in death rates, there was also a large fall in births ‚Äî a trend very typical of famines.[ref]See for instance the summary of famine demography in √ì Gr√°da (2009) <em>Famine: A Short History</em>. Princeton.[/ref] However, this was immediately followed by a spike in birth rates in the years immediately following the famine, offsetting to a large degree its demographic effect. This was followed by a steady decline in birth rates throughout the 1960s and 70s, concurrent with domestic birth control policies, but also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL+CHN+TWN+IND+BRA">in line with many other rapidly developing countries</a>.

The trend in mortality rates is similar: the peak generated by the crisis was followed by a continued decline that forms part of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#changes-to-birth-and-death-rate-over-time-around-the-world">common experience of countries</a> as they develop. The key thing to note is that these secular shifts in births and deaths far outweigh the short-lived impact of the famine in determining the long-run trajectory of population growth in China. Despite causing an excess mortality of 2-5% of the total population, and a similar number of 'lost births', we can see from the lower panel in the chart below the famine had next to no discernible impact on population in the long run.

<h3>The Great Irish Famine</h3>
This picture contrasts somewhat with the developments following¬†the Great Irish Famine of the late 1840s, as shown in the chart below. After a period of rapid growth that brought the population to over 8 million, a famine struck that was, in relation to the country's population, far more severe than the 'Great Leap Forward'-famine. It is thought to have reduced the population by about one quarter in its immediate effects: one million perishing and a further million emigrating.¬†But one striking feature of Irish demographics is how the population then continued to shrink following the famine. By 1911 there were in Ireland about half as many people as in 1841. The population only began to grow again in the late 20th century. Is this then an example of a country that learnt from its 'Malthusian lesson'?
<h6>Population of the Island of Ireland, 1500-2000[ref]
Population figures are from Clio-Infra (2016), except for Ireland from 1920 onwards which in the original data refer to the Republic of Ireland only. We add to this population figures for Northern Ireland, based on census data.[/ref]</h6>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-by-country-island-of-ireland-figures" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

This continued depopulation was partly due to low birth rates (which were considerably lower than in England and Scotland in the second half of the 19th century) and partly due to very high levels of outward migration, particularly to the US and Great Britain. Between 1851 and 1900, there were almost as many outward migrants as there were deaths in Ireland (4.18 million and 4.56 million, respectively)[ref]According to John Fitzgerald, President of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in his <a href="http://edepositireland.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/79414/7%20fitzgerald.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">May 2016 Presidential Address</a>. [/ref]. According to¬†Cormac √ì Gr√°da, "<em>during the decades between the Great Famine and World War One the probability of a young Irishman or Irishwoman not emigrating was less than one in two.</em>"

&nbsp;

As √ì Gr√°da argues, the only way a famine can have any real lasting demographic impact is if it "teaches" the population to alter marriage and family planning practices to reduce fertility rates.[ref]√ì Gr√°da, <em>Famine: A Short History,¬†</em>2009.[/ref] There is some evidence of changing behaviour in Ireland following the famine, including more people choosing to marry later or not all. However it is difficult to know if this is directly attributable to the famine, or if it instead reflects people's responses to other changes taking place at the time, such as increasing life expectancy or increasing incomes. Furthermore, whilst total birth rates were low in the post-famine period, the number of children being born to married couples remained high, and the rate of natural increase was highest in those parts of the country worst hit by the famine, complicating any simple explanation along these lines. Similarly, whilst the famine itself clearly provided the impetus for mass emigration, high levels of outward migration began some decades before the famine and continued long afterwards in the context of a much-ameliorated standard of living. Thus, it seems likely that it was the promise of improved economic opportunities, rather than fear of famine which drove emigration between 1851 and 1900.[ref]See¬†√ì Gr√°da,¬†<em>The population of Ireland 1700-1900 : a survey.</em>¬†Annales de D√©mographie Historique, 1979[/ref]

Overall then, even in this seemingly paradigmatic ‚ÄòMalthusian‚Äô example, whilst Ireland undoubtedly did suffer some lasting demographic impacts from the famine, subsequent economic and social developments unrelated to the famine explain the majority of the depopulation the country experienced in the decades following it.
<h3>The role of 'crises' in long-run population trends</h3>
But what can we say about the impact of famines on long-term population trends more generally? ¬†To help answer this question, we look instead at the role of 'population crises' of all kinds ‚Äì that is to say severe spikes in mortality in general, not just those due to famine. What impact have such crises played in shaping population trends, relative to other global developments?

Below are two charts showing the historic evolution of death rates in England and Wales, and in Norway. Data points mark the annual 'Crude Death Rate' (total deaths per 1,000 people) in each country, and a line plotting the 20-year moving average is shown in each case. You can see that the decline in average mortality rates in both countries was preceded by a reduction in the<em> spread</em>¬†around the average i.e., the number and extent of 'crises' of high mortality.[ref]Note that the distribution is skewed: there are no major 'crises' of survival, with mortality rates far below the average. For earlier periods, death rates are extrapolated from parish records, and imprecision in the estimation possibly contributes to the variance.[/ref]
<h6>Historic crude death rates in England and Wales and Norway</h6>

&nbsp;

However, when such spikes were common, they in fact played a relatively small part in keeping average mortality rates as high as they were. Economic Historian, Robert Fogel, in considering the data for England concludes that <em>"crisis mortality</em>[ref]Here he defines this as a CDR that is more than 10% above the 25-year moving average[/ref] <em>[including famine] accounted for less than 5 percent of total mortality in England prior to 1800 and the elimination of crisis mortality accounted for just 15 percent of the decline in total mortality between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries."</em>[ref]Fogel, R. <em>Second Thoughts on the European Escape from Hunger: Famines, Price Elasticities, Entitlements, Chronic Malnutrition, and Mortality</em> Rates. NBER Historical Working Paper No. 1. 1989[/ref] You can picture this by imagining what would happen if you took the highest points in the charts above ‚Äì representing the crises in mortality ‚Äì and moved them downwards towards the average for that time. The line showing the 20-year moving average would indeed fall, but only by a small amount compared to the overall decline.

Falling death rates, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">increasing life expectancy</a>, are trends that took place first in early industrialising countries, but have been a common experience in all parts of the world as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-at-higher-poverty-lines">poverty has declined</a>, and¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta">healthcare</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions">nutrition</a>¬†has improved. But since the 1960s this has been outpaced by a fall in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">birth rates</a>,¬†such that overall the¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth">global population growth</a>¬†rate has been steadily falling, and is likely to approach zero towards the end of this century.¬†The rapid growth in population witnessed since the early 20th century was due to the fall in death rates happening ahead of the fall in birth rates, generating a period of natural increase in between.

This is known as the '<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>': a shift from stable populations with high birth and death rates to stable populations with low birth and death rates, with a period of rapid increase in between due to the fall in mortality preceding the fall in fertility. The chart below shows this transition as it occurred in five very different countries. Here also we can see that the secular decline in death rates follow a reduction in its volatility. But again, the height of the peaks in earlier decades are generally small relative to the overall decline. Even larger crises, such as the "Great Leap Forward", or the spike in mortality in Mauritius in the late 1920s,[ref]The¬†Wikipedia page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mauritius#British_rule_(1810‚Äì1968)">history of Mauritius</a> says that¬†<em>"conflicts arose between the Indian community (mostly sugarcane labourers) and the Franco-Mauritians in the 1920s, leading to several ‚Äì mainly Indian ‚Äì deaths."</em>[/ref] translate into very small changes in overall population trends, if at all. ¬†It is the persistent long-term decline in 'normal' birth and death rates¬†that represent the more significant development for population trends, not the absence of temporary mortality spikes.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
As with any living organism, humans cannot sustain a given population without sufficient energy resources. Given this, at first glance, it does seem intuitive to assume population growth and famines to be closely linked via food availability. The evidence that this post and <strong>its </strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth-and-famines">companion piece</a>¬†presents, however contradicts any simplified view of this relationship as it fails to acknowledge the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-far-fewer-people-die-in-famines-today">diverse causes of famines</a> and population dynamics.

The analogy to other living organisms can obscure what is different about the human species. We organize ourselves into complex social and political structures capable of incredible joint accomplishments ‚Äì such as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases">eradication of diseases</a> ‚Äì but also of inflicting, or consciously allowing, unimaginable suffering ‚Äì including the majority of famine deaths to date. The capacity of the planet to feed us <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture">is not a fixed constant</a>, imposed by nature, but rather depends also on us: on our agricultural practices, the development and transmission of knowledge and technology, and also crucially upon our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets">choice of diet</a> ‚Äì an inherently cultural act.

The population growth rate is now declining, not, thankfully, due to more frequent crises of mortality but because people, through their own volition, are choosing to have fewer children.¬†This change is very much associated to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#increasing-prosperity-and-structural-transformation-of-the-economy">rising incomes</a> and other social developments in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#increasing-well-being-and-status-of-children">health</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#women-s-education">education</a>, and has tended to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#fertility-rates-can-decline-extremely-fast">happen more quickly</a> in countries that have developed more recently.¬†If we need any generalization here, it is¬†<em>plenty</em>¬†‚Äì in terms of improved access to adequate food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education and so on ‚Äì rather than¬†scarcity, that is slowing down our species' multiplication.

This isn't to say that increased populations and affluence haven't caused environmental damage, nor that this in turn poses no risks to our future well-being. But the idea we are helpless to stop famines in the face of high population growth in some parts of the world, or that famines represents any kind of 'solution' to the environmental problems humans are causing, as some Malthusians suggest, are two hypotheses that do little to help either humanity or the planet.

The differences between the economies of Switzerland and Guatemala go beyond differences in size. The Swiss economy has different inputs that can be used to produce a very different mix of outputs. In other words, the Swiss economy has different ‚Äòproductive capabilities‚Äô.

Productive capabilities are important to understand economic development. But, what exactly are productive capabilities? And how can we measure them?

Ricardo Hausmann and Cesar Hidalgo argue that productive capabilities are all the inputs, technologies and ideas that, in combination, determine the frontiers of what an economy can produce. They argue that productive capabilities include all sorts of things: infrastructure, land, laws, machines, people, books, and collective knowledge.

Since measuring and comparing such diverse and complex productive capabilities is difficult, Hausmann and Hidalgo <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/26/10570.full.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">propose</a> using a proxy, called the <em>Economic Complexity Index</em> (ECI), which tries to measure capabilities indirectly by looking at the mix of products that countries export. 

The assumption is that productive capabilities determine the number and quality of products that a country can export; so export bundles tell us something about the underlying productive capabilities. For example, we might infer that Switzerland and Japan have similar productive capabilities, because they are both able to produce a similar set of goods.

To use a metaphor: If economies are like restaurants, then productive capabilities are all the stuff that is needed in the kitchen; so the <em>Economic Complexity Index</em> ranks the restaurants by comparing the menus, rather than by comparing the recipes, food and people behind the kitchen doors.

In a nutshell, the ECI is an algorithm such that (i) restaurants that serve a more diverse and sophisticated menu are scored higher, and (ii) restaurants that serve similar menus have similar scores. 

<h4>A closer look at the Economic Complexity Index</h4>

The ECI takes data on exports, and reduces a country‚Äôs economic system into two dimensions: (i) The 'diversity' of products in the export basket, and (ii) the ‚Äòubiquity‚Äô of products in the export basket. Diversity is the number of products that a country can export competitively. And ubiquity is the number of countries that are able to export a product competitively.

To measure these two dimensions, the ECI uses a cross-country export matrix. That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product exports.

Loosely speaking, the least complex countries, at the bottom of the ECI rank, are those that export very few different types of products (i.e. have export baskets that are not diversified) and those products that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e. export baskets that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products). 

By this logic, Germany ranks high in economic complexity, because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified productive capacities. 

The following chart shows ECI rankings for all countries in the world, over time.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-complexity-rankings?year=2012" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

MIT's <a href="https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/">Observatory of Economic Complexity</a> and Harvard's <a href="http://globe.cid.harvard.edu/">Atlas of Economic Complexity</a> are both great data visualisation websites that have much more data on ECI, countries' trade relationships, and the composition of traded goods.

<h4>From economic complexity to economic growth</h4>

The chart below shows the relationship between ECI rankings and GDP per capita. As we can see, there is a clear correlation: richer countries tend to rank higher in the ECI. The countries on the lower ranks of the ECI are much poorer than the high-ranked countries in the top-left corner.
 
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eci-ranking-vs-gdp-per-capita" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

In the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/26/10570.full.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">academic paper</a> where Hidalgo and Hausmann introduced their concept of ‚Äòeconomic complexity‚Äô, they noted that the correlation between the ECI and GDP per capita is very robust; and they showed that, beyond this, the ECI actually predicts economic <em>growth</em> after statistically controlling for other baseline country characteristics. So countries with higher economic complexity than their level of GDP per capita would suggest, can be expected to grow faster. 

Consider, for example, Malaysia: As we can see in the chart above, Malaysia is further left along the horizontal axis than other countries located at the same height along the vertical axis. So, statistically speaking, it is likely that Malaysia will grow faster than these other countries.

The intuition for why economic complexity predicts growth can be understood in terms of unexploited productive potential. Countries that are below the income expected from their capability endowment, are countries that will likely shift towards the product-mix that is feasible with their existing capabilities, and which richer countries have already successfully developed.

This takes us to the main lesson from economic complexity: Different types of exports are associated with different economic outcomes. [ref]It's not only about GDP growth. In a recent paper Hartmann, D., Guevara, M.R., Jara-Figueroa, C., Aristaran, M., Hidalgo, C.A., suggest the ECI is a predictor of income inequality levels. They show that countries exporting more economically complex products have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting more ubiquitous products. Available online <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15309876">here</a>.[/ref]

This is in line with the well-studied phenomenon of ‚Äòpremature de-industrialization‚Äô. Emerging economies that fail to develop their manufacturing sector as they grow, are likely to suffer from lower growth prospects later down the line, because manufacturing industries tend to be particularly conducive to productivity growth. (You can read more about ‚Äòpremature de-industrialization‚Äô in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/growth-and-structural-transformation-are-emerging-economies-industrializing-too-quickly" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our blog post here</a>.)

<h4>What does this mean in terms of economic policy? </h4>

The fact that different types of exports are associated with different economic outcomes suggests that policymakers should try to focus on relaxing specific productivity constraints in key sectors that are likely to unlock growth potential. 

Does this imply that countries that are less economically complex, as determined by the ECI, should focus on diversification? Not necessarily.

The <em>type</em> rather than the <em>number</em> of industries and occupations concentrated in a region might matter more for economic prosperity. So the objective of industrial policy should not be diversification per se.[ref]For more details on this see Mealy, P., Farmer, J., & Teytelboym, A. (2018). A New Interpretation of the Economic Complexity Index. Available online <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08245.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

Pinning down the ‚Äòkey sectors‚Äô and finding ‚Äòbinding constraints‚Äô is obviously difficult. But it is likely more cost-effective than a one-size-fits-all approach to industrial policy.";s:10:"post_title";s:54:"How and why should we study ‚Äòeconomic complexity‚Äô?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:47:"how-and-why-should-we-study-economic-complexity";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-03-29 09:31:26";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-29 08:31:26";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=17263";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"17948";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"14";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-03-22 15:06:35";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-03-22 15:06:35";s:12:"post_content";s:11323:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.

As discussed in more detail in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famine-mortality-over-the-long-run">previous post</a>, there has been a marked decline in the number of people dying in famines in recent decades, as shown in the chart below.

But does this recent fall really represent a permanent shift, or are we merely witnessing a chance, temporary pause?

To help answer this question, we draw on a recent article by famine researcher Alex de Waal in which he puts forward a number factors that explain the recent reduction in famine mortality.[ref]de Waal, A., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2017.09.004">The end of famine? Prospects for the elimination of mass starvation by political action</a>, Political Geography (2017)[/ref] Whilst a range of triggers for food crises persist today ‚Äì with conflict remaining particularly salient ‚Äì there is a reduced tendency for such crises to translate into episodes of mass mortality. This reduced vulnerability can be linked to a number of long-term global developments, some of which we outline some below. In each case, we provide links to entries across Our World In Data in which you can find more information.

<strong>Increased food supply</strong>

It is natural to link the reduced famine mortality to the significant increases in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person">food per person</a>¬†seen in recent decades, driven primarily by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-vs-land-use-how-has-the-world-produced-enough-food-for-a-growing-population">increasing yields</a>. This, for instance, seems particularly salient in the case of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-per-capita-supply-of-calories?country=CHN+IND+OWID_WRL">China and India</a>, which between them account for well over half of the famine deaths since 1860. Whilst increases in agricultural productivity did contribute to a reduction in global poverty and reduced levels of hunger, the role of food supply per capita in relation to¬†<em>famines</em>¬†is often overemphasised.[ref]Sen's work on entitlements, for instance, marked a more general shift away from the assumption of 'Food Availability Decline' as the default explanation for famines. See, for instance, his 1981 book <em>Poverty and Famines</em>. Stephen Devereux sets this shift in the context of the history of famine scholarship in his 2000 working paper <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf"><em>Famine in the Twentieth Century</em></a>.[/ref] The decline in famine mortality is, rather, the joint outcome of a broader range global developments, including the following.

<strong>Improved health</strong>

The general improvement in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta">global health</a>¬†has undoubtedly played a huge role in reducing famine mortality.[ref]Indeed, de Waal (2017) suggests this may be the single most important factor.[/ref] In most famines the great majority of victims do not die as a direct result of starvation, but rather¬†succumb to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#poor-health-and-infectious-diseases">infectious disease or other illnesses</a>, with some diseases being more directly linked to diet than others. As such, the great strides made in public health, including widespread <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/">vaccination coverage</a>, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#smallpox">eradication of smallpox</a>, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria#malaria-prevalence-historically">reduced prevalence of malaria</a> in many parts of the world, and improvements in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation">access to clean water and sanitation</a>, will have contributed greatly to the general reduction of mortality during food crises.

<strong>Reduced poverty</strong>

As Amartya Sen argued, the fact that there may be enough food available in aggregate within a given area does not necessarily mean that everyone will be able to <em>afford</em> it.[ref]Sen, A, <em>Poverty and Famines</em>. Available online <a href="http://staging.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/1981/81B09_608_engl.pdf">here</a>.[/ref] Unsurprisingly, famines, with few exceptions, happen in very poor countries. As we can see below, most countries in which a famine took place had, at the time, very, very low incomes ‚Äì indeed the average incomes were commonly less than half of that of the UK at the outset of its industrial revolution.

Whilst this refers to average incomes, richer countries also generally have far fewer people living in¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#the-link-between-economic-growth-and-poverty">extreme poverty</a>, both because of higher incomes before tax and benefits, but also due <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#high-income-countries-spend-more-on-social-protection-than-low-income-countries">higher government expenditures and transfers</a>. Higher national incomes are also associated with a range of other improvements in health and physical infrastructure that have also contributed to reducing famine mortality. Thus recent <a href="https://owid.cloud/economic-growth">economic growth</a> ‚Äì most notably that in India and China which, throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries suffered heavily from famine ‚Äì has played an important role in the fall in famine deaths.

<strong>Democratization</strong>

The overwhelming majority of famine deaths occurred in crises due to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#war-and-famines">conflict</a> or with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#democracy-oppression-and-conflict">overt political causes</a>: Amartya Sen is also known for his observation¬†that <em>‚Äúthere has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy‚Äù</em>.[ref]<em>Development as Freedom</em>¬†(1999)[/ref] Whilst there are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#democracy-oppression-and-conflict">some exceptions</a> to this rule that can be debated, the main idea is borne out by historical record.

Thomas Pl√ºmper and Eric Neumayer (2007) note that a number of smaller-scale events in which drought-related mortality did occur <em>have</em> happened in functioning democracies.[ref]Pl√ºmper, Thomas and Neumayer, Eric (2007) <em>Famine mortality, rational political inactivity, and international food aid</em>. PSPE working papers, 02-2007. Department of Government, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK. Available online <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/25169/1/PSPE_WP2_07_%28LSERO%29.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]¬†But they show that democratic institutions are associated with reduced mortality in famines, and also a more effective translation of food aid into fewer deaths. The spread of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democracy">democratic institutions</a> can, therefore, be considered to have contributed to the decline in famine mortality too.

<strong>Demographic transition</strong>

The world is approaching what the late Hans Rosling called ‚Äúthe age of peak child‚Äù: the number of births globally has flattened out and we are not far away from the largest cohort of children that there will likely ever be, as we show in <a href="http://‚Äú&lt;a href=">the age of peak child</a>‚Äù"&gt;our post on peak child.

This is relevant to famine trends because children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable, usually accounting for¬†between one half and two thirds of all excess deaths in famines.[ref]de Waal (2017)[/ref] Whilst the absolute number of children has increased, the fraction of the world population that this vulnerable age group makes up has decreased, and will continue to do so. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#demographic-transition">Demographic transition</a>¬†makes the occurrence of famines with very high mortality rates¬†increasing less likely, both at a global level and as it unfolds in individual countries.
<h3>Famines in the future</h3>
Importantly, our famine data does not include any information on the ongoing food crises in Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria, or elsewhere, including the recent period in which South Sudan was officially declared to be in famine.[ref]For more information on these, see the <a href="http://www.fews.net">Famine Early Warning System</a> website.[/ref] We are, as yet, unaware of any mortality estimates in each case. However, such crises are translating into world hunger levels that do appear to be <a href="http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/">on the rise</a>.

One of the key causes of both famine and food insecurity more generally is conflict. This is as true today as in previous eras.¬†Looking at the previous chart, you can see that a number of significant famines occurred in richer countries around the two World Wars, often in strategic blockades of civilian populations. Many of the most <a href="http://www.fews.net">severe food crises</a> today are also being driven by conflict that can cause disruption to livelihoods, trade and humanitarian access, and often involve outright human rights abuses.[ref]This aspect of famines is described in more detail in the Word Peace Foundation's <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/">Famine Trends</a>¬†website, as well as de Waal (2017)[/ref]

Given this continued potential for populations' food security to be undermined, either as a byproduct, or as a direct strategy of conflict there is nothing 'automatic' about famine mortality remaining at the low levels seen in recent years. Furthermore, climate change ‚Äî in particular the increased frequency of temperature and precipitation extremes, and crop pest and disease risks ‚Äî presents a long-term <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6030e.pdf">threat to food security</a>. However, the global changes that together help explain the recent dramatic reduction in famine mortality ‚Äì improved health, reduced poverty, the spread of democratic institutions,¬†demographic shifts ‚Äì represent fundamental long-term developments. As such, it seems unlikely that famine mortality could return to the kinds of levels witnessed in previous centuries any time soon.

Public debates on climate change frequently exhibit a misunderstanding ‚Äì namely that decarbonisation of our economies necessarily conflicts with economic growth. Ironically, the proponents of this claim come from two antagonistic camps. On the one hand, there are those who believe that addressing climate change must take priority and that this requires an organised diminution of economic output (termed ‚Äúdegrowth‚Äù). On the other hand, there are those who believe that economic growth and the social stability that comes with it should be prioritised: concerning oneself with climate policy should not be a priority if it impacts competitiveness.
<h3>The technological feasibility of decoupling emissions</h3>
One key distinction to elucidate the debate is between the technological and the political feasibility of ‚Äúdecoupling‚Äù of <a href="https://owid.cloud/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">emissions</a> from <a href="https://owid.cloud/economic-growth">growth</a>. Decoupling can be relative (when rates of economic growth are higher than rates of emissions growth) or absolute (when emissions fall in absolute terms even as the economy continues to grow). A further question only indirectly related to climate change mitigation is whether human well-being itself can be decoupled from economic growth.

This post focuses on the <em>technological feasibility</em> of absolute decoupling. Any cogent claim about appropriate responses to environmental problems must start with a normative benchmark, which for climate change mitigation is provided by assessments of optimal technology deployment and demand restructuring. Whether or not the optimal mix of relevant technologies is politically feasible is a different question entirely, but the two must be distinguished clearly for coherent policy advice.

Indeed much sophisticated modelling has been carried out to show that the transformation to carbon-free economies is technologically feasible.[ref]Clarke L., K. Jiang, K. Akimoto, M. Babiker, G. Blanford, K. Fisher-Vanden, J.-C. Hourcade, V. Krey, E. Kriegler, A. L√∂schel,

(2014).¬†IPCC, 2014: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.[/ref] This is a small number compared to projections that the world economy will continue to grow at 2 percent per year, although in the order of the costs of any other major political reform. Furthermore, a substantial part of decarbonisation of the European Economy by 2030 is <em>already </em>economically cost-effective.[ref]IRENA (2018).¬†Renewable Energy Prospects for the European Union. Available <a href="https://irena.org/publications/2018/Feb/Renewable-energy-prospects-for-the-EU">online</a>.[/ref]

Global decoupling is not yet happening: Although annual global emissions have been stable in 2014-2016, they rose again in 2017.[ref]Jackson et al. (2017). Warning Signs for Stabilising global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Available <a href="ttp://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa9662/meta">online</a>.[/ref] However, it would be premature to draw conclusions about the future based on past trends.
<h3>Emission-intensive sectors are only a minor part of the economy</h3>
Our data[ref]World Input-Output Database 2013 release [Timmer, M. P., Dietzenbacher, E., Los, B., Stehrer, R. and de Vries, G. J. (2015),"An Illustrated User Guide to the World Input‚ÄìOutput Database: the Case of Global Automotive Production", Review of International Economics., 23: 575‚Äì605]. Year 2009 in basic prices, value added computed as net sectoral output (gross sectoral output less sectoral input).[/ref] illustrates one major reason behind the modelling consensus that decarbonisation and economic growth are compatible: in rich countries, sectors contributing most to economic output typically do not contribute to emissions significantly (Figure 1).¬†Further, in many sectors absolute decoupling has been happening (Figure 2). This is true across such diverse economies as China, Germany and the United States (as shown in the three charts of Figure 1).
<h6>Figure 1: Contribution of individual sectors to net economic output and total country emissions in 2009. Sectors above the line contribute more to the value added than emissions of the country.</h6>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/value-added-vs-share-of-emissions-usa" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

So if the most powerful economic sectors are not emissions intensive, then regulating emissions need not affect economic prosperity or output in developed economies. The virtual economy and high-skilled jobs have grown disproportionately faster than heavy industry (Figure 2) in the recent past. Even in China, the service sector has grown from contributing 24% to total economic output in 1995 to 33% in 2009, when most of the emissions ‚Äúexported‚Äù from high to lower-income countries went to Chinese manufacturing. In the United States the service sector contribution has increased from 52% to 58% and in Germany from 50% to 55%. This growth in services has arisen mostly at the expense of heavy industry (which fell from 17.5% to 14.7% and 27% to 23%, in the USA and Germany, respectively), in addition to a fall in China's agricultural contribution. This is particularly notable in China, a country to which polluting industry has often been exported; the vast majority of all sectors have experienced much faster growth in economic output than in emissions. Thus, relative decoupling is a technical feasibility.
<h6>Figure 2: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions<sub>¬†</sub>growth of individual sectors between 1995 and 2009 (adjusted for inflation). Sectors in the top left quadrant have decoupled their emissions from economic growth - whilst their emissions fell, their economic value grew.</h6>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/value-added-growth-vs-emissions-growth-usa" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/value-added-growth-vs-emissions-growth-germany" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

On the other hand, Figure 1 shows that the sector that contributes by far the most emissions is energy and electricity generation, in Germany in 2009 it accounted for 51% of emissions and less than 3% of value added. Decarbonisation of the energy sector would thus contribute greatly to the decarbonisation of the economy without significantly affecting overall economic output, as a first approximation. Clearly, supply chains connect the growth and size of economic sectors. For instance, the digital economy requires a notable amount of electricity and material infrastructure. Yet, decarbonising the supplying sectors allows economic growth of the whole sectoral chain without a parallel growth in emissions.
<h3>The three main arguments why growth and decarbonisation are compatible</h3>
However, is this argument about the separation of economically important and emission-intensive sectors na√Øve?¬† After all, in the past, sustained economic growth has always coincided with growth in emissions. This objection is intuitive, but equates a correlation from a time with little political effort in climate protection with causation. We next revisit the main conceptual arguments behind why modelling consistently shows decarbonisation and economic growth are compatible under optimal policy.

Beyond our simple plots that disentangle value added and emissions by sector, three further arguments make the equivalence of economic output growth and increasing emissions implausible. First, the fast development and high deployment of renewable energy technologies has brought down their production costs so far that for the first time, deploying solar and wind renewables is cheaper, on a life-cycle cost basis, than building fossil power stations.[ref]See Lazard's <a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-2017/">Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE)</a> Analysis, and Creutzig et al. (2017). The underestimated potential of solar energy to mitigate climate change.¬†<em>Nature</em> Energy, <strong>2</strong>. Available <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2017140">online</a>.[/ref]

Second, economies have been remarkably reactive to price signals and easily overcame substantial constraints in the past.[ref]See, for example, Beckert, S. (2004). Emancipation and Empire: Reconstructing the Worldwide Web of Cotton Production in the Age of the American Civil War.¬†<i>The American Historical Review,</i>¬†<i>109</i>(5), 1405-1438. Available <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530931?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">online</a>.[/ref] As resources become scarcer and prices increase, opportunities for substitutes arise. On an individual level, substantial price changes, even on fuel, do reduce demand.[ref]Zimmer, A., &amp; Koch, N. (2017). Fuel consumption dynamics in Europe: Tax reform implications for air pollution and carbon emissions.¬†<i>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice</i>,¬†<i>106</i>, 22-50. Available <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856416307650">online</a>.[/ref] One can thus be optimistic about the development of low-carbon production technologies if substantial carbon prices are put in place. Historically, higher rates of economic growth have also been correlated with higher rates of innovation.[ref]Hasan, I., &amp; Tucci, C. L. (2010). The innovation‚Äìeconomic growth nexus: Global evidence.¬†<i>Research Policy</i>,¬†<i>39</i>(10), 1264-1276. Available online.[/ref]

Third, low-carbon substitutes for some goods are indeed difficult to conceive at the timescales required to successfully address the <a href="http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world's climate targets</a>, including reaching carbon neutrality within the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Meat consumption and aviation are highly emissions-intensive activities for which this is a case in point¬†‚Äî 'artificial meat' and 'electric planes' may take too long to become marketable to achieve these goals. However, as Figure 1 shows, these sectors are relatively small in terms of value added in developed economies. Therefore, reducing meat consumption and air transport, albeit partly controversial, should be feasible without large economic losses. One might go even further and question the interlinkage of consumption levels from these goods/services and societal well-being.[ref]Creutzig, F., Roy, J., Lamb, J. W. F., Azevedo, I. M. L., Bruine de Bruin, W., Dalkmann, H., Edelenbosch, O. Y., Geels, F.W., Grubler, A., Hepburn, C.,
Hertwich, E.G., Khosla, R., Mattauch, L.,Minx, J.C., Ramakrishnan, A., Rao, N.D., Steinberger, J.K.,Tavoni, M., √úrge-Vorsatz, D. and Weber, E.U. (2018). Towards demand-side solutions for mitigating climate change.¬†<i>Nature Climate Change</i>¬†8: 268-271. Available <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0121-1">online</a>.[/ref] However, the last point raises intricate questions about what really matters for quality of life and what the 'good' society looks like.[ref]Mattauch, L., Ridgway, M., &amp; Creutzig, F. (2016). Happy or liberal? Making sense of behavior in transport policy design.¬†<i>Transportation research part D: transport and environment</i>,¬†<i>45</i>, 64-83. Available online.[/ref]<sup>,¬†</sup>[ref]Mattauch, L., &amp; Hepburn, C. (2016). Climate policy when preferences are endogenous‚Äîand sometimes they are.¬†<i>Midwest Studies in Philosophy</i>,¬†<i>40</i>(1), 76-95. Available online.[/ref]

These arguments have a significant implication for what governments should focus on in order to tackle climate change: curtail emissions in the highly emitting sectors! This can be achieved by levying a significant and reliable price on anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions - either through a tax or an emissions trading scheme. It will imply that appropriate low-carbon alternatives are developed.¬† If done well, this can even increase productivity and create additional economic growth, as a <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/news/good-climate-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent article</a> shows: aggregate investment is channeled from fossil resources into additional productive capital.[ref]Siegmeier, J., Mattauch, L., &amp; Edenhofer, O. (2018). Capital beats coal: How collecting the climate rent increases aggregate investment.¬†<i>Journal of Environmental Economics and Management</i>, 88: 366‚Äî378. Available <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617308707">online</a>.[/ref] Alternatively, an outright ban on the most emissions-intensive economic activities, such as burning coal, would achieve equal results in terms of emissions reductions, but forgo some of the economic benefits of decarbonizing the economy by appropriate price signals. In countries in which strong mitigation policies are in place, such as Sweden and Switzerland, emissions are declining. It is true that a portion of these reductions may be attributed to carbon leakage ‚Äì <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#co2-emissions-and-prosperity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions are partly outsourced</a> as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/growth-and-structural-transformation-are-emerging-economies-industrializing-too-quickly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">production shifts</a> to poorer or less environmentally regulated countries.Yet if just a limited number of countries decarbonise, carbon leakage is only an obstacle to emission reductions as long as national economies do not impose tariffs on the carbon content of products they import.
<h3>Individual responsibility and sufficiency</h3>
While society at large has better alternatives to slowing growth, this is not necessarily true at the individual level. But what should an <em>individual¬†</em>do about climate change? While governments can target various sectors, consumers are limited to choose between already existing products. Information about emissions along the entire supply and production chain (including potential carbon leaks) are also typically lacking. Moreover, motivated individuals typically care about other dimensions of environmental sustainability, such as biodiversity and water use. Missing information and multiple objectives make product choice by individuals a different decision-making problem. Thus, at the private level, a more general sufficiency strategy of reducing material consumption overall may be appropriate.[ref]Wynes, S., &amp; Nicholas, K. A. (2017). The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions.¬†<i>Environmental Research Letters</i>,¬†<i>12</i>(7), 074024. Available <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541">online</a>.[/ref] Nonetheless, focusing on the most emissions-intensive activities such as road and air transport or meat consumption would make a certain contribution to climate change mitigation. Reducing material throughput is also strategy applicable at the economy-wide level; an example is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/jobs-growth-and-investment/towards-circular-economy_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Union Circular Economy policy</a><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">.</span>¬†However, this has the purpose of creating innovation and redesigning waste contributing to energy efficiency.
<h3>Implications for climate policy</h3>
We conclude that contrasting climate protection with economic growth, as is so frequently done, is misleading. Economic growth emerges from individual instincts for improvements from billions of talented humans. Slowing down economic growth would mean suppressing that instinct, at enormous losses of individual freedom. So climate protection can only be successful by redirecting these instincts towards carbon-free production processes, creating a different sense of what is considered an improvement and, in rare cases, forgoing some benefits of irreplaceable high-carbon consumption options. Rather than emphasizing potential competitiveness concerns, debates about climate policy should focus on implementability of policy, political will and responsibility of actors, including private individuals.";s:10:"post_title";s:34:"Shrink emissions, not the
