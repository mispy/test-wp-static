<!---------------------------------->
Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a gas essential for lifeâ€”animals exhale it, plants sequester it. It exists in Earth's atmosphere in comparably small concentrations, but is vital for sustaining life. CO<sub>2</sub> is also known as a greenhouse gas (GHG)â€”a gas that absorbs and emits thermal radiation, creating the 'greenhouse effect'. Along with other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide and methane, CO<sub>2</sub> is important in sustaining a habitable temperature for the planet: if there were absolutely no GHGs, our planet would simply be too cold. It has been estimated that without these gases, the average surface temperature of the Earth would be about -18 degrees celsius.[ref]Qiancheng Ma (1998).

Since the Industrial Revolution, however, energy-driven consumption of fossil fuels has led to a rapid increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, disrupting the global carbon cycle and leading to a planetary warming impact. Global warming and a changing climate have a range of potential ecological, physical and health impacts, including extreme weather events (such as floods, droughts, storms, and heatwaves); sea-level rise; altered crop growth; and disrupted water systems. The most extensive source of analysis on the potential impacts of climatic change can be found in the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report; this presents full coverage of all impacts in <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its chapter on</a>Â Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.[ref]2014: Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

This entry provides a historical to present day perspective of how CO<sub>2</sub>Â emissions have evolved, how emissions are distributed, and the key factors that both drive these trends and hold the key to mitigating climate change.

To set the scene, let's briefly look at how the planet has warmed â€” particularly since the Industrial Revolution. In the chart below the x-axis shows the time spanning 1850 to 2017. On the y-axis, we see the global average temperature rise above or below the 1961-1990 baseline temperature. This means that we use the average temperature over the 1961-1990 period as a baseline against which yearly changes in temperature are measured.

The redÂ line represents the average annual temperature trend through time, with upper and lower confidence intervals (the possible upper and lower range) shown in light grey. We see that over the last few decades, temperatures have risen sharply at the global levelÂ â€” to approximately 0.8 degrees celsius higher than our 1961-1990 baseline. When extendedÂ back to 1850, we see that temperatures then were a further 0.4 degrees colder than they were in our 1961-1990 baseline. Overall, if we look at the total temperature increase since pre-industrial times, this therefore amounts to approximately 1.2 degrees celcius. We have now surpassed the one-degree mark, an important marker as it brings us more than halfway to the global limit of keeping warming below two degrees celsius.

In the interactive chart below you can also view these trends by hemisphere (North and South), as well as the tropics (defined as 30 degrees above and below the equator). Here we see that the median temperature increase in the North Hemisphere is higher, at closer to 1.4Â degrees celcius since 1850, and less in the Southern Hemisphere (closer to 0.8 degrees celcius). Evidence suggests that this distribution is strongly related to ocean circulation patterns (notably the North Atlantic Oscillation) which has resulted in greater warming in the northern hemisphere.[ref]Delworth, T. L., Zeng, F., Vecchi, G. A., Yang, X., Zhang, L., &amp; Zhang, R. (2016).

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The long-run history: Cumulative CO<sub>2</sub></h3>
If we extend our timeline back to 1750 and total up how much CO<sub>2</sub> each country has emitted to date, we calculate each nationâ€™s â€˜cumulative emissionsâ€™.

In the chart below, we have plotted the cumulative emissions of each nation through time from the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2014. The UK was the worldâ€™s first industrial-scale CO<sub>2</sub> emitter. Emissions in other European countries and North America shortly followed and produced CO<sub>2</sub> over the majority of this time period. Other regionsâ€”Latin America, Asia and Africaâ€”started contributing to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions much later, largely contained to the 20th and 21st centuries.

If we fast-forward to the accumulated totals we see today, the US and Europe dominate in terms of cumulative emissions. Chinaâ€™s rapid growth in emissions over the last few decades now makes it the worldâ€™s second largest cumulative emitter, although it still comes in at less than 50% of the US total.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co2-million-tonnes?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<!---------------------------------->
<h3>Annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h3>
If we forget the cumulative time dimension and focus only on annual emissions, how do more recent annual emission trends compare?Â In the chart below, we can view annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by country. You can select a range of countries to compare through time in the "chart" tab, or alternatively click on a country on the "map" tab to see its time series. In support of the cumulative chart we explored above, we can see that the annual trends of European and North American nations have grown much earlier than in other regions.

Emissions from a number of growing economies have been increasing rapidly over the last few decades. Fast-forwarding to annual emissions in 2014, we can see that a number of low to middle income nations are now within the top global emitters. In fact, China is now the largest emitter, followed by (in order) the US, EU-28, India, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan, Canada and Mexico. Note that a number of nations that are already top emitters are likely to continue to increase emissions as they undergo development.

In contrast to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions growth in low to middle income economies, trends across many high income nations have stabilized, and in several cases decreased in recent decades. Despite this downward trend across some nations, emissions growth in transitioning economies dominates the global trendâ€”as such, global annual emissions have continued to increase over this period.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-million-tonnes-co2?tab=map&amp;year=2014" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<!---------------------------------->
<h3>Per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h3>
The key drawback of measuring the total national emissions is that it takes no account of the nation's population size. China is currently the worldâ€™s largest emitter, but since it also has the largest population, all being equal we would expect this to be the case. To make a fair comparison of contributions, we have to therefore compare emissions in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per person.

In the map below we compare CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita through time since 1950. Again, if we cycle through time by moving the slider below the map, we see that per capita emissions in most countries have continued to increase in line with development. However, if we look at the distribution of per capita emissions in 2014, large global inequalities remain.

Note that carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas which contributes to climate changeâ€”nitrous oxide and methane are also greenhouse gases, but are not included here. Food production, especially intensive livestock-rearing for meat and dairy, is a major contributor to both of these non-CO<sub>2</sub>Â GHGs. Since capita meat intakeÂ is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-consumption-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly linked to GDP</a> levels, per capita emissions ofÂ nitrous oxide and methane tend to be much largerÂ in high-income nations. Therefore, if these gases <em>were</em> included alongside CO<sub>2,</sub> the global inequalities would be even higher.

With a few exceptions, there is an important north-south divide in terms of per capita emissions. Most nations across sub-Saharan Africa, South America and South Asia have per capita emissions below five tonnes per year (many have less than 1-2 tonnes). This contrasts with the global north where emissions are typically above five tonnes per person (with North America above 15 tonnes). The monthly emissions per capita in rich countries are mostly higher than the yearly emissions per capita in poorer countries. The largest emitter, Qatar, has per capita emissions of 50 tonnes per year (1243 times that of Chad, the lowest emitter).

<!---------------------------------->
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by source</h3>
Carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy and industrial production can come from a range of fuel types. The contribution of each of these sources has changed significantly through time, and still shows large differences by region. In the chart below we see the absolute and relative contribution of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by source, differentiated between gas, liquid (i.e. oil), solid (coal and biomass), flaring, and cement production.

At a global level we see that early industrialisation was dominated by the use of solid fuelâ€”this is best observed by switching to the 'relative' view in the chart. Coal-fired power at an industrial-scale was the first to emerge in Europe and North America during the 1700s. It wasnâ€™t until the late 1800s that we begin to see a growth in emissions from oil and gas production. Another century passed before emissions from flaring and cement production began. In the present day, solid and liquid fuel dominate, although contributions from gas production are also notable. Cement and flaring at the global level remain comparably small.

You can also view these trends across global regions in the chart below, by clicking on 'change region'. The trends vary significantly by region. Overall patterns across Europe and North America are similar: early industrialisation began through solid fuel consumption, however, through time this energy mix has diversified. Today, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are spread fairly equally between coal, oil and gas. In contrast, Latin America and the Caribbeanâ€™s emissions have historically been and remain a product of liquid fuelâ€”even in the early stages of development coal consumption was small.[ref]Zilio, M., &amp; Recalde, M. (2011). GDP and environment pressure: the role of energy in Latin America and the Caribbean. <i>Energy Policy</i>, <i>39</i>(12), 7941-7949.

B., Saidur, R., &amp; Hossain, M. S. (2011). A review on emission analysis in cement industries. <i>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews</i>, <i>15</i>(5), 2252-2261.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-by-source-million-tonnes" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>CO<sub>2</sub> emissionsâ€”global and regional trends</h4>
The visualisation below presents the long-run perspective on global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Global emissions increased from 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 1900 to over 36 billion tonnes 115 years later.

What do our most recent trends in emissions and concentrations look like? Are we making any progress in reduction?

Our latest data suggests that over the last few years (2014-2016), global annual emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> have approximately stabilized. This slowdown is too recent to ascertain whether this stabilization in emissions represents a peak (with a reduction trend to follow), or a plateau. A large contribution to a stabilization in global emissions is thought to be a recent plateau in Chinaâ€™s (the worldâ€™s largest emitter) emissions. Regionally, we see that the emissions across a number of high-income countries in Europe and the Americas have peaked and were falling during the last decade.

<!---------------------------------->
<h3>Impact of emissions on atmospheric concentrations</h3>
The large growth in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions has had a significant impact on the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. If we look at atmospheric concentrations <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/2000YearsCO2concentration/2000YearsCO2concentration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the past 2000 years</a> (see the Data Quality and Measurement section in this entry for explanation on how we estimate historical emissions), we see that levels were fairly stable at 270-285 parts per million (ppm) until the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Since the Industrial Revolution, global CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been increasing rapidly.

However, CO<sub>2</sub> is not the only GHG weâ€™re concerned aboutâ€”emissions of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) have also been increasing rapidly through agricultural, energy, and industrial sources. Like CO<sub>2</sub>, the atmospheric concentration of both of these gases has also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/2000YearsNH4andN2Oconcentration/2000YearsNH4andN2Oconcentration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been rising rapidly</a>.

Has a global stabilization of CO<sub>2</sub> emissionsÂ over the last few yearsÂ had an impact on global atmospheric concentrations? While it appears progress is being made on global emissions, atmospheric concentrations continue to rise, as shown below. Atmospheric concentrations have now broken the 400ppm thresholdâ€”<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/05/130510-earth-co2-milestone-400-ppm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considered its highest level</a> in the last threeÂ million years.Â To begin to stabiliseâ€”or even reduceâ€”atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, our emissions need to not only stabilise but also decrease significantly.

Why would a stabilization in CO<sub>2</sub>Â emissions not directly translate into the same for atmospheric concentrations? This is because CO<sub>2</sub> accumulates in the atmosphere based on what we call a 'residence time'. Residence time is the time required for emitted CO<sub>2</sub>Â to be removed from the atmosphere through natural processes in Earth's carbon cycle. The length of this timeÂ can varyâ€”some CO<sub>2</sub> is removed in less than 5 years through fast cycling processes, meanwhile other processes, such as absorption through land vegetation, soils and cycling into the deep ocean can take hundreds to thousands of years. If we stopped emitting CO<sub>2</sub> today, it would take several hundred years before the majority of human emissions were removed from the atmosphere.[ref]Ciais, P., C. Sabine, G. Bala, L. Bopp, V. Brovkin, J. Canadell, A. Chhabra, R. DeFries, J. Galloway, M. Heimann, C. Jones, C. Le QuÃ©rÃ©, R.B. Myneni, S. Piao and P. Thornton, 2013: Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles.

<h3>Greenhouse gas emission sources</h3>
<h4>Global warming potential of greenhouse gases</h4>
Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas of concern for global warming and climatic change. There are a range of greenhouse gases, which include methane, nitrous oxide, and a range of smaller concentration trace gases such as the so-called group of 'F-gases'.

Greenhouse gases vary in their relative contributions to global warming; i.e. one tonne of methane does not have the same impact on warming as one tonne of carbon dioxide. We define these differences using a metric called 'Global Warming Potential' (GWP). GWP can be defined on a range of time-periods, however the most commonly used (and that adopted by the IPCC) is the 100-year timescale (GWP<sub>100</sub>).[ref]IPCC, 2014: Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Core Writing Team, R.K. Pachauri and L.A. Meyer (eds.)]. IPCC, Geneva, Switzerland, 151 pp. Available <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf">online</a>.[/ref]

In the chart below we see the GWP<sub>100</sub> value of key greenhouse gases relative to carbon dioxide. The GWP<sub>100</sub> metric measures the relative warming impact one molecule or unit mass of a greenhouse gas relative to carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale. For example, one tonne of methane would have 28 times the warming impact of tonne of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. GWP<sub>100</sub> values are used to combine greenhouse gases into a single metric of emissions called carbon dioxide equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e). CO<sub>2</sub>e is derived by multiplying the mass of emissions of a specific greenhouse gas by its equivalent GWP<sub>100</sub> factor. The sum of all gases in their CO<sub>2</sub>e form provide a measure of total greenhouse gas emissions.

<h4>Greenhouse gas emissions by gas source</h4>
In the chart below, we see the contribution of different gases to total greenhouse gas emissions. These are measured based on their carbon-dioxide equivalent values (as explained in the section above). Overall we see that carbon dioxide accounts for around three-quarters of total greenhouse gas emissions. However, both methane and nitrous oxide are also important sources, accounting for around 17 and 7 percent of emissions, respectively.

Collectively, HFC, PFC and SF<sub>6</sub> are known as the 'F-gases'. Despite having a very strong warming impact per unit mass (i.e. a high global warming potential), these gases are emitted in very small quantities; they therefore make only a small contribution to total warming.

<h3>Emissions by sector</h3>
Global greenhouse gas emissions are broken down by sectoral sources in the sections which follow (showing carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide individually, as well as collectively as total greenhouse gas terms). The data below is based on UN reported figures, sourced from the EDGAR database. Sources define sectoral emissions groupings in the following way[ref]UN FAO.

<h4>Emissions from agriculture and land use</h4>
Although many people typically attribute CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to energy production, there are other important contributing activities, such as transportation and agriculture. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the agriculture, forestry, and land use (AFOLU) sector was responsible forÂ about one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.[ref]IPCC, 2014: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Edenhofer, O., R. Pichs-Madruga, Y. Sokona, E. Farahani, S. Kadner, K. Seyboth, A. Adler, I. Baum, S. Brunner, P. Eickemeier, B. Kriemann, J. Savolainen, S. SchlÃ¶mer, C. von Stechow, T. Zwickel and J.C. Minx (eds.)].

Total greenhouse gas emissions (measured in their carbon-dioxide equivalent values) by sector are shown in the chart below. The combined figures for agriculture, forestry and land use yield a similar result to that of the IPCC: collectively these emissions account for approximately one-quarter of global emissions.

Why have emissions from agriculture been increasing with time? There are two key contributors to increasing emissions. Firstly, aÂ <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/">growing global population</a> requires an overall higher food production. This increased requirement for food has led to both expansion of agricultural landÂ and an intensification of farming practices.[ref]The application of agricultural inputs, such as nitrogen fertilizer, is a key contributor to nitrous oxide emissions (a potent greenhouse gas).

Agricultural land often expands into previously forested areas, and this process of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/forest-cover/">deforestation</a> releases CO<sub>2</sub>Â stored in trees and soils. These emissions are included in the accounting related to agriculture, forestry and land use (ALOFU), and it is estimated that <a href="http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to 80 percent</a>Â of deforestation is the result of agricultural expansion.

Secondly, global economic growth has not only resulted in an increase in food demand (richer people tend to eat more), but also in changes in dietary composition; that is, changes in what we eat. Economic growth is typically related to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-consumption-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an increase in meat consumption</a>.[ref]Meat production is generally a resource-intensive process, requiring large land, water and feed ressources.

<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and prosperity</h3>
Historically, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been primarily driven by increasing fuel consumption. This energy driver has been, and continues to be, a fundamental pillar of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">economic growth</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/">poverty alleviation</a>. As a result, we see in the visualization below that there is a strong correlation between per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and GDP per capita.

This correlation is also present over time: Countries begin in the bottom-left of the chart at low CO<sub>2</sub> and low GDP,Â and move upwards and to the right. Historically, where fossil fuels are the dominant form of energy, we therefore see increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as an unintended consequence of development and economic prosperity.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita-ppp-international-?time=2014" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

While we see this general relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and GDP, there are outliers in this correlation, and important differences exist in the rate with which per capita emissions have been growing.

These differences are exemplified in global inequalities in energy provision, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and economic disparities. In the chart below we see the change in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e. the growth rates) over the last few decades (1998-2013) across the global spectrum of emitters.

On the x-axis we have the spectrum of global emitters (where those at the far left have very low per capita emissions, and those at the far right have the world's highest per capita emissions). On the y-axis we have the growth (in %) in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that each segment of emitters has undergone from 1998-2013. We see that the middle of the spectrumâ€”typically those near the middle of the global income spectrumâ€”have experienced a large growth in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over the last few decades (most between 25-40%). Insofar as emissions are a correlate of development, this is good news and reflects the fact that a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-economic-inequality">global middle class is developing</a>, but it does present important challenges in terms of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

It is therefore concerning that at the bottom of the spectrum (the group of people of whom many are part of the world's poorer population) have seen a 12% <em>decline</em> in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over this same period. While a decline in emissions is necessary and possible for individuals with high per capita emissions, for the poorest, this potentially suggests stagnation or decline in living conditions.

Not only cross-country inequalities in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are importantâ€”there are also noticeable within-country inequalities. In fact, as the global inequalities in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between countries begin to converge, within-country inequalities become more important. As the chart below shows, in 1998 two-thirds of inequality in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were due to between-country differences. Within-country differences then became more important, and by 2013, within and between-country differences were responsible for roughly the same share of total inequalities.

<!---------------->
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub>Â growth and poverty alleviation</h3>
The link between economic growth and CO<sub>2</sub> described above raises an important question: do we actually want the emissions of low-income countries toÂ <em>grow</em> despite trying to reduce global emissions? In ourÂ historical and current energy system (which has been primarily built on fossil fuels), CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been an almost unavoidable consequence of the energy access necessary for development and poverty alleviation.

In the two charts below, we see per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and energy use per capita (both on the y-axes), plottedÂ against the share of the population living in extreme poverty (%) on the x-axis. In general, we see a very similar correlation in both CO<sub>2</sub> and energy: higher emissions and energy access are correlated to lower levels of extreme poverty. Energy access is therefore an essential component in improved living standards and poverty alleviation.[ref]Chakravarty, S., &amp; Tavoni, M. (2013). Energy poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation: Is there a trade off?. <i>Energy Economics</i>, <i>40</i>, S67-S73. Available at:Â <a id="ddDoi" class="S_C_ddDoi" href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2013.09.022" target="doilink">doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2013.09.022</a>[/ref]

In an ideal world, this energy could be provided through 100% renewable energy: in such a world, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions could be an avoidable consequence of development. However, currently we would expect that some of this energy access will have to come from fossil fuel consumption (although potentially with a higher mix of renewables than older industrial economies). Therefore, although the global challenge is to reduce emissions, some growth in per capita emissions from the world's poorest countries remains a sign of progress in terms of changing living conditions and poverty alleviation.

<!---------------->
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of economies</h3>
If economic growth isÂ historically linked to growing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, why do countries have differing levels of per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-per-capita-tonnes-per-year?country=FRA+DEU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite having similar</a> GDP per capita levels? These differences are captured by the differences in the <em>CO<sub>2</sub> intensity</em> of economies; CO<sub>2</sub> intensity measures the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit of GDP (kgCO<sub>2</sub> per int-$). There are <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two key variables</a> which can affect the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of an economy:
<ul>
 	<li>Energy efficiency: the amount of energy needed for one unit of GDP output. This is often related to productivity and technology efficiency, but can also be related to the type of economic activity underpinning output. If a country's economy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">transitions from manufacturing to service-based output</a>, less energy is needed in production, therefore less energy is used per unit of GDP.</li>
 	<li>Carbon efficiency: the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit energy (grams of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per kilowatt-hour). This is largely related to a country's energy mix. An economy powered by coal-firedÂ energy will produce higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of energy versus an energy system with a high percentage of renewable energy. As economies increase their share of renewable capacity, efficiency improves and the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted per unit energy falls.</li>
</ul>
In the chart below, we see that the global CO<sub>2</sub> intensity has been steadily falling since 1990.[ref] Note that dataÂ of intensity based on collective global/national figures works out the same as when normalised to per capita intensities. This is because in the calculation of per capita figures, both CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and GDP are divided by population size. This means they effectively cancelÂ each other out, giving the same result.[/ref]Â This is likely <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks to</a> both improved energy and technology efficiency, and increases in the capacity of renewables.[ref]Du, K., Lin, B., &amp; Xie, C. (2017). Exploring Change in Chinaâ€™s Carbon Intensity: A Decomposition Approach. <i>Sustainability</i>, <i>9</i>(2), 296. Available <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/2/296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>[/ref] The carbon intensity of nearly all national economies has also fallen in recent decades. Today, we see the highest intensities in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South Africa. This is likely to be a compounded effect of coal-dominated energy systems and heavily industrialized economies. The shift inÂ industrial production from high-income to transitioning economies, and its impact on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, is discussed in the next section.

Although carbon intensities have generally shown a steady, gradual decline in recent decades, dramatic short-term fluctuations in intensity can occurÂ and are typically the result of significant short-term political or economic change. The most dramatic example of this was seen in China during its 'Great Leap Forward' campaign in the 1950s-60s, which we have explored in detail on our blog <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/chinese-turbulence-how-periods-of-political-reform-affect-the-carbon-intensity-of-economies/">here</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-intensity-of-economies-kgco2-per-unit-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<!---------------->
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> intensity and prosperity</h3>
As seen in the section above, the general trend in carbon intensity at the global and national level is a downward trend over time. But how do levels of CO<sub>2</sub> intensity change across different levels of prosperity?

In the chart below we have plotted average carbon intensities by country (y-axis) against gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (x-axis, log scale). As a cross-section across countries in any given year, we see an overall shape akin to an inverted-U. On average, we see low carbon intensities at low incomes; carbon intensity rises as countries transition from low-to-middle incomes, especially in rapidly growing industrial economies; and as countries move towards higher incomes, carbon intensity falls again.

This trend is approximately true as a cross-section across countries. However, such trends differ for individual countries over time. If we view these trends over the timeline from 1990 onwards we see that there are large variations in the evolution of carbon intensities, even for countries with similar income levels.

<!---------------->
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> embedded in trade</h3>
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are most typically measured and reported in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> "production". This accounting method is also sometimes referred to as "territorial-based" emissions because it reports emissions as those emitted within a country's given geographical boundaries. As a result, this method takes no account of emissions which may be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade">imported or exported</a> in the form of traded goods.[ref]Note that there is an important distinction here between tradedÂ <em>goods</em> and tradedÂ <em>fuels</em>. Fuels which are traded, then ultimately burned (with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result) within a country's boundariesÂ <em>are</em> included in production-based accounts. In fact, this trade data on fuel imports and exports is an essential component in reconstructing historical emissions. Production-based accounts, however, do not account for non-fuel traded goods or products. In this case, we assume that the energy necessary to produce these products was consumed within the exporting country's boundaries, and therefore recorded in itsÂ reported CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. For example, if the UK imports coal from China then burns it for energy production, the CO<sub>2</sub>Â from combustion will have been emitted within the UK's boundaries and it will therefore be accounted as emissions of the UK. If the UK imports aluminium from China, the energy and emissions necessary to mine this aluminium would have already been emitted within China's boundaries; in this case the emissions are attributed to China.[/ref]Â "Consumption-based" accounting adjusts CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for this trade of emissions and more accurately reflects the emissions necessary to support a given country's way of living.

What does a global map of traded CO<sub>2</sub> emissions look like? In the map below we see the net emissions transferred between countries as a percentage of their domestic production emissions [you can also view these trends in absolute terms <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-embedded-in-global-trade">here</a>]. The net emissions transfers here is the CO<sub>2Â </sub>embedded in imported goods minus theÂ CO<sub>2Â </sub>embedded in exported goods. This tells us whether a country is a net exporter or importer of emissions. In our chart, positive values (red) indicate a country is a net importer of emissions, and negative values (blue) represent net exporters.Â Here we see an important East-to-West relation, with large exports from Asia and Eastern Europe into Western Europe and North America.

In other words: someÂ of the CO<sub>2</sub> produced (and reported) in emission records of Asian and Eastern European countries is for the production of goods consumed in Western Europe and North America. Based on the updated data gathered by Peters et al. (2012) and the Global Carbon Project[ref](Updated to 2014) Peters, GP, Minx, JC, Weber, CL and Edenhofer, O 2011. Growth in emission transfers via international trade from 1990 to 2008. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108, 8903-8908. Available <a href="http://www.biogeosciences.net/9/3247/2012/bg-9-3247-2012.html">online</a>.[/ref], if we switched to a consumption-based reporting system (which corrects for this trade), in 2014 the annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of many European economies would increase by more than 30% (the UK by 38%; Sweden by 66%; and Belgium's emissions would nearly double); and the USA's emissions would increase by 7%. On the other hand, China's emissions would decrease by 13%; India's by 9%; Russia's by 14% and South Africa by 29%.

The composition of this trade is also important in terms of carbon intensity. In the second figure below we see the carbon intensity (kgCO<sub>2</sub> per $ of trade) for imports and exports across several countries. The goods exported from Russia, China, India, and the Middle East typically have a high carbon intensity, reflecting the fact that their exports are often manufactured goods. In contrast, we see that exportsÂ from the UK, France, Germany and Italy are low; this is likely to be the higher share of export of service-based exports relative to those produced from heavy industry.

<h4>Production vs consumption-based emissions over time</h4>
The chart below shows how production and consumption-based emissions have changed since 1990 across regions and countries. If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production-based emissions then it is a net importer of CO<sub>2</sub>. If production-based emissions are higher, it is a net exporter.

<h3>The costÂ of global CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation</h3>
With an understanding of the link between CO<sub>2</sub> and global temperatures, as well as knowledge of the sources of emissions, an obvious question arises: How much could we reduce our emissions by, and how much would it cost? The possible cost-benefit of taking global and regional action on climate change is often a major influencing factor on the effectiveness of mitigation agreements and measures. How we work out the potential costs of global climate change mitigation has been covered in an explainer post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-much-will-it-cost-to-mitigate-climate-change/">here</a>.
<!-------------------------->
<!-------------------------->
<h2>Data Quality, Definitions and Measurement</h2>
<h3>How do we reconstruct long-term CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations?</h3>
In more recent years, global concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> can be measured directly in the atmosphere usingÂ instrumentation sensor technology. The longest and most well-known records from direct CO<sub>2</sub> measurement comes from the <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO)</a> in Hawaii. The MLO has been measuring atmospheric composition since the 1950s, providing the clearest record of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations across the 20th and 21st century.

To reconstruct long-term CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, we have to rely on a number of geologicalÂ and chemical analogues which record changes in atmospheric composition through time.Â The process of ice-coring allows for the longest extension of historical CO<sub>2</sub> records, extending back 800,000 years.Â The most famous ice core used for historical reconstructions is the <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/vostok.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vostok Ice Core</a> in Antarctica. This core extends back 420,000 years and covers four glacial-interglacial periods.

Ice cores provide a preserved record of atmospheric compositionsâ€”with each layer representing a date further back in time. These can extend as deep at 3km. Ice cores preserve tiny bubbles of air which provide a snapshot of the atmospheric composition of a given period. Using chemical dating techniques (such as isotopic dating) researchers relate time periods to depths through an ice core. If <a href="http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-cores/ice-core-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking at</a> the Vostok Ice Core, researchers can say that the section of core 500m deep was formed approximately 30,000 years ago. CO<sub>2</sub>Â concentration sensors can then be used to measure the concentration in air bubbles at 500m depthâ€”this was approximately 190 parts per million. Combining these two methods, researchers estimate that 30,000 years ago, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was 190ppm.Â Repeating this process across a range of depths, the change through time in these concentrations can be reconstructed.
<h3>How do we measure or estimateÂ CO<sub>2</sub>Â emissions?</h3>
Historical fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be reconstructed back to 1751 based on energy statistics. These reconstructionsÂ detail the production quantities of various forms of fossil fuels (coal, brown coal, peat and crude oil), which when combined with trade data on imports and exports, allow for national-level reconstructions of fossil fuel production and resultant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. More recent energy statistics are sourced from the UN Statistical Office, which compiles data from official national statistical publications and annual questionnaires. Data on cement production and gas flaring can also be sourced from UN data, supplemented by data from the US Department of Interior Geological Survey (USGS) and US Department of Energy Information Administration.Â A full description of data acquisition and original sources can be found at the <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/overview_2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)</a>.

As an example: how do we estimate Canada's CO<sub>2Â </sub>emissions in 1900? Let's look at the steps involved in this estimation.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: we gatherÂ industrial data on how much coal, brown coal, peat and crude oil Canada extracted in 1900. This tells us how much energy it could produce if it used all of this domestically.</li>
 	<li><strong>Step 2:Â </strong>we cannot assume that Canada only used fuels produced domesticallyâ€”it might have imported some fuel, or exported it elsewhere. To find out how much CanadaÂ <em>actually</em> burned domestically, we therefore have to correct for this trade. If we take its domestic production (account for any fuel it stores as stocks), add any fuel it imported, and subtract any fuel it exported, we have an estimate of its net consumption in 1900. In order words,Â if we calculate: coal extraction - coal exported + coal imported - coal stored as stocks, we can estimate the amount of coal Canada burned in 1900.</li>
 	<li><strong>Step 3:Â </strong>converting energy produced to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.Â we know, based on the quality of coal, its carbon content and how much CO<sub>2</sub> would be emitted for every kilogram burned (i.e. its emission factor). Multiplying the quantity of coal burned by its emission factor, we can estimate Canada's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal in 1900.</li>
 	<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> doing this calculation for all fuel types, we can calculate Canada'sÂ total emissions in 1900.</li>
</ul>
Providing good estimates of Â CO<sub>2</sub>Â emissions requires reliable and extensive coverage on domestic and traded energyâ€”the international framework and monitoring of this reporting has significantly improved through time. For this reason, our understanding of emissions in the late 20th and 21st centuries is more reliable than our long-term reconstructions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provide clear guidelines on methodologies and best practice for measuring and monitoring CO<sub>2</sub>Â estimates at the national level.[ref]IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Available <a href="http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/english/6_Uncertainty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a>.[/ref]

There are two key ways uncertainties can be introduced: the reporting of energy consumption, and the assumption of emissions factors (i.e. the carbon content) used for fuel burning. Since energy consumption is strongly related to economic and trade figures (which are typically monitored closely), uncertainties are typically low for energy reporting. Uncertainty can be introduced in the assumptions nations make on the correct CO<sub>2</sub> emission factor for certain fuel types.

Country sizeÂ and the level of uncertainty in these calculations have a significant influence on the inaccuracy of our global emissions figures. In the most extreme example to date, Lui et al. (2015) revealed that China overestimated its annual emissions in 2013 by using global average emission factors, rather than specific figures forÂ theÂ carbon content of its domestic coal supply.[ref]Liu, Z., Guan, D., Wei, W., Davis, S. J., Ciais, P., Bai, J., ... &amp; Andres, R. J. (2015). Reduced carbon emission estimates from fossil fuel combustion and cement production in China. <i>Nature</i>, <i>524</i>(7565), 335-338. Available <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v524/n7565/abs/nature14677.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref] As the world's largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter, this inaccuracy had a significant impact on global emissions estimates, resulting in a 10% overestimation. More typically, uncertainty in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ranges between 2-5%.[ref]Macknick, J. (2011). Energy and CO2 emission data uncertainties. <i>Carbon Management</i>, <i>2</i>(2), 189-205. Available <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4155/cmt.11.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref]
