How many of the world's children live in extreme poverty?  A recent study by the World Bank tries to answer this question. This is a new and insightful exercise, since World Bank estimates are not usually disaggregated by population groups.

The short answer is that about 20% of children under age 18 live on less than $1.90 per day in low and middle income countries. This corresponds to about 385 million children. Below we discuss the evidence in more detail.

<strong>A new source of data on the demographics of poverty</strong>

The World Bank Group has recently published a new set of poverty estimates, as part of their report <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity">Poverty and Shared Prosperity (2016)</a>. These estimates, explained in detail in Newhouse et al. (2016),[ref]Newhouse, D. L., Suarez-Becerra, P., &amp; Evans, M. (2016). New estimates of extreme poverty for children. Policy Research Working Paper 7845. World Bank Group. Available online <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25162/WPS7845.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">here</a>.[/ref] are consistent with the official World Bank poverty figures published in <a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povOnDemand.aspx">Povcal</a> and the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty">World Development Indicators</a>, but they are disaggregated by key demographic characteristics such as age and educational attainment.

In order to produce disaggregated estimates, the World Bank relied on new data from the Global Micro Database ‚Äì an instrument that augments survey data in 89 countries, by providing a set of harmonized household characteristics, enriching the other survey instruments used by the World Bank to measure poverty.

According to Newhouse et al. (2016), the sample of 89 countries included in the Global Micro Database contains an estimated 84.2 percent of the population in low and middle income countries, and 82.1 percent of the child population.[ref]Where 'low and middle income countries' are all countries except Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.[/ref] In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WorldBank-GMD-countries-2016.png" target="_blank">this map</a> you can see exactly which territories are covered. As the authors point out, this new set of estimates is the most updated and comprehensive source currently available to researchers and policymakers trying to understand the demographics of poverty, including <em>child poverty</em> ‚Äì the focus of this blog post.

<strong>Definitions</strong>

Children are considered to live in extreme poverty if they live in an extremely poor household (i.e. all children in poor households are assumed to be poor, while all children in non-poor households are assumed to be non-poor). A household is considered extremely poor, in turn, if the per capita consumption of its members (or per capita income, depending on the country), is less than the International Poverty Line of 1.90 international dollars (int-$). This is the standard definition of absolute extreme poverty used by the World Bank, and it accounts for non-market sources of welfare, as well as for the fact that people in different countries face different price levels (the latter being captured by the so-called 'international dollar' metric). You can read more about how the World Bank measures poverty in our related blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-home-production-and-consumption/">here</a>.

<strong>Findings</strong>

The following chart provides an overview of the data. The hight of each bar in this plot shows the incidence of poverty by age group (i.e. the poverty headcount rate for each age bracket), while the width of the bars reflects the total size of each age group in the overall population. The area of each bar (hight times width) gives the number of individuals living in extreme poverty within each age bracket ‚Äì these are the numbers written inside each bar. 

All estimates correspond to aggregates across the set of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WorldBank-GMD-countries-2016.png" target="_blank">89 countries</a> included in the Global Micro Database. As already mentioned, these countries cover 84.2 percent of the population in low and middle income countries.[ref]Where 'low and middle income countries' are all countries except Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.[/ref] 

As we can see, extreme poverty is higher among the world's children than among the world's adult population: in low and middle income countries more than 20% of children under 10 years of age live with less than 1.90 int-$ per day. For adults, the corresponding figures are much lower: less than 10% of adults live with comparably low consumption levels.

By looking at the total number of people in extreme poverty (area of the bars) we can also see another important fact: virtually half of the people living in extreme poverty are under 18 years of age. This is large if we consider that those under 18 account for only around a third of the general population (width of the bars).

The data from the Global Micro Database allows us to study poverty across age groups for various poverty lines ‚Äì not just the extreme 1.90 int-$ poverty line.

The following chart shows the cumulative distribution of welfare for different age groups. Each of the lines in this plot shows, for a different age group, the share of the population living below a given level of per capita income or consumption (after accounting for differences in prices across countries, here noted in $PPP units ‚Äì a twin concept to 'international dollars').

From this graph, we can read the same numbers we have already discussed. If you locate the vertical line passing through $1.90 in the horizontal axis, you will see that it cuts the series for adults at around 9%. This means that around 9% of the adult population lives with consumption (or income) levels below the 1.90 int-$ poverty line. Following this logic, we can read the poverty rates at any poverty line.

As we can see, the distribution of consumption for adults is always to the right of the distribution for children. In economics lingo, what we observe is that the distribution for adults <em>stochastically dominates</em> that of children. This means that poverty rates for children are higher at any poverty line.

It's important to mention that these results are not reflecting the fact that adults tend to generate more income than children. Bear in mind that these are estimates of <em>household</em> per capita income. That means that children living in households with rich adults are also assumed to be rich.

In the World Bank estimates of global extreme poverty, high-income countries are not accounted for. But how well does this simplifying omission capture the reality of people living there?

A simple look at the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/homelessness-and-poverty-in-rich-countries/" target="_blank">reality of homelessness in high-income countries</a> shows that we need to take this question seriously. 

The short answer is that the real rates of extreme poverty in high-income countries, as measured by the World Bank in low-income countries, are not zero, but are very low. In what follows we discuss the evidence in more detail. 

Importantly, the evidence presented here should not lead one to conclude that "there is no poverty in rich countries," but rather that the standard used to measure <em>extreme</em> poverty is indeed <em>extreme</em>. So extreme, that governments in high-income countries do not use it as a guideline to assess the living standards of their own citizens. Measurement instruments in these countries are simply not designed to capture such levels of extreme deprivation.

<strong>To begin, some historical context</strong>

What do we know about poverty in the rich world before it became rich?

Martin Ravallion (2015)[ref]Ravallion, Martin ‚Äì¬†Poverty in the Rich World When It Was Not Nearly So Rich. CGD; Online <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/blog/poverty-rich-world-when-it-was-not-nearly-so-rich">here.</a>[/ref] tries to answer precisely this question. He estimates poverty by relying on National Accounts. This involves calculating changes in the distributions of income by drawing on academic studies that reconstruct historical levels of economic output and inequality. You can read more about how researchers reconstruct poverty estimates from macro data in our related post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-home-production-and-consumption/"> here.</a>

The chart below plots Ravallion's estimates, showing how extreme poverty declined in today's high-income countries. Two points are worth noting.

First, extreme poverty was very common in today's rich countries until fairly recently; in fact, in most of these countries the majority of the population lived in extreme deprivation only a couple of centuries ago. These huge improvements show that extreme poverty can be reduced very quickly.

And second, we can also see that despite the remarkable improvements mentioned above, in some rich countries ‚Äì notably the United States ‚Äì what appears to be a sizable fraction of the population still lives in extreme poverty (visible here for the year 2000, when Ravallion's estimates end).

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/End-of-absolute-Poverty-in-rich-countries-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9357" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/End-of-absolute-Poverty-in-rich-countries-2-750x525.png" alt="end-of-absolute-poverty-in-rich-countries" width="750" height="525" /></a>

Let's now explore the second point in more detail.

<strong>Extreme poverty in the United States</strong>

According to official estimates, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html" target="_blank">poverty rate in the US was 13.5 percent in 2015</a>. This figure, however, is not really informative about extreme poverty relative to the International Poverty Line used by the World Bank. This is because there are important differences between the US and World Bank methodologies, both in the way monetary welfare is measured and in the thresholds used to define absolute deprivation.

To be more precise, the World Bank figures on extreme poverty refer to individuals living in a household with per capita consumption or income below $1.90. The official US poverty estimates, on the other hand, refer to individuals living in households with incomes below a much higher threshold. Allowances are made for the size and composition of households so that, for example, in a household with 2 adults and 2 children, the poverty line is roughly equivalent to $16.5 per person per day.

So, can we make official US poverty estimates comparable to global estimates by simply applying a lower per capita poverty line? As it turns out, the answer is no. Whether poverty is measured via consumption surveys (as the World Bank does for most countries) or income surveys (as the US does), has significant implications. Several issues play a role here. 

First, each type of survey has  particular weaknesses regarding measurement error ‚Äì for example,  expenditure surveys are known to be particularly sensitive to the choice of reference period (both memory and willingness to maintain a diary impose limits on the period that can be selected to record consumption accurately). Second, survey design affects the particular incentives that respondents have to participate and report accurately ‚Äì for example, some studies have found that respondents in the US are least likely to respond to income surveys in tax-filing months, when it would make most sense to ask about incomes.[ref]See J L Czajka and G Denmead, 2008. Income Data for Policy Analysis: A Comparative Assessment of Eight Surveys. Washington, DC: Mathematica Policy Research, December 2008. Available online here.[/ref] And third, there are valid differences between income and consumption that are not 'errors', but that stem from conceptual inconsistencies between the two ‚Äì for example, restrictive definitions of 'income' might not account for the consumption that occurs out of 'non-income' resources such as savings and assets, borrowing, and some kinds of government welfare benefits.

The following chart from Chandy and Smith (2014)[ref]Chandy, L., and C. Smith. 2014. ‚ÄúHow Poor Are America‚Äôs Poorest? US $2 a Day Poverty in a Global Context.‚Äù Policy Paper 2014-03, Brookings Institution, Washington, DC. Online <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/How-Poor-are-Americas-Poorest.pdf">here</a>.[/ref] shows a number of different poverty-rate estimates, keeping the poverty line fixed at $2 a day, but changing the underlying definition of monetary welfare. Here is a summary of what characterizes each estimate.

<ul>
 	<li>The bars labeled 'Shaefer-Edin' correspond to poverty estimates as reported by¬†Shaefer and Edin (2013).[ref]Shaefer, H. L., & Edin, K. (2013). Rising extreme poverty in the United States and the response of federal means-tested transfer programs. Social Service Review, 87(2), 250-268.[/ref] These estimates come from measuring welfare via income. The lower-poverty estimate includes tax credits and some forms of in-kind government benefits such as food stamps and housing benefits. The higher-poverty estimate excludes these benefits. Both estimates use the Survey of Income and Program Participation as their source, focusing only on households with children. [ref]The source of the chart notes:  Initiated in 1976, the SIPP was specifically designed to overcome some of the known limitations of the Current Population Survey, the source of the official poverty rate, that disproportionately affect the estimation of incomes for poor households. These include the underreporting of participation in government welfare programs and unreliable estimates of irregular sources of income. Evidence confirms that the SIPP obtains the highest estimates of income among low-income households and the most accurate reporting of government program participation among comparable surveys.[/ref]</li>
 	<li>The bars labeled 'SIPP' also correspond to estimates of poverty based on income using data from the¬†Survey of Income and Program Participation. In this case, the different bars indicate different definitions of income - some more inclusive than others - and take into account the general population, including households without children. You can read the appendix in Chandy and Smith (2014) to see how these definitions compare to those from Shaefer and Edin (2013).</li>
 	<li>¬†The bars labeled as 'SPM'¬†correspond to estimates of poverty using the source used for official poverty estimates (the Census Bureau‚Äôs Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement) but applying yet another definition of income, called the Supplementary Poverty Measure (SPM). The SPM definition of income seeks to capture the impact of government policies intended to fight poverty and to exclude necessary expenses such as medical contributions and childcare. [ref]The source of the chart notes: "The SPM was developed in response to criticism of the official poverty measure in the 50 years since it was developed. The SPM‚Äôs design draws from the recommendations of an expert panel of the National Academy of Sciences and more recent academic research, making the SPM an accurate reflection of expert contemporary opinion on how poverty ought to be measured in the US. Notably, its measure of household resources seeks to capture the impact of government policies intended to fight poverty and to exclude necessary expenses such as medical contributions and child care ‚Äì areas where the official poverty measure falls short." [/ref]</li>
 	<li>¬†The bars labeled as 'CEX'¬†correspond to estimates of poverty based on consumption. These estimates use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey.[ref]The source of the chart notes: this survey, which in contrast to the previous two surveys measures consumption as opposed to income, dates back to 1980 and is conducted principally for the purpose of computing weights of the Consumer Price Index.[/ref]</li>
</ul>

As we can see from the chart below, different sources of data give substantially different estimates. And different sources have different limitations. So what can we learn from these numbers?

<h6>Different estimates of $2 a day poverty rate ‚Äì Chandy and Smith (2014)[ref]The source is: Chandy, L., and C. Smith. 2014. ‚ÄúHow Poor Are America‚Äôs Poorest? U.S. $2 a Day Poverty in a Global Context.‚Äù Policy Paper 2014-03, Brookings Institution, Washington, DC.[/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Chandy-and-Smith-2014.png"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Chandy-and-Smith-2014-750x474.png" alt="" width="750" height="474" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10157" /></a>

Chandy and Smith analyze all of the sources, in an attempt to faithfully replicate the the World Bank's treatment of country data for the compilation of global poverty aggregates. Their approach consists of treating the US "as if it were an anonymous developing country whose source data were submitted to the Bank". As a result of this exercise, they prioritize the Consumer Expenditure Survey, and obtain an estimate for the extreme poverty rate that is lower than 1%. This is a figure that is statistically indistinguishable from zero. 

Recently, the World Bank started publishing estimates of extreme poverty in PovcalNet (an interactive computational tool for poverty measurement developed by the Development Research Group of the World Bank). According to these figures, which were published after Chandy and Smith published their estimates, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/poverty-headcount-ratio-rich-countries?tab=chart&country=USA" target="_blank"" target="_blank"> 1% of the population in the US lived with disposable incomes below the International Poverty Line in 2013.</a> 

This means that, although consumption expenditure data is available for the US, the World Bank uses disposable income data to calculate extreme poverty figures that are not included in the global poverty estimates, due to lack of comparability.

That an estimate is 'statistically indistinguishable from zero' ‚Äì rather than 'exactly zero' ‚Äì simply reflects the fact that there is a margin of error involved in the estimation process. But what this exercise is telling us is that the margin is substantial. 

<strong>Extreme poverty in Europe</strong>

In Europe, poverty is not typically measured in absolute terms. Instead, most European countries rely on <em>relative</em> measures of poverty. This means that people are considered poor if they have less income and opportunities than other individuals living in the same society.[ref]There are two key indicators to measure poverty and social exclusion in Europe. The first one is based on the headcount of population ‚Äúat-risk-of-poverty‚Äù. This corresponds to people living in households with incomes below 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income.  The ‚Äòequivalised disposable income‚Äô refers to income after applying equivalence factors to adjust for household composition, and after taking into account social transfers and taxes.

The other key indicator relates to ‚Äòmaterial deprivation‚Äô, and measures whether households can tick certain boxes, such as having certain goods (e.g. a washing machine, a TV, etc) or living in healthy environments (e.g. absence of pollution, noise, etc.)

In the Europe 2020 strategy, one of the key objectives is to reduce poverty by lifting at least 20 million people out of "the risk of poverty or social exclusion". Here, ‚ÄúPeople at risk of poverty or social exclusion‚Äù are those in at least one of the following three conditions: "at-risk-of-poverty after social transfers, severely materially deprived or living in a household with very low work intensity." 

You can read more about poverty and material deprivation in Europe directly from <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/EU_statistics_on_income_and_living_conditions_(EU-SILC)_methodology">Eurostat</a>, where you can also find data for at-risk-of-poverty rates at different thresholds (40%, 50%, 60% and 70% of the national median equivalised household income), as well as at-risk-of-poverty rates that are 'anchored' at a point in time.[/ref]

In most cases, relative poverty is measured with respect to the median income in the corresponding country (i.e. people are poor if their income is below a certain fraction of the income of the person in the middle of the income distribution). Because of this, relative poverty is actually a metric of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/">inequality</a> ‚Äì it measures the distance between those in the middle and those at the bottom of the income distribution.

Relative poverty estimates are clearly not comparable to absolute poverty estimates published by the World Bank for low income countries. So we need to look beyond official statistics for evidence on extreme poverty in Europe.

Here, once again, we can rely on the estimates published in PovcalNet. The following visualization shows the available data for high-income countries. The map shows Western Europe, but you can choose the 'chart' tab to see all available series.

As mentioned above, these estimates show the share of population living with <em>disposable incomes </em> below the International Poverty Line (1.90 international dollars); and again, the World Bank does not include these figures in the global estimates of extreme poverty.

As we can see, the share of people living in 'World Bank type' extreme poverty in high-income European countries is very small.

This is the same result that Bradshaw and Mayhew (2011)[ref]Bradshaw, J., & Mayhew, E. (2011). The measurement of extreme poverty in the European Union.[/ref] find in a study commissioned by the European Commission, using data on per capita household incomes from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-statistics-on-income-and-living-conditions" target="_blank">EU-SILC</a> survey to measure absolute poverty rates, using a poverty line of $2.15 PPP-dollars per person per day.[ref]EU-SILC stands for European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions.[/ref] In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/extreme-poverty-EU-2008" target="_blank">this visualization</a> you can see their results; and in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/comparison-extreme-poverty-rich-countries" target="_blank">this scatter</a> plot you can see how PovcalNet estimates below compare to those by Bradshaw and Mayhew. 

Given all the evidence, we can conclude that 'World Bank type' extreme poverty is likely to be very low in rich countries, but poverty measurement instruments in these countries are not designed to capture such extreme levels of deprivation; so it is hard to know exactly how low it is.

The standard used by the World Bank to measure extreme poverty in low-income countries <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-rich-countries-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-know/" target="_blank">is not very informative in the context of high-income countries</a>. Yet, as a simple observation of the reality of homelessness suggests, there are people in rich countries living in situations of deprivation that are comparable to extreme poverty in low-income countries.

How common is homelessness in rich countries, and how does it relate to poverty?

For obvious reasons, homeless people are hard to include in income and consumption surveys, which means that it is hard to estimate the prevalence of homelessness, as well as to establish meaningful statistical comparisons between those who are poor ‚Äì as traditionally measured by consumption or income ‚Äì and those who are homeless. 

Despite the inherent difficulties, some studies have tried to shed light on these issues, by collecting information through specially-designed surveys and instruments. Here we discuss the evidence from these studies. 

<strong>How common is homelessness in rich countries?</strong>

Toro et al. (2007)[ref]Toro, P. A., Tompsett, C. J., Lombardo, S., Philippot, P., Nachtergael, H., Galand, B., ... & MacKay, L. (2007). Homelessness in Europe and the United States: A comparison of prevalence and public opinion. Journal of Social Issues, 63(3), 505-524. Available online <a href="http://www.uclep.be/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Pub/Toro_JSI_2007.pdf">here</a>.[/ref] randomly sampled and interviewed people by telephone in five different high-income countries, asking them about their experiences with homelessness. Specifically, they asked them if they had ever had an episode of literal homelessness in their life (where 'literal homelessness' means sleeping on the street or in a shelter facility). 

The visualization below shows their findings. Despite the obvious limitations with the data (telephone surveys are likely to exclude those who are homeless in the long run), we can see that homelessness is a significant issue in all these countries. In the U.K., about 1 out of 13 adults report having slept at least once on the streets or in a shelter in their lifetime. 

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-population-who-have-ever-been-homeless-2003" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

<strong> Distinguishing between poverty and homelessness</strong>

How do the 'literal homeless' compare to the 'extreme poor' who are not homeless? This is naturally a difficult question to answer. But again, researchers have tried to answer it by matching and comparing groups of individuals who fall under different categories of vulnerability. 

Toro et al. (1995),[ref]Toro, P. A., Bellavia, C. W., Daeschler, C. V., Owens, B. J., Wall, D. D., Passero, J. M., & Thomas, D. M. (1995). Distinguishing homelessness from poverty: A comparative study. Journal of consulting and clinical psychology, 63(2), 280.[/ref] for example, sampled 144 adults in the U.S., from sites such as soup kitchens that offer shelter facilities for some of the patrons, as well as shelters that offer food to poor individuals who have housing elsewhere, and constructed three roughly comparable groups: the currently homeless, the previously (but not currently) homeless, and the never-homeless but poor.

Despite the small sample sizes, they find that the never-homeless poor individuals were significantly more likely to be receiving public benefits, were less likely to have a diagnosed mental disorder or problems with substance abuse, and showed lower levels of self-rated psychological distress.

A number of other studies from the U.S. provide similar evidence, suggesting that those who are homelessness (in the sense that they are roofless or sleep in shelter facilities) tend to be a particularly vulnerable subgroup of individuals within the poor.[ref]For more information on the literature see Toro, Paul A. "Toward an international understanding of homelessness." Journal of Social Issues 63.3 (2007): 461-481.[/ref]

Of course, the data is far from perfect (small samples, potential sources of bias coming from sampling methods, etc.); but the key message here is that (i) homelessness and extreme poverty in rich countries are closely related, and (ii) you can get a sense of the magnitude of the problem by simply asking around. In a way, it seems surprising that we do not have a better idea of how high homelessness rates are among the poor in rich countries.

Understanding the link between homelessness and poverty in rich countries is important, precisely because it highlights some of the difficulties that we face when attempting to measure welfare via incomes and consumption.

As Atkinson (2016)[ref]Commission on Global Poverty. World Bank Group. Washington, DC. USA. Available online from <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25141/9781464809613.pdf">https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/</a>[/ref] recently pointed out in a report for the World Bank, the issue is that the qualitative nature of incomes and consumption, as well as the implicit degree of <em>agency</em>, should be taken into account when measuring poverty. To establish whether the homeless in rich countries are 'extreme poor', as measured relative to the International Poverty Line, we need to ask ourselves some difficult questions. Should income from begging, or food from a soup kitchen, be regarded as equal in value to a welfare check? Is money received from selling plasma (as described by Edin and Shaefer 2015[ref]Shaefer, H. L., & Edin, K. (2013). Rising extreme poverty in the United States and the response of federal means-tested transfer programs. Social Service Review, 87(2), 250-268.[/ref]) equivalent to a paycheck? 

These difficult questions underscore the importance of tracking deprivation across multiple dimensions of well-being, including both standard and non-standard economic indicators. This is our approach at Our World in Data.

How much money would we need to transfer to poor households in order to end extreme poverty? Answering this question is difficult because redistributive transfers typically entail inefficiencies. First, transfers are hard to target (it is hard to reach the desired population); and second, transfers have knock-on effects on economic behaviour (transfers change incentives and hence may affect, among other things, baseline income levels). 

One way to get a broad sense of the cost of ending poverty is hence to simplify matters, and suppose that we could rely on non-distortionary perfectly-targeted transfers: How much money would we need then to lift the incomes of all poor people up to the global poverty line of $1.90 a day?

This blog post takes this question seriously.

The short answer is that we‚Äôd need around 160 billion 'international dollars' per year to close the global poverty gap, according to 2013 figures (the latest year for which we have good data). To give you a rough idea of the order of magnitude of this number, the equivalent figure in market dollars is about 90 billion ‚Äì much less than, for example, the yearly military expenditure of the US ($600 billion as I show below).

The monetary size of the global poverty gap is of course a lower bound to the actual cost of ending poverty, since transfers are likely to entail inefficiencies and administrative costs in practice. But taking these numbers seriously is still worthwhile: they tell us that in recent years we have substantially reduced both the incidence and the <em>intensity</em> of poverty. Ending extreme poverty is very much within our reach.

<strong>What's the poverty gap and why should we care about it?</strong>

The most straightforward way to measure poverty is to set a poverty line and to count the number of people living with incomes or consumption levels below that poverty line. This is the so-called poverty headcount ratio.

Measuring poverty through the headcount ratio provides information that is straightforward to interpret; by definition, it tells us the share of the population living with consumption (or incomes) below some minimum level.

Unfortunately, measuring poverty through headcount ratios fails to capture the intensity of poverty ‚Äì individuals with consumption levels marginally below the poverty line are counted as being poor just as individuals with consumption levels much further below the poverty line.

The most common way to deal with this is to measure the intensity of poverty, by calculating the amount of money required by a poor household in order to reach the poverty line. In other words, the most common approach is to calculate the income or consumption shortfall from the poverty line.

To produce aggregate statistics, the sum of all such shortfalls across the entire population in a country (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall) is often expressed in per capita terms. This is the mean shortfall from the poverty line.

The 'poverty gap index' ‚Äì a common statistic <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GAPS" target="_blank">routinely estimated by the World Bank</a> ‚Äì takes the mean shortfall from the poverty line, and divides it by the value of the poverty line. It tells us the fraction of the poverty line that people are missing, on average, in order to escape poverty.

The poverty gap index is often used in policy discussions because it has an intuitive unit (per cent mean shortfall) that allows for meaningful comparisons regarding the relative intensity of poverty. But given that the poverty line is very low, and some countries have more poor people than others, it‚Äôs often easy to lose perspective on the actual <em>absolute</em> magnitude of the numbers we are dealing with.

Here I want to show the evolution of both the poverty gap index, and the absolute size of the poverty gap (i.e. the absolute <em>value</em>, in international dollars, of closing the poverty gap).

<strong>The poverty gap index, country by country</strong>

The following map shows the poverty gap index, country by country. As we can see, there is a clear positive correlation between the incidence of poverty and the intensity of poverty: sub-Saharan Africa,  where the share of people below the poverty line is higher, is also the region where people tend to be furthest below the poverty line.

Interestingly, the correlation is very strong, but is far from perfect. For example, India and Bolivia have relatively similar poverty gaps (mean shortfall is close to 4% of the poverty line), but they have very different poverty rates (the share of population in poverty in India is 21%, while in Bolivia it is 7.7%). This can be appreciated in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/poverty-headcount-rate-vs-poverty-gap" target="_blank">scatter plot of poverty headcount rates vs. poverty gap indices.</a> The fact that the correlation is not perfect justifies the discussion below. The intensity of poverty contains information that is not captured by the poverty headcount rate.

<strong>The cost of closing the global poverty gap</strong>

The following two visualization show the absolute yearly value of the poverty gap, for the world (top chart) and country by country (bottom chart). Estimates are expressed in international dollars (int.-$) using 2011 PPP conversion rates. This means that figures account for different prices levels in different countries, as well as for inflation.

These estimates were obtained by applying reverse engineering to the poverty gap index figures published by PovcalNet ‚Äì an interactive computational tool for poverty measurement developed by the Development Research Group of the World Bank. There is a technical note at the end of this blog post explaining the methodology in more detail.

As can be seen, the yearly cost of closing the global poverty gap today is about half of what it was a decade ago. The total amount of resources required to end extreme poverty across the world is getting smaller and smaller.

This very positive development is largely, but not exclusively driven by the remarkable improvements in China. You can read more about the 'Chinese effect' on global poverty reductions in our last blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/the-global-decline-of-extreme-poverty-was-it-only-china/" target="_blank">here</a>.

In the bottom chart, you can also explore trends country by country by clicking on the 'chart' tab. While in most cases there is a downward trend, in some countries, such as Nigeria, the size of the poverty gap has been growing. (When adding or removing countries from the chart view bear in mind that, in levels, there are huge cross-country differences; so including countries such as India will stretch the scale).

<strong>Some perspective on the cost of ending extreme poverty</strong>

The estimates above show that the yearly amount of money required to close the poverty gap is close to 160 billion int.-$. As mentioned before, this is a rough approximation of the cost of ending extreme poverty if we use efficient redistributive mechanisms.

Is this number large? The question is not trivial, since the unit is rather abstract ‚Äì international dollars are a helpful theoretical construct for cross-country comparisons, but they remain a hypothetical currency. How much is the global poverty gap in market dollars?

<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/01/20/the-global-poverty-gap-is-falling-billionaires-could-help-close-it/" target="_blank">Chandy et al. (2016)</a>[ref]Christine Zhang, Laurence Chandy, and Lorenz Noe, (2016), "The global poverty gap is falling. Billionaires could help close it." The Brookings Institution. Available online <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/01/20/the-global-poverty-gap-is-falling-billionaires-could-help-close-it/" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] answer this question, and provide a number of benchmarks.

Using the same underlying data, they find that the 160 billion int.-$ gap for 2013, amounts to about 90 billion market dollars (in 2015 prices).[ref]To be precise, Chandy et al. (2016) also use data from Povcal, but they rely on an earlier vintage, and project forward to 2015. The differences for the overlapping years (1981-2013) are however small for the purpose of global aggregates.[/ref]

So, how much are 90 billion market dollars? It‚Äôs less than the global value of foreign aid flows, estimated by Chandy et al. at around 150 billion market dollars for the same year. The visualization below shows the results from this benchmarking exercise in more detail.

Other benchmarks are also helpful to grasp the dimensions of these numbers. 90 billion market dollars are much less than, for example, the latest figure of US military spending, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.CN?locations=US" target="_blank">estimated at nearly 600 billion market dollars for 2015</a>.

90 billion market dollars is also not a huge number when compared to the net worth of billionaires. Chandy et al. compare the value of national poverty gaps to the net worth of billionaires in each country, and conclude that "In each of three countries ‚Äì Colombia, Georgia, and Swaziland ‚Äì a single individual‚Äôs act of philanthropy could be sufficient to end extreme poverty with immediate effect."

<h6>Annual cost of closing the global poverty gap, and official foreign aid, in constant 2015 market dollars, 1981-2015 ‚Äì Chandy et al. (2016)[ref]
The authors use PovcalNet data, and project forward to 2015. They note: "We first use the poverty gap to calculate a cost of filling the gap in 2011 PPP dollars, then we use PPP exchange rate ratios and the U.S. CPI to convert to market dollars. We also merge in 2015‚Äôs estimated cost & yearly foreign aid values."

&nbsp;
The poverty gap index is defined as the mean shortfall in income (or consumption) from the poverty line, expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. That means that if you multiply a country's poverty gap index by both the poverty line and the total number of individuals in the country, you get the absolute monetary value of that country's poverty gap. We constructed all estimates this way, using the International Poverty Line (1.90 int.$) and the poverty gap index estimates from the World Bank's PovcalNet data.
&nbsp;
The poverty gap index estimates from the World Bank's PovcalNet data cover low and middle income countries, with observations every three years in the period 1981-2013. To achieve this level of granularity, the World Bank relies on interpolation for countries in which survey data are not available in particular years, but are available either before or after (or both). The process of interpolation requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the missing year. You can read more about this process in <a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/methodology.aspx" target="_blank">http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/methodology.aspx</a>.
&nbsp;
It should be noted that adding the absolute monetary value of the poverty gaps across all countries with available data in Povcal, yields a global total that is slightly smaller than what Povcal reports as the global total. This is because some countries in the Middle East and North African region do not have data, but are included in the global total. <a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/WhatIsNew.aspx" target="_blank">Povcal explains this as follows</a>: "As a compromise between precision and coverage, the regional poverty totals and headcount ratios are not reported for the Middle East and North Africa, but an estimate of the number of the poor is included in the global total (based on regression-based PPPs and 2011 PPPs, depending on the country)."
&nbsp;
Finally, it is also important to note that we have found a discrepancy between the global poverty gap index reported in PovcalNet, and the global poverty gap index reported in the World Development Indicators (WDI); and this is despite the fact that WDI lists PovcalNet as its source. The discrepancy seems to stem from the reference population that is used to calculate the mean shortfall in each case.[ref]The total world population reported in the Povcal tables is not the same as the total world population reported in the World Development Indicators. However, it can be checked that for all years with data, WDI_WORLD_POVERTY_GAP_INDEX x WDI_TOTAL_WORLD_POPULATION is almost identical to POVCAL_WOLRD_POVERTY_GAP_INDEX x POVCAL_WORLD_POPULATION.[/ref]

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth" target="_blank">Economic Growth</a></strong>.</div>

Measuring economic activity in a country is difficult, since 'the economy' is a complex system with lots of moving parts. A common way to deal with this is to focus on aggregate indicators, such as total national output: "the monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country (or region) in a specific time period". That‚Äôs what economists call the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

GDP is measured using prevailing national prices to estimate the value of output. In other words, GDP is calculated using local currency units. This means that in order to make meaningful cross-country comparisons, it is necessary to translate figures into a common currency - i.e. use a consistent 'unit of measure'.

One option is to simply translate all national figures into one common currency (for instance, US dollars) using exchange rates from currency markets. But because market exchange rates do not always reflect the different price levels between countries, economists often opt for a different alternative. They create a hypothetical currency, called ‚Äòinternational dollars‚Äô, and use this as a common unit of measure. The idea is that a given amount of international dollars should buy roughly the same amount ‚Äì and quality ‚Äì of goods and services in any country.

The exchange rates used to translate monetary values in local currencies into 'international dollars' (int-$) are the 'purchasing power parity conversion rates' (also called PPP conversion factors). Below we discuss where PPP rates come from, and why they can often be more useful for comparisons than market exchange rates.

<strong>What is purchasing power and why does it matter?</strong>

Why do many British pensioners decide to move to Southern Spain? It‚Äôs not just about the weather. It also has to do with differences in price levels, which are lower in Spain than Britain. You can buy more things with one sterling pound in Southern Spain than you can in England. In other words, the <em>purchasing power</em> of the British Pound is higher in Spain than in England. This difference in price levels is exactly what PPP conversion rates try to capture.

If we are interested in living standards, any monetary income should be considered in relation to the amount of goods and services that it can buy <em>locally</em>. The same type of meal in the same type of restaurant has a different cost depending on the country where it is sold. This matters for macroeconomic comparisons and it matters for travelers: <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/money-costs" target="_blank">travel guides try to provide tourists with cross-country examples of differences in costs of living</a>, and for one very specific product it is also what <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17257797?story_id=17257797" target="_blank">the Big Mac Index</a> captures.

The following visualization shows cross-country differences in purchasing power, taking the US as the reference country. To be specific, the figures below correspond to the price level ratio of PPP conversion factors to market exchange rates. Hence, numbers below 1 imply that if you exchange 1 dollar at the corresponding market exchange rate, the resulting amount of money in local currency will buy you more in that country than you could have bought with one dollar in the US in the same year.

A price level of 0.5 shown for a country in this map means that for a given sum of US dollars you can buy twice as many goods and services in that country than in the US. In countries with a price level above 1, you can buy fewer goods and services than in the US for a given sum of US dollar.

As we can see, price level differences between developed and developing countries are much larger than those between Spain and England. The amount of goods and services that you can buy with 500 US dollars in the US is very different to what you can buy with 500 US dollars in rural India.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-price-levels-relative-to-the-us" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

This is important beyond GDP. Price level differences imply that with the same income in US dollars, you could be on the verge of poverty in the US, or fairly well-off in rural India. For this reason, we need to consider purchasing power when comparing variables such as poverty rates between countries.

From the explanation above it should be clear that we need to control for price differentials in order to meaningfully compare GDP between countries. We need a conversion factor that achieves purchasing power <em>parity</em>.

If we take an all-embracing basket of goods and services and we use it as a reference point, we can compute price indices for each country and, using statistical methods, adjust the GDP figures to deal with the problem of different price levels.

This is exactly what purchasing power parity does. It's an exercise that is done by the International Comparison Programme (ICP). ¬†<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/Deaton_Aten_Trying_to_understand_ICP_2011_V5.pdf" target="_blank">Angus Deaton explains it as follows</a>: "Purchasing power parity exchange rates, or PPPs, are price indexes that summarize prices in each country relative to a numeraire country, typically the United States. These numbers are used to compare living standards across countries, by academics in studies of economic growth, particularly through the Penn World Table, by the World Bank to construct measures of global poverty, by the European Union to redistribute resources, and by the international development community to draw attention to discrepancies between rich and poor countries."

As the graph below shows, using PPP adjusted international dollars rather than US market dollars as unit of measure can make a huge difference. When price levels in a country are much lower than in the US, using US dollars at market exchange rates will significantly underestimate the standard of living when measured through GDP per capita.

<strong>Why are differences in price levels not reflected in currency market exchange rates?</strong>

For two countries ‚Äì A and B ‚Äì the two different currencies allow for different comparisons. The market exchange rate tells you how many units of currency from country B you can buy with a unit of currency A. The purchasing power parity conversion factor, on the other hand, takes the relative prices between countries into account and allows for comparisons when you want to know how many currency units you have to spend to buy the same amount of goods and services in each of the two countries.

So, why are these two things not the same? This is not a trivial question. There are good reasons why the market exchange rate between two currencies <em>should</em> reflect the relative price levels between the two economies. Imagine that one apple costs $1 in the US and ¬£1 in the UK. Suppose the market exchange rate is not 1:1, but for example $1.5 = ¬£1. Given this situation, an American person with an apple would have an incentive to sell the apple in the UK, and then convert pounds into dollars, making a profit. This is what is called arbitrage. People would jump at such opportunities, and before long, market forces would exhaust gains from trade, leading to an equilibrium where currency prices and apple prices adjust and there are no opportunities to engage in this 'free-money game'.

The above logic, however, assumes that goods and services are tradable internationally. But in reality there are goods and services that cannot be traded internationally. If you have a house in London, you cannot export that house to the US or China. There are many other examples of non-tradable goods, such as public roads, basic services such as schooling, or even more trivial services such as hair-cuts.

The issue is that if you live in Scotland, you do not care about the price of schools in Northern Italy, or rents in Southern Spain. And this matters in the context of our discussion because prices of non-tradable goods affect the general price level of a country; but prices of non-tradable goods are determined mainly by domestic dynamics. This is one reason why we observe cross-country differences in price levels that are not mirrored by corresponding differences in currency prices.

<strong>Why do rich countries tend to have higher prices?</strong>

Empirically, we observe that prices are higher in richer countries: there is a positive cross-country relationship between average incomes and average prices. This can be seen in the visualization below, which plots GDP per capita (in international dollars) against price levels (relative to the US). This observation was formalised by Balassa and Samuelson in the 1960s, and is usually referred to as the 'Penn effect'.

Pinning down the causes behind the Penn effect is not straightforward; but economic theory provides some hints. 

One possible explanation, which has received substantial attention in the academic literature, rests on cross-country productivity differences; specifically, the fact that labour tends to be more productive in rich countries because of the adoption of more advanced technologies. 

This is the essence of the 'Balassa-Samuelson model'. The greater the productivity differentials in the production of tradable goods between countries, the larger the differences in wages and prices of services; and correspondingly, the greater the gap between purchasing power parity and the equilibrium exchange rate.  If international productivity differences are greater in the production of tradable goods than in the production of non-tradable goods, the currency of the country with the higher productivity will appear to be overvalued in terms of purchasing power parity. Therefore, the ratio of purchasing power parity to the exchange rate will be an increasing function of income.[ref]You can read more about the Balassa-Samuelson model in the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balassa%E2%80%93Samuelson_effect">Wikipedia entry</a>.

<strong>What are the main limitations of PPP adjustments?</strong>

The two last rounds of PPP factors estimated by the International Comparison Programme (ICP) are from 2005 and 2011; and the next one is scheduled for 2017. With every release, estimates improve. But the data limitations have to be kept in mind, particularly if we consider the stakes: international institutions, charities and governments rely on PPP factors in order to design policies and allocate resources internationally. 

What are the main limitations?

First, there are issues with the underlying sources used by the ICP. Many low-income countries do not collect sufficiently rich data on price levels, so the ICP often needs to impute missing values by making extrapolations based on regional averages, or by relying on data from price levels in capital cities where prices are often higher than in rural parts of the country.

And second, differences in consumption and production patterns make the identification of a common 'standard' basket of goods difficult and arbitrary. Agreeing on broad categories (e.g. 'food') is relatively easy; but narrowing down the exact items is much more complicated, since allowances have to be made for differences in factors such as product quality. Hence, the actual items that should be included in the 'standard basket' of goods produced and consumed in, say Sweden, are very different to those that should be included in Saudi Arabia.

All people living in today's world have experienced some of the benefits of globalization: the expansion of foreign trade has meant that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination/">vaccines</a> and antibiotics produced in a handful of countries have been widely used all over the world to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eradicate diseases</a> and treat deadly infections. Since 1900, life expectancy has increased in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/#life-expectancy-of-the-world-population-1800-1950-and-2012-max-roserref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every country in the world</a>, and global average life expectancy has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-globally-since-1770?shown=World" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than doubled</a>.

Globalization has also been a key driver of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth#gdp-per-capita-growth-around-the-world-since-the-year-1-ce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unprecedented economic growth</a> and as a result, we now live in a world with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#the-number-of-people-in-poverty-over-the-past-two-centuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much less poverty</a>.

Yet these achievements are the product of multiple forces, and globalization is only one of them. The increasing potential of governments to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#taxes-started-growing-in-early-industrialised-countries-after-the-first-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collect revenues</a> and redistribute resources through <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/public-spending/#social-transfers-in-oecd-countries-as-share-of-gdp-1880-1995-our-world-in-data-with-date-from-lindert-2004ref" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social transfers</a> has been another important factor contributing to improved standards of living around the world. Neither free market capitalism nor social democracy alone has been responsible for economic development. On the contrary, they often work together.

In this blog post, we discuss in more detail the evidence behind these claims.

<strong>The rise of globalization </strong>

International trade has been part of the world economy for <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thousands of years</a>. Despite this long history, the importance of foreign trade was modest until the beginning of the 19th century‚Äîthe sum of worldwide exports and imports <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade#international-trade-has-grown-remarkably-in-the-last-couple-of-centuries">never exceeded 10% of global output before 1800</a>.

Then around 1820 things started to change quickly. Around that time, technological advances and political liberalism triggered what we know today as the 'first wave of globalization'.

This first wave of globalization came to an end with the beginning of the First World War, when the decline of liberalism and the rise of nationalism led to a collapse in international trade. But this was temporary and after the Second World War, trade started growing again. This second wave of globalization, which continues today, has seen international trade grow faster than ever before. Today, around 60% of all goods and services produced in the world are shipped across country borders. (In our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Trade</a> you find more details regarding the particular features that characterize the first and second waves of globalization.)

The chart below shows the remarkable growth of foreign trade since 1800. The series shows the value of world exports in constant prices‚Äîworld exports have been indexed, so that values are relative to the value of exports in the year 1913.

The broad trend in this chart is striking: Trade followed an exponential path. Other metrics of trade, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade#international-trade-has-grown-remarkably-in-the-last-couple-of-centuries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the share of imports and exports in global output</a>, tell the same story.

In just a few generations, globalization completely changed the world economy.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-trade-exports-constant-prices" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>The correlation between globalization, economic growth and poverty reductions</strong>

In the period in which international trade expanded, the average world income increased substantially and the share of the population living in extreme poverty went down continuously.

GDP per capita is a common metric used for measuring national average incomes. By this measure, average incomes followed a similar growth pattern to international trade. For thousands of years, global GDP per capita had a negligible growth rate: technological progress in the preindustrial world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth#the-economy-before-economic-growth-the-malthusian-trap">produced people rather than prosperity</a>. Over the course of the 19th century, however, alongside the first wave of globalization, this changed substantially. In this period, economic growth started accelerating and global GDP per capita has been growing constantly over the last two centuries‚Äîwith the exception of lower growth rates during the years between the two world wars. (You can read more about these trends in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economic Growth</a>.)

Regarding extreme poverty, the available evidence shows that up until 1800, the vast majority of people around the world lived in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/">extreme deprivation</a>, with only a tiny elite enjoying higher standards of living. In the 19th century we began making progress and the share of people living in extreme poverty started to slowly decline. This trend is shown in the chart below. As we can see, today, two hundred years later, the share of people living in extreme poverty[ref]The data in the chart below measures ‚Äòextreme poverty‚Äô as defined by the World Bank; people are considered to live in extreme poverty if they have to get by with less than 1.90 ‚Äòinternational dollars‚Äô per day. International dollars are a hypothetical currency that corrects incomes for differences in price levels in different countries as well as for inflation (explained by us <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-PPPs">here</a>).[/ref] is less than 10%. This is an achievement that would have been unthinkable to our ancestors.

The stark trend in the incidence of poverty is particularly remarkable if we consider that the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/">world population increased 7-fold</a> over the same period. In a world without economic growth, such an increase in the population would have resulted in less and less consumption for everyone. And yet, as the chart shows if you switch to the 'absolute' view, the exact opposite happened: in a time of unprecedented population growth, we managed to lift more and more people out of poverty.

Living with less than 1.90 dollars per day is difficult by any standard‚Äîthe term 'extreme poverty' is appropriate. However, recent estimates show that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/no-matter-what-global-poverty-line">no matter what global poverty line you choose, the share of people below that poverty line has declined</a>. (In our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Extreme Poverty</a> you can find more evidence supporting this important historical achievement.)

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute?stackMode=relative" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>The link between globalization and absolute poverty</strong>

The fact that trade and average incomes followed similar upward trajectories in a period of unprecedented poverty reduction is of course not proof of a causal relationship. However, both evidence and theory suggest that what we observe is more than an accidental correlation.

Trade facilitates efficiency gains that are materialized in aggregate economic growth. From a conceptual point of view, international trade contributes to economic growth by allowing nations to specialize, in order to produce goods that they are relatively efficient at producing, while importing other goods. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade#how-is-trade-related-to-economic-growth">There is substantial empirical evidence backing this causal mechanism</a>.

If trade leads to growth in average incomes, what does this mean for poverty? In a much-cited 2002 academic article, David Dollar and Aart Kraay empirically showed that on average, the income of the poorest grew one-for-one with average national incomes over the last four decades of the 20th century.[ref]Dollar, David, and Aart Kraay. "Growth is Good for the Poor." Journal of economic growth 7.3 (2002): 195-225.[/ref] This means that trade has helped raise the incomes of the poor as much as it has helped raise average incomes. More recent articles have confirmed the original findings from Dollar and Kraay.[ref]See, for example, <em><a href="http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/old%20trade%20file/globalization/040200trade_pov.pdf" target="_blank">Dollar and Kraay (2004), "Trade, growth, and poverty." The Economic Journal 114.493 (2004)</a></em>;<em> and <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/651701468182332804/Growth-inequality-and-social-welfare-cross-country-evidence" target="_blank">Dollar, Kleineberg and Kraay (2014), "Growth, inequality, and social welfare : cross-country evidence." Policy Research Working Paper. </a></em>[/ref]

When taken together, the evidence thus tells us that globalization has contributed to reducing poverty around the world.

<strong>The link between globalization and inequality </strong>

That globalization is good for the poor is a statement that is true <em>on average</em>. In some countries and in some periods the poor did better than average, and sometimes they did worse.

Looking at the long-run average effect is very helpful to form an opinion regarding broad trends. However, these broad trends are not necessarily informative about how trade has affected the distribution of incomes generally; nor about how trade has affected specific groups of people in specific periods.

The same economic principles that suggest we should lend serious consideration to the efficiency gains from trade, suggest that we should do likewise for the distributional consequences from trade. If globalization generates growth by allowing countries to specialize in the production of goods that intensively use locally abundant resources, it is natural to expect that differences in the way resources are endowed will translate into differences in the way benefits are reaped.

If we take a look at the data, we observe that the process of globalization and growth that led to historical achievements in poverty reductions went along with a substantial increase in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-economic-inequality">global income inequality</a>.

The chart below shows this by comparing the global income distribution at three points in time: 1800, 1975, and 2015. We can see that the world today is both much richer and more unequal than it was in 1800.

There are two forces that can drive global <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/">income inequality</a>: within-country differences in incomes, and between-country differences in incomes. Which of the two is driving the trend we observe in this chart? The evidence suggests that it is the latter‚Äîglobal inequality increased in the period 1800-1975 because the countries that industrialized earlier grew faster.

In 1800, only a few countries had achieved economic growth while the majority of the world still lived in poverty. In the following century, more and more countries achieved sustained economic growth, and the global income distribution became much more unequal: there was a clear divergence between early-industrialized countries (where extreme forms of poverty were virtually eradicated) and the rest of the world. In the following decades and up until today, early-industrialized countries have continued growing, but the biggest changes have taken place at the bottom of the distribution. Today, global income inequality is lower than it was in 1975. But still, despite the ‚Äòcatch-up growth‚Äô in recent decades, our world today is both much richer and more unequal than it was in 1800.

So, what does the data tell us about globalization? Over the last century, the gains from international trade were substantial and generally equally distributed within countries, but global inequality increased because for a long period early-industrialized countries had larger gains to distribute among their citizens.
<h6>Global income distribution in 1800, 1975 and 2015 ‚Äì Our World in Data based on <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/tools/mountain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gapminder</a>[ref]Gapminder relies on National Accounts and within-country inequality data.

<strong>The distribution of the gains from trade</strong>

The above conclusion that globalization has not had substantial effects on global inequality may seem paradoxical to some people‚Äîthere is substantial evidence of growing inequality in many countries, including countries that have vehemently pursued trade liberalization. A notable case in point is the US, where income inequality has been on the rise in the last four decades, with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/incomes-across-the-distribution/#income-inequality-and-growth-of-living-standards-across-the-income-distribution-in-the-usa-1974-2013-brian-nolan-stefan-thewissen-and-max-roser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incomes for the bottom 10% growing much more slowly than incomes for the top 10%</a>. (You can read more about these within-country trends in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Income Inequality</a>.)

How can we reconcile these two empirical facts? In a recent article, Elhanan Helpman provides an answer informed by a meta-analysis of the available evidence: factors such as automation, technological changes, and market frictions, have contributed to the rise of inequality more than growth in international trade has.[ref]Helpman, Elhanan. Globalization and Wage Inequality. No. w22944. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2016.[/ref]

If this is the case, then why has the view that globalization is bad for the working class captured the political debate in rich countries? Part of the answer has to do with the fact that people are misinformed about the evidence. But another important reason is that, while globalization may not have been the prime cause of growing inequality within many rich countries, it remains true that there are specific groups of people who have not reaped many of the benefits from globalization in recent years.

Daniel Trefler published a paper in 2004 showing that the 1989 free trade agreement between the US and Canada temporarily increased (for about three years) the level of unemployment in Canada.[ref]Trefler, Daniel. "The long and short of the Canada-US free trade agreement." The American Economic Review 94.4 (2004): 870-895.[/ref] And David Autor and colleagues published another much cited article in 2013 showing that imports from China had diverging effects on employment across various geographical zones in the US, with employment declining more in zones where industries were more exposed to import competition from China.[ref]David, H., David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson. "The China syndrome: Local labor market effects of import competition in the United States." The American Economic Review 103.6 (2013): 2121-2168.[/ref]

These effects on specific groups are real and need to be taken into account, even if they do not imply that ‚Äòglobalization is bad for the poor‚Äô. Public policies should protect and compensate workers whose earnings are adversely affected by globalization. And as a matter of fact, public policies in rich countries have done this to some degree in the past. As painful as job losses are for the affected workers, it is thanks to unemployment benefits and other safety-net policies that we do not observe unemployment leading to widespread extreme poverty in rich countries.

<strong>Which way forward?</strong>

Has globalization been an engine of economic development? The answer is yes. Globalization has had a positive effect on economic growth, contributing to rising living standards and the reduction of extreme poverty across the world.

Can we conclude from this that we should strive for a ‚Äòhyper-globalized‚Äô world economy in which there is completely free trade with no room for public policy and regulation? The answer is no.

The point is that the worldwide historical achievements that we can attribute to globalization are not independent of other factors, including the potential of governments to redistribute resources. Indeed, as the chart below shows, the process of globalization that we have experienced in the last couple of centuries took place at the same time as governments increased their potential for taxing and redirecting resources through public policies, particularly social transfers.

How much integration in global markets would be optimal? I would be skeptical of anyone who offers a definitive answer. But it seems unlikely that the optimal degree of integration is either of the two extremes‚Äîneither ‚Äòhyper-protectionism‚Äô nor ‚Äòhyper-globalization‚Äô is likely to be the answer.

Policies aimed at liberalizing trade, and policies aimed at providing social safety nets, are often advocated by different groups, and it is common for these groups to argue that they are in conflict. But both economic theory and the empirical evidence from the successful fight against extreme poverty suggests this is a mistake: globalization and social policy should be treated as complements rather than substitutes.

In one of our most popular charts, we show that the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute?stackMode=relative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of people living in extreme poverty around the world has fallen continuously over the last two centuries</a>.

In our experience from the last couple of months, when people are presented with this empirical fact, many often say that globalization in the form of ‚Äòfree-market capitalism‚Äô is the main force to be thanked for such remarkable historical achievement. Here we want to argue that while free markets are undoubtedly important, this focus on 'free-market capitalism' alone is misguided.

Yes, over the last two centuries free markets and globalization have had a positive effect on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">aggregate economic growth</a>, contributing to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">better living conditions</a> and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/">reduction of extreme poverty across the world</a>. Yet this is far from the only important socioeconomic change and moreover, the last two centuries have not been all about 'free-market capitalism'. Governments around the world have dramatically increased their potential to collect revenues in order to redistribute resources through social transfers and raise the living standards of those that are worst off.

<strong>Larger governments</strong>

The following visualization shows the evolution of government expenditure as a share of national income for a selection of countries over the last century. The data comes from Mauro et al. (2015) and you can use the option 'Add country' to include other series.[ref]This dataset includes recent estimates for most countries in the world. However, long-run series are available mostly for OECD countries. Non-OECD countries with available long-run data include Russia, India, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Colombia.

The reach of governments has grown substantially over the last century: the share of total output that governments control is much larger today than a century ago.

In absolute terms, the growth of governments is even more striking. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth#gdp-growth-since-1950">GDP has grown substantially in the last century</a>, so most governments around the world control more resources today than ever before.

<strong>More social protection</strong>

The visualization above shows that government spending in early-industrialized countries grew substantially in the 20th century. The following visualization shows that this was the result of growth specifically in social spending.

The data presented in this visualization comes from several different sources. In the ‚Äòsources‚Äô tab you can read more about how we combined them to produce a unified series.

The main message from this chart is that the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-trade-exports-constant-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explosive process of globalization</a> that we have experienced in the last couple of centuries took place at the same time that governments increased their potential for taxing and redirecting resources through public policies, particularly social transfers.

<strong>Why should we care? </strong>

It is true that the historical reduction of extreme poverty around the world happened as markets liberalized and capitalism flourished. But it is also true that this reduction of poverty and improvement of living conditions happened at the time that public spending and redistribution to the worst off reached by far the highest levels ever.

The point we want to emphasize is that the world economy has changed in many ways in the last two centuries; and while globalization has been a key factor contributing to raising living standards across the world, its positive effects have been modulated by public policies, particularly social transfers.

This matters because policies aimed at liberalizing trade, and policies aimed at providing social safety nets, are often advocated by different groups. And it is common for these groups to argue that they are in conflict. Both economic theory and the empirical evidence from the fight against extreme poverty suggest that this is a mistake: globalization and social policy should be treated as complements rather than substitutes.";s:10:"post_title";s:79:"Historical poverty reductions: more than a story about 'free-market capitalism'";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:76:"historical-poverty-reductions-more-than-a-story-about-free-market-capitalism";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-10-02 08:48:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-10-02 07:48:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=11685";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:7;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"11701";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-05-26 12:21:30";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-05-26 11:21:30";s:12:"post_content";s:11335:"<hr style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" />

Most of the advanced economies of the world have been deindustrializing for decades and have moved into a new ‚Äòpost-industrial‚Äô phase of development. This post asks how they got there.

Although there are many idiosyncrasies in trends, the evidence shows that as rich countries developed, the relative contribution of agriculture to both total employment and GDP declined, while the contribution of services rose in both respects. In the middle, the relative importance of the manufacturing sector first expanded and then contracted. In other words, the data shows there was first a period of industrialization as production shifted from agriculture to manufacturing, followed by a period of deindustrialization as production shifted from manufacturing to services.

In this blog post we discuss this transition and the drivers of this process of ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô. 

The analysis in what follows is based mainly on a considerable update of the data provided by Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2014).[ref]Berthold Herrendorf, Richard Rogerson and Akos Valentinyi (2014) ‚Äì ‚ÄúGrowth and Structural Transformation‚Äù Handbook of Economic Growth Vol. 2B[/ref] You can read more about how we updated the data by consulting the 'Sources' tabs in the charts below.

<strong>Changes in employment </strong>

One way to study the process of ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô across countries is to track how employment changed among sectors in the economy. The following chart shows this for ten of today‚Äôs rich countries. You can change the displayed country and see that the overall picture is very consistent.

In all these countries the share of workers employed in agriculture has been going down, while the share of those employed in services has been going up; and the manufacturing sector first increases and then decreases in relative importance.

By clicking on the option labeled ‚ÄòAbsolute‚Äô, you can plot the total number of workers by sector. This shows a different picture, since we can see that the labor force in these countries has been growing substantially. As we can see, despite the fact that the share of employment in agriculture tends to go down constantly in all countries, in many cases, the total number of workers in agriculture first increases¬†and then decreases. The US is a clear example of this pattern: the total number of people employed in agriculture peaked more than a century ago around 1911, before beginning to decline.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/employment-by-economic-sector?country=USA&amp;stackMode=relative" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong> Changes in economic output</strong>

A second¬†way to study the structural transformation is to track how output changes across sectors in the economy. The following visualization shows this by plotting the evolution of the sectoral composition of GDP between 1800 and 2010 for the same rich countries included in the previous chart.

We can notice here the broad pattern outlined before: as rich countries developed, the share of GDP in agriculture declined, while the share of GDP in services went up; and in the middle, the relative importance of the manufacturing sector first expanded and then contracted. Indeed, this broad pattern is followed by all countries in the sample. (An¬†exception¬†is South Korea, where manufacturing has stabilized at around 40% of GDP since the early 1990s.)

This chart also shows us that in early industrializers such as the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, the manufacturing sector already constituted over 30% of GDP in the first half of the nineteenth century. The USA exceeded that threshold only by the end of the century, while the other ‚Äòlatecomer‚Äô economies reached it at the beginning of the twentieth century. The only exception is again South Korea, which was a largely agrarian country only 50 years ago,¬†before¬†it began an extremely rapid industrialization process‚Äîa process that has come together with a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/real-gdp-per-capita-PWT?country=KOR">30-fold increase</a> in average incomes.

When comparing the sectoral composition among countries, one must keep in mind that the way we measure these shares is important. The chart below¬†shows value added in <em>current prices,</em>¬†which means that the figures correspond to estimates of output value at the prevailing prices when output took place. The picture would however look different if we had chosen to show value added figures in <em>constant prices</em> (i.e. estimating the value of output at the prevailing prices of a fixed point in time). In the technical note at the end of this post we explain in more detail why this is. The key point to note is that in constant prices, the pattern of ‚Äòdeindustrialization‚Äô is less marked.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/shares-of-gdp-by-economic-sector" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>The forces at play</strong>

The charts above show that there is an unambiguous trend of the agricultural share of GDP and employment to fall over the course of economic development. However, this does not necessarily mean that agricultural output falls in absolute terms.

The first chart below shows data on agriculture production in Sweden. We can see that despite the process of industrialization, agricultural output increases up to 1931, after which it first falls and then stabilizes at around 760 million constant 1910/12 Swedish Krona.

Given that the share of agriculture in total employment is decreasing throughout this period, the chart below shows¬†us that labor productivity in agriculture is actually growing. In fact, in absolute terms it continues to grow even after agricultural output reaches its peak. This is shown in the second chart below, which plots the ratio between output and employment in agriculture.

A point that we need to keep in mind here is that this is an absolute increase in productivity. In relative terms the picture differs, since other sectors also increase productivity, and in fact tend to do so at a faster pace. Indeed, if we look at the charts of employment and output shares, we can see that throughout the whole period for which we have data, the share of workers in agriculture exceeds the share of agriculture in GDP. This attests to the well-documented fact that in comparison to the other sectors (i.e. in relative terms), agriculture tends to be the least productive sector in most economies.[ref]See for example Caselli, F. (2005). ‚ÄúAccounting for Cross-Country Income Differences‚Äù. Handbook of Economic Growth Vol I. pp. 679-741 ; Restuccia, D.; Yang, D.T.; Zhu, X. ‚ÄúAgriculture and aggregate productivity: A quantitative cross-country analysis‚Äù. Journal of Monetary Economics, 55(2) ; Gollin, D.; Lagakos, D.; Waugh, M. (2014). ‚ÄúThe Agricultural Productivity Gap‚Äù. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(2)[/ref]

When taken together, the evidence tells us that the story of structural transformation is not one of a stagnant agricultural sector overtaken by dynamic manufacturing and service sectors; instead, what matters are the <em>differences</em> in productivity growth between sectors. 

It is then important to keep in mind that 'deindustrialization' means that there is a loss in the relative importance of this sector. In absolute terms the industrial output might well go up as a country 'deindustrializes'; just as agricultural output might go up in absolute terms during periods of 'industrialization'. 

Alvarez-Cuadrado and Poschke (2011)[ref]Alvarez-Cuadrado, F. ; Poschke, M. (2011). ‚ÄúStructural Change Out of Agriculture: Labor Push versus Labor Pull‚Äù. American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 3(3)[/ref] show that at early stages of development, technological improvements in manufacturing are the greatest contributors to ‚Äòpulling‚Äô workers out of agriculture. At later stages, the decline in the share of consumption devoted to agricultural goods, combined with continued improvements in agricultural technology, become the predominant force in releasing workers from agriculture, further contributing to the pattern of ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô.

<div style="font-size: .7em; color: #4a3737;"><em>Technical note: </em>

The chart showing changes in the composition of GDP by sector uses current prices (i.e. figures correspond to estimates of value added at the prevailing prices when output took place). Measured this way, the changes in production values between any two years will consist of a combination of movements in prices and movements in volumes. Thus, we cannot know if the change in sectoral composition between any two years is a consequence of price changes or of more ‚Äòfundamental‚Äô structural changes.

An alternative way of measuring sectoral value added is by ‚Äòchaining‚Äô prices to those observed in a particular year, which allows us to control for changes in prices. Dividing sectoral value added by the ratio of current prices to prices in the chained year, it is possible to work out the volume of production.

Although this is a more reliable measure of the growth in productive capacity, it is difficult to use in cross-country comparisons of sectoral composition, due to the tendency of a sector to experience a decline in the price of its output as its productivity rises. Given the tendency for manufacturing to experience higher productivity growth than other sectors of the economy, and consequently for its relative price to fall over time, the implication is that the earlier the year to which we chain prices, the larger the manufacturing sector will appear to be.[ref]Dani Rodrik finds that in recent decades, the relative price of deflator of manufacturing has fallen in developed economies, in line with improvements in technology. (Rodrik, D. (2016). ‚ÄúPremature Deindustrialization‚Äù. Journal of Economic Growth, 21(1), 1-33.) This trend is not universal, however, as the same phenomenon cannot be observed in Latin America. Nevertheless, other work by Rodrik finds that manufacturing is the only sector which experiences unconditional convergence in productivity levels, implying it indeed is the fastest-growing sector. (Rodrik, D. (2013). ‚ÄúUnconditional Convergence in Manufacturing‚Äù. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 128(1), 165-204)[/ref] In fact, Rodrik (2016)[ref]Rodrik, D. (2016). ‚ÄúPremature Deindustrialization‚Äù. Journal of Economic Growth, 21(1), 1-33.[/ref] finds that in large part, the continued reduction in the current price share of manufacturing in rich countries‚Äô GDP masks the fact that when measured in real terms (ie. keeping prices constant), this share has remained fairly stable.</div>";s:10:"post_title";s:90:"Structural transformation: how did today‚Äôs rich countries become ‚Äòdeindustrialized‚Äô?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:85:"structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-11-03 09:01:02";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-11-03 09:01:02";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=11701";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:8;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"11723";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-08-16 17:30:51";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-16 16:30:51";s:12:"post_content";s:10909:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financing Healthcare</a></strong>.</div>
Today, healthcare is commonly considered a ‚Äòmerit good‚Äô‚Äîa commodity an individual should have on the basis of need rather than ability and willingness to pay. This view, mainly grounded in the recognized positive externalities of healthcare, is reflected in the fact that access to healthcare is currently a constitutional right in many countries.[ref]That healthcare should be considered a human right is nevertheless still subject of much debate. For an academic discussion of the principle of healthcare as a human right, see Smith, Richard, et al. "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114728/" target="_blank">Shared ethical principles for everybody in healthcare: a working draft from the Tavistock Group</a>." British Medical Journal 318.7178 (1999): 248.[/ref]

However, a couple of centuries ago, the situation was very different. In fact, during the Middle Ages, personal health was considered a matter of destiny across most of Western Europe.[ref]Sundin and Willner (2007) say that "[g]enerally, before the era of the Enlightenment, it was thought that health was God‚Äôs gift and disease and death was His punishment for the sins of an individual, the congregation, the whole nation or its rulers. Hence, to live a decent life in accordance with His will and repenting one‚Äôs sins were considered the most effective preventive measures against illnesses".

So, when was it that the provision of healthcare became a public policy priority? To answer this question, we piece together a new dataset and give you a behind-the-scenes look at our approach.

As we discuss below in more detail, the data shows that it was only recently that public healthcare became a policy priority. Up until 1930, public spending on healthcare was less than 1% of national incomes everywhere in the world. For context, the countries with the highest public healthcare spending levels today devote close to 10% of their national incomes to it.

<strong>Available sources</strong>

Reliable historical data on healthcare expenditure is scant. To our knowledge, the longest series on healthcare expenditure is available from Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000).[ref]Tanzi, Vito, and Ludger Schuknecht. <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kHl6xCgd3aAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Public+spending+in+the+20th+century:+A+global+perspective&amp;ots=WhdEEdxaWN&amp;sig=XJsyIdSA8C2cD-wqOFVrBCtuaY4#v=onepage&amp;q=Public%20spending%20in%20the%2020th%20century%3A%20A%20global%20perspective&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Public spending in the 20th century: A global perspective</a>. Cambridge University Press, 2000 [/ref]

Tanzi and Schuknecht compile estimates from various sources, covering the period 1880-1994.

Because the most recent observations in Tanzi and Schuknecht come from the World Bank's <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS" target="_blank">World Development Indicators (WDI)</a>, we turn to the same source to try to extend the series forward from 1995 to 2014. Unfortunately, a comparison of the WDI series and the series in Tanzi and Schuknecht reveals that this is not possible since there is a clear discrepancy in levels‚Äîthe WDI observations for 1995 imply a marked jump with respect to the 1994 observations reported by Tanzi and Schuknecht. This discrepancy arises from the fact that the World Health Organization‚Äîwhich is the underlying source of the WDI series‚Äîhas revised its methodology and estimates. Hence, the estimates compiled by Tanzi and Schuknecht are not comparable to more recent estimates from the same underlying source.

An alternative source of up-to-date data on healthcare spending is the OECD via the¬†<a href="http://stats.oecd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD.stat portal</a>. This source publishes estimates for the period 1970-2016. However once again, it is neither consistent with the World Bank series, nor with the estimates compiled by Tanzi and Schuknecht.

The discrepancies between these sources are mainly due to differences in definitions regarding the types of expenditure that are accounted for. In particular, the figures published by OECD.stat do not include capital expenditures as part of total spending on healthcare, public or private.

Whether reporting agencies include capital expenditure as part of healthcare expenditure depends on the 'System of Health Accounts' (SHA) that is in place. The OECD figures use the <a href="http://www.who.int/health-accounts/methodology/sha2011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SHA 2011</a>, which is the latest revision. The WHO figure use a previous version (<a href="http://www.who.int/health-accounts/documentation/EnglishSHA.pdf?ua=1">SHA 1.0</a>).

While it is widely accepted that the SHA 2011 is superior to previous versions, many countries still use previous versions. This means there is a trade-off between coverage across countries, and data quality. In the interest of coverage, we have chosen to rely on WHO definitions.

<strong>Piecing together a new series</strong>

Given these difficulties, we decided to piece together a new series using information from various sources based on a number of assumptions.

Our approach consisted in taking the latest release of the data from the World Health Organization (WHO), and extrapolating backwards using the rates of change implied by the sources underlying the estimates from Tanzi and Schuknecht and others.

In the end, our dataset was constructed by combining four sources. These are Lindert (1994)[ref] Lindert (1994), The Rise of Social Spending, 1880-1930, in Explorations in Economic History, 31, 1-37.[/ref], OECD (1993)[ref]OECD (1993), OECD Health Systems: facts and trends 1960-1991, Health Policy Studies n¬∞3.[/ref], <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OECD.stat</a>, and the <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WHO Global Health Expenditure Database (WHO GHED).</a>

These four sources were combined as follows.
<ul>
 	<li>For the period 1995-2015 we report the figures as published in WHO GHED.</li>
 	<li>For the period 1970-1994, we extended the recent figures (from WHO GHED) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD.stat.</li>
 	<li>For the period 1960-1969, we continue extending backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1993).</li>
 	<li>For the period 1880-1930, we report observations from Lindert (1994).</li>
</ul>
To be precise, the process of extrapolation consisted in taking the earliest available observation from WHO GHED, and then successively extending the series backwards; first by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD.stat, for the period 1970-1994; and then using the year-by-year rate of change in OECD (1993), for the period 1960-1969.[ref]Here is an example:

WHO_(year-1)= WHO_year x [OECD.stat_(year-1)]/[OECD.stat_(year)]
[/ref]

The implicit assumption in our constructed dataset is that the estimates from these three series have different levels, but common trends. Empirically, the validity of this assumption is supported by the trends in the overlapping years.

The following chart plots, country by country, the underlying sources. If you want to compare our constructed dataset against the underlying sources for a specific country, all you need to do is select the series labelled ‚ÄòOWID extrapolated series', at the top of the chart.

<strong>The rise of public healthcare </strong>

The visualization below plots our new dataset of healthcare estimates for a selection of today‚Äôs rich countries.

Public expenditure on healthcare in all of these countries followed roughly similar paths‚Äîand this is despite early differences in their healthcare regimes (for a detailed account of the institutional evolution of healthcare regimes in these countries see the <a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Social-Policy/Health/Organisational-Structure/DR4-04-ev-HC-ref.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report prepared by CESifo DICE</a>).

As we can see, before World War I, public spending on healthcare was negligible, accounting for less than 1% of national incomes in all countries. Yet in the second half of the twentieth century things started changing quickly, and today public healthcare spending is between 5-10% of national incomes.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-expenditure-share-GDP-OWID" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

The same data from the chart above is mapped in the visualization below. As we can see, after half a century of expanding their healthcare systems, OECD countries today spend much more on healthcare than lower income countries where the expansion of healthcare protection started decades later.

And the differences in healthcare spending between countries today are larger yet if we compare per capita figures, rather than shares of GDP. As we show in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/healthcare-expenditure-per-capita" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this interactive chart</a>, per capita healthcare spending in the US is 387 times higher than in the Central African Republic; which means that, on average, Americans spend more on healthcare per day than people in the Central African Republic spend per year.

The following visualization shows this for countries around the world, using data from Ipsos' <a href="http://perils.ipsos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perils of Perception</a>‚Äîa cross-country survey asking people to guess what others in their country have answered to the happiness question in the World Value Survey.

The horizontal axis in the chart below shows the actual share of people who said they are 'Very Happy' or 'Rather Happy' in the World Value Survey; the vertical axis shows the average <em>guess</em> of the same number (i.e. the average guess that respondents made of the share of people reporting to be 'Very Happy' or 'Rather Happy' in their country).

If respondents would have guessed the correct share, all observations would fall on the red 45-degree line. But as we can see, all countries are far below the 45-degree line. In other words, people in every country underestimated the self-reported happiness of others. The most extreme deviations are in Asia‚ÄîSouth Koreans think that 24% of people report being happy, when in reality 90% do.

The highest guesses in this sample (Canada and Norway) are 60%‚Äîthis is lower than the lowest actual value of self-reported happiness in any country in the sample (corresponding to Hungary at 69%).

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Happiness-of-others.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-11310" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Happiness-of-others-550x550.png" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></a>

Why do people get their guesses so wrong? It's not as simple as brushing aside these numbers by saying they reflect differences in 'actual' vs. reported happiness.

One possible explanation is that people tend to misreport their own happiness, therefore the average guesses might be a correct indicator of true life satisfaction (and an incorrect indicator of <em>reported</em> life satisfaction). However, for this to be true, people would have to commonly misreport their own happiness while assuming that others do <em>not</em> misreport theirs.

And people are not bad at judging the well-being of other people who they know: There is substantial evidence showing that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/#can-happiness-really-be-measured">ratings of one's happiness made by friends correlate with one's happiness</a>, and that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/#how-much-does-language-matter-for-cross-country-comparisons-of-happiness">people are generally good at evaluating emotions from simply watching facial expressions</a>.

An alternative explanation is that this mismatch is grounded in the well-established fact that people tend to be positive about themselves, but negative about other people they don't know.¬†It has been observed in other contexts that people can be optimistic about their own future, while at the same time being deeply pessimistic about the future of their nation or the world. We discuss this phenomenon in more detail in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/optimism-pessimism/">optimism and pessimism</a>, specifically in a section dedicated to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/optimism-pessimism/#individual-optimism-and-social-pessimism">individual optimism and social pessimism</a>.";s:10:"post_title";s:71:"Collective pessimism and our inability to guess the happiness of others";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:71:"collective-pessimism-and-our-inability-to-guess-the-happiness-of-others";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-09-11 18:20:53";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-09-11 17:20:53";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=12042";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:10;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"12044";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-06-17 16:04:01";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-06-17 15:04:01";s:12:"post_content";s:4447:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.

In global surveys of happiness and life satisfaction, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Germany usually ranks high</a>. However, these national averages mask large inequalities. In the map below we focus on regional inequalities‚Äîspecifically the gap in life satisfaction between West and East Germany.

The map below plots self-reported life satisfaction in Germany (using the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/#is-life-satisfaction-the-same-as-happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0-10 Cantril Ladder question</a>), aggregating averages scores at the level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal States</a>.[ref]In some cases, the underlying data had multiple average estimates for the same territory (e.g. Baden and W√ºrttemberg were treated as different entities). In these cases the map shows the average between these two observations. Details can be found in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-data.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this file</a>[/ref] The first thing that stands out is a clear divide between the East and the West, along the political division that existed before the reunification of Germany in 1990.
For example, the difference in levels between neighboring Schleswig-Holstein (in West Germany) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in East Germany) are similar to the difference between <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder">Sweden and the US</a> ‚Äì a considerable contrast in self-reported life satisfaction.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-Gluecksatlas.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11335" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-Gluecksatlas-379x550.png" alt="" width="500" height="725.6" /></a>
Several academic studies have looked more closely at this 'happiness gap' in Germany using data from more detailed surveys, such as the German Socio-Economic Panel (e.g. Petrunyk and Pfeifer 2016).[ref]Petrunyk, I., &amp; Pfeifer, C. (2016). Life satisfaction in Germany after reunification: Additional insights on the pattern of convergence. Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik, 236(2), 217-239.[/ref] These studies provide two main insights:

First, the gap is partly driven by differences in household income and employment. But this is not the only aspect; even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic differences, the East-West gap remains significant.

And second, the gap has been narrowing in recent years. In fact, the finding that the gap is narrowing is true both for the raw average differences, as well as for the 'conditional differences' (i.e. the differences that are estimated after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics). The following charts shows this.

The observation that socioeconomic and demographic differences do not fully predict the observed East-West differences in self-reported happiness is related to a broader empirical phenomenon: Culture and history matter for self-reported life satisfaction‚Äîand in particular, ex-communist countries tend to have a lower subjective well-being than other countries with comparable levels of economic development.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happiness and Life Satisfaction</a></strong>.</div>
The General Social Survey (GSS) in the US is a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of about 1,500 respondents each year since 1972, and is an important source of information on long-run trends of self-reported life satisfaction in the country.[ref]The GSS asks people a very similar question to the World Value Survey: ‚ÄúTaken all together, how would you say things are these days‚Äîwould you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?‚Äù[/ref] As such, it is a key indicator of happiness in the US.

Using this source, Stevenson and Wolfers (2008)[ref]Stevenson, Betsey, and Justin Wolfers. "Happiness inequality in the United States." The Journal of Legal Studies 37.S2 (2008): S33-S79. An ungated earlier version of the paper is available <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/35143/1/576953326.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] show that while average happiness in the US has remained broadly constant, <em>inequality</em> in happiness has fallen substantially in recent decades.

The authors further note that this is true both when we think about inequality in terms of the dispersion of answers, and also when we think about inequality in terms of gaps between demographic groups. They note that two-thirds of the black-white happiness gap has been eroded (although today white Americans remain happier on average, even after controlling for differences in education and income), and the gender happiness gap has disappeared entirely (women used to be slightly happier than men, but they are becoming less happy, and today there is no statistical difference once we control for other characteristics).[ref]These results have been discussed in various blogs. Freakonomics provides a quick and interesting overview of the debate, specifically with regard to <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2007/10/01/why-are-women-so-unhappy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender gaps</a>.[/ref]

Curiously, these reductions in 'happiness inequality' have taken place alongside growing income inequality. As the following chart shows, income inequality in the US is exceptionally high and has been on the rise in the last four decades, with incomes for the median household growing much more slowly than incomes for the top 10%. (More on this data in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/incomes-across-the-distribution/">our entry on incomes across the income distribution</a>.)
<h6>Income inequality (Gini coefficient) and growth of living standards across the income distribution (by decile) in the USA, 1974-2013¬†‚Äì <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/incomes-across-the-distribution/#the-us-incomes-for-most-households-stagnate-inequality-increases-constantly">Brian Nolan, Stefan Thewissen, and Max Roser</a></h6>

The results from Stevenson and Wolfers for the US are consistent with other studies looking at changes in happiness inequality (or life satisfaction inequality) in different countries. In particular, researchers have noted that there is a correlation between economic growth and reductions in happiness inequality‚Äîeven when <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/">income inequality</a> is increasing at the same time. The visualization below, from Clark, Fleche and Senik (2015)[ref]Clark, Andrew E., Sarah Fl√®che, and Claudia Senik. "Economic growth evens out happiness: Evidence from six surveys." Review of Income and Wealth (2015). An ungated earlier version of the paper is available <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/60530/1/dp1306.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>[/ref] shows this. It plots the evolution of happiness inequality within a selection of rich countries that experienced uninterrupted GDP growth.

In this chart, happiness inequality is measured by the dispersion‚Äîspecifically the standard deviation‚Äîof answers in the World Value Survey. As we can see, there is a broad negative trend; happiness inequality is falling in countries where GDP per capita is rising. And the opposite is also true: In their paper the authors show that happiness inequality is increasing in those countries and times when GDP is falling.

So: Why could it be that happiness inequality falls with rising income inequality?

Clark, Fleche, and Senik argue that part of the reason is that the growth of national income allows for the greater provision of public goods, which in turn tighten the distribution of subjective well-being. This can still be consistent with growing income inequality, since public goods such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/">better health</a> affect incomes and well-being differently.

Another possibility is that economic growth and social change in rich countries has translated into a more diverse society in terms of cultural expressions (e.g. through the emergence of alternative lifestyles), which has allowed people to converge in happiness even if they diverge in incomes, tastes and consumption. Steven Quartz and Annette Asp explain this hypothesis in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/unequal-yet-happy.html?smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times article</a>, discussing evidence from experimental psychology.";s:10:"post_title";s:64:"Income inequality and happiness inequality: a tale of two trends";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:66:"happiness-and-income-inequality-often-move-in-different-directions";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-01-17 03:53:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-01-17 03:53:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=12051";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:12;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"12109";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-06-14 01:33:52";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-06-14 00:33:52";s:12:"post_content";s:2733:"You can reproduce all interactive visualizations from Our World In Data in presentations and other documents, such as PowerPoint or LaTeX slides.

This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Life Expectancy</a></strong>.</div>

The interactive chart below shows that life expectancy has increased substantially around the world in the last couple of centuries. As a matter of fact, the data tells us that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/#life-expectancy-increased-in-all-countries-of-the-world">in the long run life expectancy has increased in all countries around the world</a>.

Life expectancy is one of the key measures of a population‚Äôs health, and an indicator used widely by policymakers and researchers to complement economic measures of prosperity, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth">GDP per capita</a>. It is easy to see that the trends in the chart below are a fantastic achievement reflecting <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta/">widespread improvements in global health</a>.


However, despite its importance and prominence in research and policy, it is surprisingly difficult to find a simple yet detailed description of what ‚Äúlife expectancy‚Äù actually means. In this blog post, we try to fill this gap.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?country=BRA+ETH+DEU+IND+JPN+KOR+GBR" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>What is life expectancy and how is it interpreted?</strong>

The term "life expectancy" refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die.

In theory, estimating age-at-death is a simple exercise. Suppose we could track a group of people born a given year, many decades ago, and observe the exact date in which each one of them died. Then, we could estimate this cohort's life expectancy by simply calculating the average of the ages of all members when they died.

In practice, however, things are often more complicated because record-keeping is insufficient, and because we are interested in making inferences about how long a group of people can expect to live in the future. Hence, estimating life expectancy typically requires making assumptions.

One common approach is to track members of a particular cohort (i.e. a group of individuals born in a given year) and predict the average age-at-death for them using a combination of observed mortality rates for past years and projections about mortality rates for future years. This approach leads to what is known as '<strong>cohort life expectancy</strong>'. By definition, the cohort life expectancy takes into account observed and projected improvements in mortality for the cohort throughout its lifetime.

An alternative approach consists in estimating the average length of life for a <em>hypothetical</em> cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year. This approach leads to what is known as '<strong>period life expectancy</strong>' and is the definition used by most international organizations, including the UN and the World Bank, when reporting 'life expectancy' figures. Period life expectancy estimates do not take into account how mortality rates are changing and instead only look at the mortality pattern at one point in time. Because of this, period life expectancy figures are usually different to cohort life expectancy figures.

Since period life expectancy estimates are ubiquitous in research and public debate, it is helpful to use an example to flesh out the concept. Let's consider the visualization below, which maps life expectancy‚Äîspecifically period life expectancy‚Äîat birth, country by county. You can hover the mouse over a country to display the corresponding estimate.

For the US, we can see that life expectancy in 2005 was 77.6 years. This means that the cohort of infants born in the US in 2005 could expect to live 77.6 years, under the assumption that mortality patterns observed in 2005 remain constant throughout their lifetime. This is clearly a strong assumption‚Äîif you move the slider forward in the chart below, you'll see that in 2010 the period life expectancy in the US was 78.8 years, which means that US mortality patterns did improve in the period 2005-2010.

In general, the commonly-used period life expectancies tend to be lower than the cohort life expectancies, because they do not include any assumptions about future improvements in mortality rates.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?tab=map&amp;year=2005" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

An important point to bear in mind when interpreting life expectancy estimates is that very few people will die at precisely the age indicated by life expectancy, even if mortality patterns stay constant.

For example, very few of the infants born in South Africa in 2009 will die at 52.2 years of age, as per the figures in the map above. Most will die much earlier or much later, since the risk of death is not uniform across the lifetime. Life expectancy is the average.

In societies with high infant mortality rates many people die in the first few years of life; but once they survive childhood, people often live much longer. Indeed, this is a common source of confusion in the interpretation of life expectancy figures: It is perfectly possible that a given population has a low life expectancy at birth, and yet has a large proportion of old people.

Given that life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life, it is common to report life expectancy figures at different ages, both under the period and cohort approaches. For example, the UN estimates that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-at-age-10?country=OWID_WRL">the (period) global life expectancy at age 10 in 2005 was 63.6 years</a>. This means that the group of 10-year-old children alive around the world in 2005 could expect to live another 63.6 years (i.e. until the age of 73.6), provided that mortality patterns observed in 2005 remained constant throughout their lifetime.

Finally, another point to bear in mind is that period and cohort life expectancy estimates are statistical measures, and they do not take into account any person-specific factors such as lifestyle choices. Clearly, the length of life for an average person is not very informative about the predicted length of life for a person living a particularly unhealthy lifestyle.

<strong>How is life expectancy calculated?</strong>

In practical terms, estimating life expectancy entails predicting the probability of surviving successive years of life, based on observed age-specific mortality rates. How is this actually done?

Age-specific mortality rates are usually estimated by counting (or projecting) the number of age-specific deaths in a time interval (e.g. the number of people aged 10-15 who died in the year 2005), and dividing by the total observed (or projected) population alive at a given point within that interval (e.g. the number of people aged 10-15 alive on 1 July 2015).

To ensure that the resulting estimates of the probabilities of death within each age interval are smooth across the lifetime, it is common to use mathematical formulas, to model how the force of mortality changes within and across age intervals. Specifically, it is often assumed that the proportion of people dying in an age interval starting in year [latex]x [/latex] and ending in year [latex]n+x[/latex] corresponds to [latex] q(n,x)=1-e^{n * m(n,x)}[/latex], where [latex]m(n,x)[/latex] is the age-specific mortality rate as measured in the middle of that interval (a term often referred to as the 'central death rate' for the age interval).[ref]The underlying assumption is that the force of mortality is constant within each age interval. The seminal reference introducing this method is Fergany (1971) "On the Human Survivorship Function and Life Table Construction," Demography8(3):331-334).[/ref]

Once we have estimates of the fraction of people dying across age intervals, it is simple to calculate a 'life table' showing the evolving probabilities of survival and the corresponding life expectancies by age. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Example-Life-Table-US.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is an example of a life table from the US</a>, and <a href="https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/training/online-courses-and-resources/non-certificate-courses-and-mini-tutorials/multiple-decrement-life-tables/lesson-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial from MEASURE Evaluation</a> explains how life tables are constructed, step by step (see Section 3.2 'The Fergany Method').

Period life expectancy figures can be obtained from 'period life tables' (i.e. life tables that rely on age-specific mortality rates observed from deaths among individuals of different age groups at a fixed point in time). And similarly, cohort life expectancy figures can be obtained from 'cohort life tables' (i.e. life tables that rely on age-specific mortality rates observed from tracking and forecasting the death and survival of a group of people as they become older).

For some countries and for some time intervals, it is only possible to reconstruct life tables from either period or cohort mortality data. As a consequence, in some instances‚Äîfor example in obtaining <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-globally-since-1770">historical estimates of life expectancy across world regions</a>‚Äîit is necessary to combine period and cohort data. In these cases, the resulting life expectancy estimates cannot be simply classified into the 'period' or 'cohort' categories.

<strong>What else can we learn from 'life tables'?</strong>

Life tables are not just instrumental to the production of life expectancy figures (as noted above), they also provide many other perspectives on the mortality of a population. For example, they allow for the production of 'population survival curves', which show the share of people who are expected to survive various successive ages. The below chart provides an example, plotting survival curves for individuals born at different points in time, using cohort life tables from England and Wales.

At any age level in the horizontal axis, the curves in the chart below mark the estimated proportion of individuals who are expected to survive that age. As we can see, less than half of the people born in 1851 in England and Wales made it past their 50th birthday. In contrast, more than 95% of the people born in England and Wales today can expect to live longer than 50 years.

Since life expectancy estimates only describe averages, these indicators are complementary, and help us understand how health is distributed across time and space. In our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">Life Expectancy</a> you can read more about related complementary indicators, such as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/#median-age-by-country">median age of a population.</a>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In almost every country in the world, men are more likely to participate in labor markets than women. However, these gender differences in participation rates have been narrowing substantially in recent decades. In this post we discuss how and why these changes are taking place.

The first section in this article provides an overview of the 'stylized facts', including an overview of women's participation in the informal economy and unpaid care work. The second section provides an overview of the key factors that have been driving the broad trends (these factors are further discussed in a <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants">companion blog post</a>).

Before we move on to the details, here is a preview of the main points:

<ul>
	<li>In most countries men tend to participate in labor markets more frequently than women.</li>
	<li>All over the world, labor force participation among women of working age increased substantially in the last century.</li>
	<li>In some parts of the world, the historical increase in female labor force participation has slowed down or even regressed slightly in recent years.</li>
	<li>Women all over the world allocate a substantial amount of time to activities that are not typically recorded as ‚Äòeconomic activities‚Äô. Hence, female participation in labor markets tends to increase when the time-cost of unpaid care work is reduced, shared equally with men, and/or made more compatible with market work.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Stylized Facts</h3>

<h4>The global picture</h4>

Around the world men tend to participate in labor markets more frequently than women. However, it only takes a glimpse of the data to see that there are huge differences across societies.

The following visualization provides a picture of how men and women compare today in terms of participation in labor markets, country by country. Shown is the female-to-male ratio in labor force participation rates (expressed in percent). These figures show estimates from the International Labor Organization (ILO). These are 'modelled estimates' in the sense that the ILO produces them after harmonizing various data sources to improve comparability across countries.

As we can see, the numbers for most countries are well below 100%, which means that the participation of women tends to be lower than that of men. Yet differences are outstanding: in countries such as Syria or Algeria, the ratio is below 25%. In contrast, in Laos, Mozambique, Rwanda, Malawi and Togo, the relationship is close to, or even slightly above 100% (i.e. there is gender parity in labor force participation or even a higher share of women participating in the labor market than men).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation-rates-ILO-WDI" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Female labor force participation is highest in some of the poorest and richest countries in the world. And it is lowest in countries with average national incomes somewhere in between. In other words: in a cross-section, the relationship between female participation rates and GDP per capita follows a U-shape. This is shown in the scatter plot below.

To highlight continents, you can click on the continent name tags on the right panel. If you do this you will see that some interesting patterns emerge. Within Africa there is a negative correlation (the poorest countries have the highest participation rates), while in Europe there is a positive correlation (the richest European countries have the highest participation rates). Indeed, these correlations within high and low income countries seem to explain a big part of the U-shape that appears in the cross-section.

In the last section of this blog post we provide an overview of the forces that drive this correlation, borrowing from our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">companion blog post</a> on the determinants of female labor force participation.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-by-national-per-capita-income" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

In terms of changes across time, the female labor force participation rate today is higher than three decades ago. This is true in the majority of countries, across all income levels. The chart below shows this, comparing national estimates of female participation rates in 1980 (vertical axis) and 2016 (horizontal axis).[ref] Shown are the ILO's 'non-modelled' estimates, which have a higher margin of error but are available for a longer period. Whenever a country had missing data for 1980 or 2016, the closest year with available data is shown (within a 5-year window). For reference, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-rates-slopes">This slope chart</a> plots the same dataset, but only for countries with observations on 1980 and 2016.[/ref]

The grey diagonal line in this scatter plot has a slope of one, so countries that have seen positive changes in female labor force participation rates appear below the line. As we can see, most countries lie on the bottom right. Indeed, in some cases, countries are very far below the diagonal line‚Äîin Nicaragua, for example, there was a five-fold increase over the period.

On the aggregate, what does this imply for the global trend? The answer is not obvious, since some countries have missing data, and global trends are particularly sensitive to changes in large countries, such as India. In a recent exercise using statistical assumptions to impute missing data, the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/Complete-Report.pdf" target="_blank">World Development Report (2012) </a> estimates that in the period 1980-2008, the global rate of female labor force participation increased from 50.2 to 51.8 percent, while the male rate fell slightly from 82.0 to 77.7 percent. So the gender gap narrowed from 32 percentage points in 1980 to 26 percentage points in 2008.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-2015-vs-1980" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

An important point to note is that the chart above includes all women above 15 years of age. This means that the trends conflate changes across different population sub-groups (e.g. young women, married women, older women above retirement age, etc.). Indeed, group-specific trends do not always follow the overall trends. Specifically, trends in labor force participation among younger women are often different to the aggregate trends, notably in rich countries where participation expanded mostly among the older, often married female population. In many countries the historical increase in female labor force participation took place together with a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/labor-force-participation-rates-for-women-ages-15-24-2016-vs-1980">reduction in participation among younger women</a>, because expansion was driven by women entering labor markets only after attending higher education. We discuss this in more detail below.

<h4>Some historical perspective</h4>
The 20th century saw a radical increase in the number of women participating in labor markets across early-industrialized countries. The following visualization shows this. It plots long-run female participation rates, piecing together OECD data and available historical estimates for a selection of early-industrialized countries.

As we can see, there are positive trends across all of these countries. Notably, growth in participation began at different points in time, and proceeded at different rates; nonetheless, the substantial and sustained increases in the labor force participation of women in rich countries remains a striking feature of economic and social change in the 20th century.[ref]Comparable historical estimates showing a breakdown of participation rates by age groups show that this increase took place across almost all individual age groups (see, for example, Heckman J. and Killingsworth M. (1986) Female Labor Supply: A Survey. in Handbook of Labor Economics, Volume I, Edited by O. Ashenfelter and R. Layard)[/ref]

However, this chart also shows that in many rich countries ‚Äì such as, for example, the US ‚Äì growth in participation slowed down considerably or even stopped at the turn of the 21st century.[ref]The recent decline in female labor force participation in the US has received attention in a number of recent academic studies. Importantly, <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_katz_wwl_nber_wp22607.pdf" target="_blank">Goldin &amp; Katz (2016)</a> show that the overall trend of decreasing female participation in the US masks important cohort trends. In particular, they show that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-10.57.32.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a large share of American women are working much longer today than previous generations</a> ‚Äî well into their 60s and 70s ‚Äî and working full-time.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-OECD" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

What do we know about the characteristics of the women who drove this remarkable historical expansion of female labor force participation in rich countries? As it turns out, the evidence shows that most of the long-run increase in the participation of women in labor markets throughout the last century is attributable specifically to an increase in the participation of married women.

As an example, the following visualization shows female labor force participation rates in the US, differentiated by marital status. As we can see, the marked upward trend observed for the general female population is mainly driven by the trend among married women. Heckman and Killingsworth (1986) provide evidence of similar historical trends for the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LFP-UK-Married-Women-Heckman-and-Killingsworth-1986-.png">UK</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LFP-Germany-Married-Women-Heckman-and-Killingsworth-1986-.png">Germany</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LFP-Canada-Married-Women-Heckman-and-Killingsworth-1986-.png">Canada</a>.[ref]Heckman J. and Killingsworth M. (1986) Female Labor Supply: A Survey. in Handbook of Labor Economics, Volume I, Edited by O. Ashenfelter and R. Layard)[/ref]
<h6>Labor force participation of women in the US, by marital status ‚Äì Engemann &amp; Owyang (2006)[ref]Engemann, K. M., &amp; Owyang, M. T. (2006). Social changes lead married women into labor force. The Regional Economist, (Apr), 10-11.[/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Labor-Force-Participation-of-women-in-the-US-1955-2005.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13213" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Labor-Force-Participation-of-women-in-the-US-1955-2005-750x415.png" alt="" width="750" height="415" /></a>

The charts above provide evidence regarding the expansion of female labor supply via higher participation rates. But this is of course only one way of measuring market supply. What about the number of hours worked? This is a relevant question since working hours for the general population <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/productivity-vs-annual-hours-worked?stackMode=absolute&amp;time=1950..2014">decreased substantially in rich countries as they increased their productivity throughout the 20th century</a>.

The following chart provides some clues. It shows several decades of changing average weekly hours worked for women in a selection of OECD countries. As we can see, most countries show negative trends, which is consistent with the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/work-hours-per-week?country=AUS+BEL+CAN+DNK+FRA+DEU+IRL+ITA+NLD+ESP+SWE+CHE+GBR+USA">trends for the population as a whole</a>. However, some of these trends are still remarkable if we take into account the substantial increase in female participation taking place at the same time.

Consider the case of Spain: in the period 1987-2016, weekly work in a main job decreased from about 39 hours, to about 35 hours; while participation rates for women increased from 32% to 54% in the same period.

This is an important pattern: at the same time as more women in rich countries started participating in labor markets, there was often a reduction in the average number of hours that women spent at work. In economics lingo: the 20th century witnessed a large increase in supply of female labor along the extensive margin (number of workers), together with some reductions along the intensive margin (hours worked per worker).

Available evidence shows that the effect along the extensive margin was much stronger. So in these countries there was an increase in the sum of female worker hours ‚Äì that is, the total yearly hours worked per female worker increased across all female workers.[ref]Another way of saying this is that the reduction in hours worked per female worker did not offset the strong effect of the increase in number of female workers. But a technical note regarding 'cohort' vs 'period' effects is relevant here. The issue is that the decline in weekly hours worked may be at least partly a consequence of the addition of "low-hours" women <em>within</em> each cohort, rather than a reduction of hours worked <em>across</em> cohorts. This may well be the case, since a large part of the increase in participation was driven by new part-time employment opportunities (e.g. because of greater availability of jobs with flexible hours). Heckman and Killingsworth (1986) provide evidence suggesting that successive cohorts of women in rich countries generally did supply steadily increasing amounts of labor throughout most of the 20th century ‚Äì and this is true for various definitions of "labor supply", including participation in the labor force, employment and 'total work per capita' (i.e. the product of the employment rate and weekly hours worked by working women). [/ref]

<h4>Recent developments</h4>
In the beginning of the post we point out that since 1980, female participation in labor markets has increased in most countries; yet according to the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/Complete-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 World Development Report</a> the global trend only increased slightly over the same period ‚Äì from 50.2% to 51.8%.

If we focus on more recent developments, the ILO estimates show that the global trend is actually negative, mainly because of important reductions in some world regions. This is shown in the visualization below.

As we can see, regional trends in recent years go in different directions. Notably, there have been large reductions in South and East Asia, and large increases in Latin America. In the Middle East and North Africa there have also been positive trends, but this remains the region where female participation rates are lowest.

<h4>Working women vs. Women in the labor force</h4>
<strong>A taxonomy of labor supply</strong>

Before we move on to explore the determinants of female participation in labor markets, it is important that we dig deeper into the concepts. We have already said that labor force participation is defined as being ‚Äòeconomically active‚Äô. But what does that <em>actually</em> mean? Being able to answer this question is crucial to understanding changes in female participation in labor markets, since women typically invest time on productive activities that do not count as ‚Äòmarket labor supply‚Äô.

From a conceptual point of view, people who are economically active are those who are either employed (including part-time employment starting from one hour a week) or unemployed (including anyone looking for job, even if it is for the first time). Students who do not have a job and are not looking for one, are not economically active.

In the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines stipulated by the ILO</a>, 'employment' also includes self-employment, which means that in principle, the labor force includes anyone who supplies labor for the production of economic goods and services, independently of whether they do so for pay, profit or family gain. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-13-at-11.21.39.png">This chart from the ILO</a> shows an overview of what counts and what doesn‚Äôt towards producing 'economic goods and services'.[ref]The classification follows the standards set in the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/SNA2008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2008 System of National Accounts.</a> The linked chart is from Castillo M. (2011). Labour Force Framework: Concepts Definitions, Issues and Classifications. ILO Department of Statistics ‚Äì Geneva. Available online <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---americas/---ro-lima/---sro-port_of_spain/documents/presentation/wcms_304686.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref]

Loosely speaking, the guidelines stipulate that unpaid activities should be excluded if they lead to services or goods produced and consumed within the household (and they are not the prime contribution to the total consumption of the household).[ref]Interestingly, note that activities are not excluded on the grounds that they are illegal or registered with public authorities.[/ref] This often means excluding unpaid work on things like "Preparation and serving of meals"; "Care, training and instruction of children"; or "Cleaning, decorating and maintenance of the dwelling". The implication, then, is that even if the guidelines are followed closely to include all possible forms of economic activities, even in the informal sector, there will still be an important number of 'working women' who are excluded from the labor force statistics. And these exclusions are even more salient if we consider that in many countries actual measurement deviates from the guidelines.

In many countries with poor capacity to produce national statistics, labor force participation is measured from population censuses, rather than from labor force surveys especially designed for that purpose.[ref]The statistical series labeled as "ILO modeled" try to overcome some of these limitations by harmonizing the national estimates, to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors. The modeled estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available. You can read more about this in the ‚ÄòSources‚Äô tab of the charts; specifically in the section 'limitations and exceptions'.[/ref] The consequence of this is that labor force statistics often exclude individuals who should be covered by the definitions above. Among the most important exclusions are workers engaged in unpaid work.[ref] It is important to note that unpaid work is not the same as informal work. The ILO standards do recommend including informal workers (both paid and unpaid) under the economically active population. In practice, however, data collection typically focuses on paid informal employment, mainly outside agriculture. This means that labor force statistics often do include self-employed workers in their own informal enterprises (e.g. street food vendors), as well as persons in informal employment relationships in formal enterprises (e.g. workers hired by formal enterprises without a formal contract). But they often fail to include unpaid work on activities such as subsistence farming.[/ref]

Given all of this, it is natural to wonder if the 'key facts' would look different if we used an alternative definition of labor supply. Let's try to break down the figures to understand any relevant differences between 'labor supply' and other notions of 'work'.

<strong>Breaking down the numbers</strong>

The first and most obvious line splitting the economically active population in a country is employment. The chart below plots female employment-to-population ratios across the world (national estimates before ILO corrections). These figures show the number of employed women as a share of the total female population (in both cases, for women ages 15 or older).

To emphasize, here we are leaving aside unemployment, and we are focusing on trends for employed women ‚Äì who are, by definition a subset of the whole economically active population.

As we can see, the trends are consistent with those for labor force participation: In the period 1980-2016, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-to-population-ratio-2015-vs-1980">the majority of countries saw an increase in the share of women who are employed</a>. This is what we would expect ‚Äì it means that, by and large, the participation of women in the labor market was driven by employment, rather than unemployment.

(<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/modeled-female-employment-to-population-ratio?tab=chart">This chart</a> shows the same variable but using ILO modeled estimates. These provide a shorter time perspective, but are more accurate and complete.)

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-to-population-ratio" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Let us turn now to informal employment. As we mentioned above, the ILO guidelines stipulate that labor participation should include informal employment. So this is another important line that, in principle, cuts across the economically active population.

The first point to note is that, despite the guidelines, in practical terms work in the informal sector is not always reflected in labor statistics due to measurement issues. So an empirical study of economically active women in the informal sector remains a challenge. Nevertheless, some progress has been made on this front, and today many countries do report disaggregated figures for some forms of informal employment, mainly those relating to paid work in non-agricultural economic activities. (You can read more about measurement and definitions of informal employment in the ILO report <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_234413.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Women and Men in the Informal Economy: A Statistical Picture"</a>.) The chart below shows these estimates.

The bars corresponds to the share of women employed in the informal economy, as a share of all women who are employed in non-agricultural economic activities. Years differ from country to country, and there is unfortunately still insufficient data to explore time trends. However, as we can see, the data does show that a large part of female employment around the world takes place in the informal economy. In fact, in many low and middle income countries, the vast majority of women engaged in paid work are in the informal economy. For women in Uganda, for example, almost 95% of paid work outside agriculture is informal. In Greece, the corresponding figure is close to 4%.

In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/male-vs-female-informal-employment-as-share-of-total-employment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this interactive data visualization</a> you can see how the figures below compare to those for men. The data suggests that in the majority of countries, women tend to work in the informal economy more often than men. And it is likely that this gender difference would be larger if we accounted for the informal agricultural economy, for which data is not available. This is important because national sources of protection and support ‚Äì as well as legal and policy frameworks ‚Äì tend to favor formal workers.[ref]Formal workers are favored through, for example: sectoral policies, infrastructure services, social protection, childcare and occupational safety systems, and institutions for collective bargaining.

Let us now have a look at unpaid work. As we have noted, domestic unpaid care work is an important activity which women tend to spend a significant amount of time on ‚Äì and it is an activity that is typically unaccounted for in labor supply statistics. In the following chart we show just how skewed the gender distribution of unpaid care work in the household is.

The bars show the female-to-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid services provided within the household, including care of persons, housework and voluntary community work. You can add countries using the button labeled 'Add Country'. And you can click on the 'Map' tab to get a cross-country overview.

As we can see, gender differences in time devoted to unpaid care work cut across societies: All over the world, women spend more time than men on these activities. Yet there are clear differences when it comes to the magnitude of these gender gaps. At the low end of the spectrum, in Uganda women work 18% more than men in unpaid care activities at home. While at the opposite end of the spectrum, in countries such as India, women work 10 times more than men on these activities.

In the MENA region, where the gap tends to be largest, women spend on average over 5 hours on unpaid care work per day, while men spend less than one hour.[ref]OECD (2014) Unpaid Care Work:The missing link in the analysis of gender gaps in labour outcomes.

<h3>The forces driving change</h3>
To recap: women all over the world allocate a substantial amount of their time to activities that are not typically recorded as ‚Äòeconomic activities‚Äô. What does this tell us about time allocation and labor supply more generally? The answer is perhaps unsurprising. Female participation in labor markets tends to increase when the time-cost of unpaid care work is reduced, shared equally with men, and/or made more compatible with market work.

You can find more details about the determinants of female labor supply in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">companion blog post</a>. Here we provide a quick overview of the key 'drivers'.

<strong>Maternal health </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The various aspects related to maternity impose a substantial burden on women‚Äôs time. And this is of course a biological burden uniquely borne by women. Moreover, maternity is not only a burden in terms of time. It is also risky, and often imposes on women a substantial <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">burden in terms of health</a>. Improved maternal health alleviates the adverse effects of pregnancy and childbirth on women's ability to work, and is hence a key driver of female labor force participation.</li>
 	<li>Estimates suggest that the historical decline in the burden of maternal conditions and the introduction of infant formula can account for approximately 50 percent of the increase in married women‚Äôs labor force participation between 1930 and 1960 in the US.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/index-of-us-maternal-mortality-and-female-labor-force-participation-flfp">Here</a> is a chart that shows long-run trends in maternal mortality and female labor supply in the US. You can read more about maternal mortality <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">here</a>, and you can read more about its link to female labor supply <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#maternal-health">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Fertility</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Lower rates of fertility can, in principle, free up a significant amount of women‚Äôs time, hence allowing them to enter the labor force more easily. And this is of course independent of health complications ‚Äì having children is very time consuming even when enjoying perfect health.</li>
 	<li>Indeed, there is strong evidence of a causal link between fertility (having children) and labor market outcomes (participation, employment, wages, etc.). In a recent study Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017)[ref]Lundborg, P., Plug, E., &amp; Rasmussen, A. W. (2017). Can Women Have Children and a Career? IV Evidence from IVF Treatments. American Economic Review, 107(6), 1611-1637. [/ref] show that women who are successfully treated by IVF (in vitro fertilization) in Denmark earn persistently less because of having children. They explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older.</li>
 	<li>There are many other studies that find similar effects on female labor supply when there are exogenous shocks to fertility. And interestingly, there is evidence that women‚Äôs control over their own fertility is linked to career investments and subsequent changes in labor market outcomes (see, for example, Goldin and Katz 2002).[ref]Goldin, C., &amp; Katz, L. F. 2002). The power of the pill: Oral contraceptives and women‚Äôs career and marriage decisions. <em>Journal of political Economy</em>, 110(4), 730-770. Available <a href="http://econ-2.econ.cam.ac.uk/events/seminars/Marshall_Lecture/marshlec/2002lecture2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.[/ref]</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fertility-and-female-labor-force-participation">Here</a> is a chart that shows the correlation between fertility and labor supply. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#fertility">Here</a> you can read more about the evidence supporting a causal link. And <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">here</a> you can read more about fertility in general.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Childcare and other family-oriented policies</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The fact that fertility reductions lead to higher labor force participation for women is certainly important from an empirical point of view. But it is obviously contradictory to promote female agency while suggesting women should have fewer children. So it is helpful to consider other factors that make employment compatible with childbearing, and thus broaden the choices available to women. Childcare and other family-oriented policies are prime examples here.</li>
 	<li>A cross-sectional analysis of data on public spending on family benefits shows that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-vs-public-spending-on-family-benefits-oecd">female employment tends to be higher in countries with higher levels of public spending on family benefits</a>.</li>

</ul>
<strong>Labor-saving consumer durables</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The consumer goods revolution, which introduced labor-saving durables such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and other time-saving products, is another factor that contributed to the rise in married female labor force participation in the last century.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours/#as-productivity-in-the-household-increased-working-hours-in-the-household-declined">Here</a> is a brief discussion of the correlation between hours worked in domestic activities and the availability of basic electrical appliances. And <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#labor-saving-consumer-durables">here</a> you can find more details about an academic study that estimates the associated effect on female labor supply.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Social norms and culture</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Social norms and culture circumscribe the extent to which it is possible or desirable for women to enter the labor force. It is therefore not hard to see why they play an important role.</li>
 	<li>Socially assigned gender roles have often been institutionally enforced. And this is still the case today: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/are-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-allowed-to-do-the-same-jobs-as-men">In most countries around the world there are restrictions on the types of work that women can do</a>.</li>
 	<li>From a historical point of view, there is evidence that social norms regarding economic gender roles have long been around, and they are very persistent (see, for example, Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn 2013).[ref]Alesina, A., Giuliano, P., &amp; Nunn, N. (2013). On the origins of gender roles: Women and the plough. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 128(2), 469-530.[/ref]</li>
 	<li>And yet, despite social norms being persistent, there is also evidence that large and sometimes sudden changes are possible. Research in this area shows that social norms and culture can be influenced in a number of non-institutional ways, including through intergenerational learning processes, exposure to alternative norms, and activism such as that which propelled the women's movement.[ref]Regarding intergenerational transmission of gender roles, see Fern√°ndez, R. (2013). Cultural change as learning: The evolution of female labor force participation over a century. The American Economic Review, 103(1), 472-500.
Regarding 'exposure to alternative norms', see for example the work of Jensen and Oster (2009), which considers the introduction of cable TV to an Indian village and the resulting significant changes in gender attitudes, available <a href="http://demo.ncaer.org/popuppages/EventDetails/E10Jan2009/neemrana-paper12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
For a discussion regarding social activism and its link to the other determinants mentioned above, see for example <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/351416?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> study by Heer and Grossbard-Shechtman (1981).[/ref]</li>
</ul>
<strong>Structural changes in the economy</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Social barriers affecting female labor supply operate differently in different contexts. In particular, income levels and macroeconomic variables play an important role. As we show above, there is a U-shaped relationship between GDP per capita and female labor force participation.
<ul>
 	<li>In low-income countries, where the agricultural sector is particularly important for the national economy, women are heavily involved in production, primarily as family workers. Under such circumstances, productive and reproductive work are not strictly delineated and the two can be more easily reconciled.</li>
 	<li>With technological change and market expansion, however, work becomes more capital intensive and is often physically separated from the home, thus contributing to a decrease in women‚Äôs labor force participation. Hence, in middle income countries, where there is often a social stigma attached to married women working in blue-collar industries, "women‚Äôs work is often implicitly bought by the family, and women retreat into the home, although their hours of work may not materially change."[ref]Goldin, C. (1994). The U-shaped female labor force function in economic development and economic history (No. w4707). <em>National Bureau of Economic Research</em>.[/ref]</li>
 	<li>With sustained development, women make educational gains and the value of their time in the market increases alongside the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">demand-side pull from growing service industries</a>. This means that in high income countries, the rise in female labor supply is characterized by women gaining the option of moving into paid, often white-collar work, while the opportunity cost of exiting the workforce for childcare rises.[ref]It is important to note, however, that even in rich countries such as the US (where female labor force participation rose dramatically in the second half of the 20th century and women's college attendance exceeds men's), women continue to be overrepresented in low-wage jobs. It is under such circumstances that female childcare workers are paradoxically unable to afford childcare for their own children. For more details see Entmacher, J., et al. (2014). Underpaid and overloaded: Women in low-wage jobs. Washington, DC: <em>National Women‚Äôs Law Center</em>.

This means they first went through a period of industrialization as the economic center of gravity shifted from agriculture to manufacturing, and then went through a period of deindustrialization, shifting the weight from manufacturing to services. In a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">companion blog post</a> we discuss this pattern in more detail.

How does this compare to the more recent experience of emerging economies? Are today‚Äôs developing countries following a similar process of structural transformation?

In this blog post we show that the patterns of structural transformation in developing countries are different to those of advanced, post-industrial economies. Specifically, we show that emerging economies have been deindustrializing more quickly. We explain how and why this is happening, and whether we should be worried about it.

In the first section we explore broad trends of industrialisation, and after pointing out the common patterns, we turn to an analysis of the particular aspects that make structural transformation in today's low income countries different, and perhaps problematic. 

<h4>Structural transformation, all around the world</h4>

<strong>Industry</strong>

One way to study the process of ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô across countries is to track how employment changes across sectors in the economy. The below chart does this, plotting the share of industry in total employment (vertical axis) against GDP per head (horizontal axis). This graph is a 'connected scatter plot' ‚Äì each line shows the trajectory that a country followed over time along these two dimensions. Data is available for a selection of more than 40 countries, across all continents.

There is a lot going on in this chart. But on the aggregate, it is easy to see a pattern: there is a hump-shaped relationship between industrialization (measured by employment shares) and incomes. In low and high income countries the share working in industrial sectors is low.

As we can see, at low levels of GDP per head, economic growth tends to go together with a rising share of employment in industry; then at an intermediate point in national incomes, the industrial sector reaches a peak; and after that point the relationship is inverted and further economic growth goes together with a lower share of employment in the industrial sector.

If you want to explore trends for a specific country, you can use the 'Search' option at the bottom of the chart. Or you can click on the continent names, on the right, to highlight regional patterns.

Of course, this broad inverted U-shape pattern is not shared by all countries. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-manufacturing-employment?country=COL">See for example Colombia</a>. And even among countries that do fit the pattern, we can see some interesting variations.

For example, the height of the 'humps' varies widely across countries. Indeed, the highest peaks in industry employment shares took place in the earliest industrializers: Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden and the UK all reached shares above 40% before beginning to deindustrialize (more on this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">here</a>). Outside Europe, the only countries to have reached comparable levels of industrialization are Mauritius and Taiwan.

You can use the slider at the bottom of this chart to change the time settings. If you move the left point of the slider all the way to 2010, the chart will show a snapshot of the cross-country correlation between average national incomes and the share of employment in industry. Doing this reveals that the cross-country correlation at any point in time is similar to the within-country correlation across time. This means that in the cross-section, the poorest and richest countries have some of the lowest shares of employment in industrial sectors while for individual countries over time, the lowest industry shares correspond to the periods with lowest and highest recorded income levels.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-manufacturing-employment" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Another way to explore the relative importance of manufacturing and other industrial sectors is to look at their importance in the country's total output. This is shown in the next chart, plotting the share of industry in total GDP (vertical axis), against GDP per capita (horizontal axis).

Although the same broad hump-shaped pattern holds, there are two important points here that deserve more discussion.

The first point to note is that in the chart below, countries such as Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria and Venezuela have an extremely large share of industry in GDP vis-a-vis their industry employment shares. This difference can be attributed to the fact that these countries are major natural resource exporters. The mining or oil extraction industries that¬†show up in the data as part of 'industry' are usually very capital intensive and generate a lot of revenue relative to the quantity of labor employed.[ref]Our sectoral classification follows from Berthold Herrendorf, Richard Rogerson and Akos Valentinyi (2014) ‚Äì ‚ÄúGrowth and Structural Transformation‚Äù Handbook of Economic Growth Vol. 2B.

You can find more details in the 'Sources' tab on our charts.[/ref]

The second point to note is that the observed patterns depend on the actual measure used to capture the relative importance of each sector. Put simply: the hump-shaped pattern is different if we look at employment or GDP shares. Consider South Korea. If we look at employment shares in the chart above, we find that the relative importance of industry in South Korea peaked in 1992. However, if we look at output shares, we find that the relative importance of this sector has not yet peaked. 

This point is perhaps not surprising. GDP measures outputs, while employment measures inputs; so it is natural to expect that these two measures of industrialisation provide slightly different perspectives.[ref]In fact, fully understanding structural transformation in specific countries and periods requires understanding changes in the extent to which intermediate goods are traded across economic sectors.  <a href="http://voxeu.org/article/outsourcing-and-shift-manufacturing-services">Berlingieri (2014)</a>, for example, estimates that the structural transformation from manufacturing to services in the US is partly the result of shifts in organisational boundaries, in which work that was previously done within manufacturing firms is now outsourced to specialized service providers.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-manufacturing-GDP" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

In the chart above we plot current-price measures of value added. This means that the figures correspond to estimates of the value of output calculated at the prices prevailing when the output was produced. Does this matter? It does. Measured this way, the changes in production values between any two years consist of a combination of movements in prices and movements in volumes. Hence, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-industry-GDP-at-constant-prices">the picture would look different</a> if we had chosen to show value added figures in constant prices (i.e. estimating the value of output at the prevailing prices of one fixed point in time). In the technical note at the end of this post we discuss this in more detail. The key point to note is that in constant prices, the pattern of ‚Äòdeindustrialization‚Äô in rich countries is less marked. 

This reinforces what we already mentioned: alternative ways of measuring the weight of manufacturing and related sectors in the economy offer different perspectives of industrialization patterns. With this in mind, let's now turn to exploring industrialization from the perspective of the the other,¬†notably interrelated, sectors.

<strong>Agriculture and Services</strong>

If the weight of the industrial sector in the economy changes, this obviously has a mirror effect on other sectors, namely agriculture and services. The next two charts show the share of employment in agriculture and services against GDP per capita. As we can see, in all the countries with available data, economic growth has meant a shift of workers away from agriculture (first chart below) and into services (second chart below).

Similar patterns can be observed if we plot <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-agriculture-GDP">the share of output from agriculture</a> and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-services-GDP">share of output from services</a> against GDP per capita.

Taken together, the evidence shows that 'structural transformation' is a generalized phenomenon. Countries tend to go first through a period of industrialization, where economic activity shifts from agriculture to industry; and then they go through a period of deindustrialization, where there is a shift from industry to services.

This is of course not necessarily a story of a stagnant agricultural sector being overtaken by dynamic manufacturing and service sectors. Instead, this is a story of changes in relative productivity, with one sector overtaking the other. (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">Here</a> you can read more about relative vs absolute changes in productivity in the context of structural transformation).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-services-employment" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>Structural transformation, different today</h4>

<strong>The idea of 'premature deindustrialization' </strong>

Despite the commonly-observed broad patterns discussed so far, it is easy to see that not all countries go through the different stages of structural transformation at the same level of economic development. Compare South Africa and Italy in the chart above. In 2007 South Africa had a GDP per capita similar to that of Italy in 1960. Yet at this level of economic development, South Africa had a much larger share of employment in the service sector (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-services-employment-eg">almost twice as large</a>). 

This observation goes further. Many emerging economies, notably those in Africa, have been going through a process of 'premature deindustrialization', in the sense that they have experienced a much quicker transition into the services sector relative to the changes experienced by early-industrialized countries when they were at comparable levels of economic development.  

Of course, 'premature deindustrialization' is not happening everywhere, and to a great extent the broad cross-country pattern we observe is the result of global manufacturing becoming increasingly concentrated in countries such as China.[ref]Since China is a particularly populous country, it is not surprising that at the global level, the manufacturing sector‚Äôs value added and employment contribution to world GDP and employment, respectively, have not changed significantly since 1970. You can read more about this in  Haraguchi, N., Cheng, C. F. C., & Smeets, E. (2017). The importance of manufacturing in economic development: Has this changed?. World Development, 93, 293-315. Available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Fang_Chin_Cheng/publication/313831840_The_Importance_of_Manufacturing_in_Economic_Development_Has_This_Changed/links/58ac903faca272af06662630/The-Importance-of-Manufacturing-in-Economic-Development-Has-This-Changed.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. [/ref] But the fact remains: industry seems to have played a greater role in the growth experiences of today's rich countries than in most of today's poorer countries.

Let us look at why this is happening, and whether it is a good or bad thing.

<strong> What causes premature deindustrialization?</strong>

In a much cited paper, Dani Rodrik argues that premature deindustrialization can be attributed to the combination of two factors: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technological-progress/">technological progress</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade">international trade</a>.[ref]The term 'premature deindustrialization' has been coined in a number of academic papers. Our analysis follows the exposition in Rodrik, D. (2016). Premature deindustrialization. Journal of Economic Growth, 21(1), 1-33. Available online <a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/premature_deindustrialization.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

Technological progress in recent decades has contributed to reducing the competitiveness of low income countries with a smaller proportion of skilled workers. In the past, many countries entered the manufacturing sector by first engaging in simpler, labor-intensive activities and then gradually moving up the industrial ladder. In recent decades this strategy has become less attainable because of increased skill requirements in the industrial sector. Today, it is no longer the case that farmers can easily transition to working in factories with little investment in additional training.

Globalization, in turn, has interacted with labor-saving technological progress, amplifying the mechanism described above. Comparative advantage forces exacerbate the difficulties faced by low income countries trying to enter a highly competitive global manufacturing sector.

In a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/poor-economies-growing-without-industrializing-by-dani-rodrik-2017-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent overview of the literature</a>, Rodrik writes: "<em>It is now well documented that manufacturing has become increasingly skill-intensive in recent decades. Along with globalization, this has made it very difficult for newcomers to break into world markets for manufacturing in a big way and replicate the experience of Asia‚Äôs manufacturing superstars. Except for a handful of exporters, developing economies have been experiencing premature deindustrialization. It seems as if the escalator has been taken away from the lagging countries.</em>"

It is likely that these constraints will remain binding for years to come: unless skills and training expand drastically, automation and further technological change will make it increasingly difficult for today's poor countries to follow the path that early-industrialized countries took.

<strong>Why should we care?</strong>

Failing to develop a sizable secondary sector might have important implications. First, there are redistributive consequences: simple manufacturing industries tend to be quite labor-intensive, so they provide jobs for workers coming from the countryside with relative ease.[ref]Related to this, it has been argued that even at comparable income levels, welfare is lower in the ‚Äòconsumption cities‚Äô created by service-led growth than in the ‚Äòproduction cities‚Äô created by industrialization. For more on this see Gollin, D., Jedwab, R., &amp; Vollrath, D. (2016). Urbanization with and without Industrialization. Journal of Economic Growth, 21(1), 35-70. Available online <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f265e50a-fb29-4bd0-8599-93814e55ae6f/datastreams/ATTACHMENT01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. [/ref] And second, there might be efficiency consequences: missing out on the ‚Äòmanufacturing bandwagon‚Äô lowers growth prospects because manufacturing industries tend to be particularly conducive to productivity growth. This efficiency argument comes from the fact that in the manufacturing sector, more than in other sectors, it is usually easier to absorb technology from abroad and generate high-productivity jobs.[ref]More formally, the key point is that manufacturing industries, in contrast to other sectors of the economy,  exhibit cross-country productivity convergence. This means that productivity in the formal manufacturing sector in poorer countries, where there is a higher marginal productivity of capital, tends to grow more rapidly than in rich countries.  See  Rodrik, D. (2012). Unconditional convergence in manufacturing. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 128(1), 165-204.[/ref]

In addition to these factors, there might be other consequences to keep in mind, such as those related to the development of institutions. For example, Rodrik argues that industrialization was crucial for the development of the labor movement, which led to demands for the expansion of voting rights and eventually the creation of the welfare state. Indeed, the political economy literature suggests that bargaining between elites and organized labor played a crucial role in the development of democracy.[ref]See, for example, Acemoglu, D., & Robinson, J. A. (2005). Economic origins of dictatorship and democracy. Cambridge University Press.[/ref] Hence, since premature deindustrialization can lead to weaker organized labor in today‚Äôs low income countries, it may take them down a path of political development that is less conducive to liberal democracy.

<em>Technical note: </em>

The charts showing changes in the composition of GDP by sector use current prices (i.e. figures correspond to estimates of value added at the prevailing prices when output took place). Measured this way, the changes in production values between any two years will consist of a combination of movements in prices and movements in volumes. Thus, we cannot know if the change in sectoral composition between any two years is a consequence of price changes or of more ‚Äòfundamental‚Äô structural changes of produced volumes.

An alternative way of measuring sectoral value added is by ‚Äòchaining‚Äô prices to those observed in a particular year, which allows us to control for changes in prices. By dividing sectoral value added by the ratio of current prices to prices in the chained year, it is possible to work out the volume of production.

Although this is a more reliable measure of the growth in productive capacity, it is difficult to use in cross-country comparisons of sectoral composition, due to the tendency of a sector to experience a decline in the price of its output as its productivity rises. Given the tendency for manufacturing to experience higher productivity growth than other sectors of the economy, and consequently for its relative price to fall over time, the implication is that the earlier the year to which we chain prices, the larger the manufacturing sector will appear to be. In fact, Rodrik (2016)[ref]Rodrik, D. (2016). ‚ÄúPremature Deindustrialization‚Äù. Journal of Economic Growth, 21(1), 1-33.[/ref] finds that in large part, the continued reduction in the current price share of manufacturing in rich countries‚Äô GDP masks the fact that when measured in real terms (ie. keeping prices constant), the trend is less pronounced. The chart in the thumbnail below shows this (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-industry-GDP-at-constant-prices">here is the interactive version</a>).

<ul>
 	<li>Child maltreatment is common and takes many forms. From <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/#violent-discipline">physical or emotional abuse</a>, to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/">child labor</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/#child-marriage-and-female-genital-mutilation">other practices that violate their most basic rights</a>.</li>
 	<li>Violence against children, at home, schools, or in the broader society, affects educational outcomes. It affects whether children are able to attend and remain in school, as well as whether they make progress in terms of learning outcomes. And at the same time, educational outcomes affect violence ‚Äì education has been identified as a tool to reduce violence against children.</li>
 	<li>In this post we focus on the importance of child maltreatment specifically in the context of children's education and give an overview of the empirical evidence.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Child Labor</strong>

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/#definitions-and-measurement">Child labor constitutes in most situations a violation of children's rights,</a> as it is often linked to several forms of abuse and harm. Specifically in the context of education, child labor is often linked to poor educational outcomes. The following visualization, from Schultz and Strauss (2008),[ref] Eric V. Edmonds "Child Labor", Chapter 57 in T. Paul Schultz, John Strauss (2008), Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 4. North Holland[/ref] shows evidence for this. It plots school attendance rates for children aged 10‚Äì14 years olds, against total hours worked in the last week (by type of work) with 95 percent confidence intervals (labeled CI and plotted in lighter shades).

Children who work more hours tend to attend school less frequently. And the steepest segments of the pictured curves are in the range 20-45 hours, which suggests ‚Äî as one would naturally expect ‚Äî that it is most difficult for a child to attend school when approaching¬†full-time work. 

This evidence also shows that there is no significant difference between children engaged in domestic or marketed work.

<h6>School Attendance vs. Hours Worked - Schultz and Strauss (2008) [ref] Eric V. Edmonds "Child Labor", Chapter 57 in T. Paul Schultz, John Strauss (2008), Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 4. North Holland[/ref]

Edmonds &quot;Child Labor&quot;, Chapter 57 in T. Paul Schultz, John Strauss (2008), Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 4. North Holland." width="400" height="281" /></a></h6>

The chart above shows the relationship between school attendance and hours worked using <em>micro</em> data, which means that the authors investigate the relationship across <em>individual</em> households. A similar pattern can also be seen in the data if we look at the corresponding country-level macro variables: In countries where children tend to work longer hours, it is more common that working children remain out of school. The interactive chart below shows this by plotting country-level average hours worked by children against share of working children who are out of school.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/working-children-out-of-school-ages-7-14-vs-hours-worked-by-children-ages-7-14" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

These correlations on the micro and macro level are of course not enough to establish a causal relationship. There are many potential economic and cultural factors that simultaneously influence both schooling and work decisions; and in any case, the direction of the relationships is not obvious‚Äîdo children work because they are not attending school, or do they fail to attend school because they are working?

A number of academic studies have tried to investigate whether there is indeed a¬†causal relationship by attempting to find a factor (an ‚Äò<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation">instrumental variable</a>‚Äô) that only affects whether a child works without affecting how the family values other uses of the child‚Äôs time.¬†These studies ‚Äì like Rosati &amp; Rossi 2003 or Gunnarsson, Orazem &amp; Sanchez 2006)[ref] Rosati, F., Rossi, M. (2003). <a href="ftp://www.ceistorvergata.it/repec/rpaper/No-25-Rosati,Rossi.pdf">Children‚Äôs working hours and school enrollment: Evidence from Pakistan and Nicaragua</a>. World Bank Economic Review 17, 283‚Äì295. Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006)[ref]Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006). <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/orazem/Child%20Labor%20in%20Latin%20America.pdf">Child labor and school achievement in Latin America</a>. World Bank Economic Review 20, 31‚Äì54.[/ref] ‚Äì suggest that there is indeed a causal relationship: work often does determine whether a child remains in, or drops out of, school.

<strong>Physical and psychological abuse</strong>

Children who are victims of physical or psychological abuse tend to have worse educational outcomes; and while evidence supporting a causal link is scarce, it is important to pay attention to these correlations.

A recent study used detailed household surveys from South Africa and Malawi to document the prevalence of violent discipline and subsequent changes in school progress among the affected children. The study found that children who were exposed to psychological and physical violence for discipline were more likely to have dropped out of school upon follow-up (Sherr et al. 2015).[ref]Sherr, L., Hensels, I. S., Skeen, S., Tomlinson, M., Roberts, K. J., &amp; Macedo, A. (2015). Exposure to violence predicts poor educational outcomes in young children in South Africa and Malawi. International health, 8(1), 36-43.[/ref]

Other studies have found that violence against children also correlates with poor educational outcomes in the long run. In rich countries, for example, studies have found that individuals who are exposed to sexual and physical abuse in childhood are more likely to drop out of college (Boden et al. 2007 and Duncan 2000).[ref]Boden, J. M., Horwood, L. J., &amp; Fergusson, D. M. (2007). Exposure to childhood sexual and physical abuse and subsequent educational achievement outcomes. Child abuse &amp; neglect, 31(10), 1101-1114. Duncan, R. D. (2000). Childhood maltreatment and college drop-out rates: Implications for child abuse researchers. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 15(9), 987-995.[/ref]

These correlations also extend to other forms of violence and other types of educational outcomes. Within schools, for instance, violence between children tends to go together with poor learning outcomes. The following chart provides an example of this correlation. It shows, for a number of countries, the percentage of grade 8 students scoring above the low international benchmark in the TIMSS mathematics test, by their involvement in physical fights in school. Numeracy results were consistently higher among children not involved in physical fights in school.
<h6>School fighting vs Minimum proficiency in maths ‚Äì UNESCO (2016) [ref]Figure 4.3 in UNESCO (2016), Education for People and Planet, Global Education Monitoring Report. Available online <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002457/245752e.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13851" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS-750x301.png" alt="" width="750" height="301" /></a>

Physical and psychological abuse are often linked to negative effects on mental and physical health. For example, it has been documented that anxiety and depression tend to arise more frequently among children who are abused.[ref]Norman, R. E., Byambaa, M., De, R., Butchart, A., Scott, J., &amp; Vos, T. (2012). The long-term health consequences of child physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect: a systematic review and meta-analysis. PLoS medicine, 9(11), e1001349. Available <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] Again, these correlations do not imply causation. But there are good reasons to take them seriously. The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Development Report (2018)</a> notes that toxic stress in the early years can undermine lifelong health, learning, and behavior, because the hormones associated with the fight-or-flight response, such as cortisol, can inhibit physical growth and the children‚Äôs susceptibility to illness. It is also the case that these hormones can impair the development of neural connections in parts of the brain that are critical for learning.

The following is an example of the type of brain development problems that scientists attribute to sensory neglect in early childhood. The source is Perry (2002).[ref]Perry, B. D. (2002). Childhood experience and the expression of genetic potential: What childhood neglect tells us about nature and nurture. Brain and mind, 3(1), 79-100.[/ref] The CT scan on the left is an image from a healthy three year old with a typical head size (at the 50th percentile of the distribution). The image on the right is from a three year old child suffering from 'severe sensory-deprivation neglect' ‚Äì minimal exposure to language, touch, and social interactions. The brain of the child on the right is significantly smaller than average (3rd percentile) and has signs of deterioration (cortical atrophy).

Of course, this comparison is just an illustration, and it is hard to know with certainty whether the observed differences in brain size can be fully attributed to sensory-deprivation neglect. However, Perry finds that the average head size among a group of 40 children who had suffered sensory neglect is below the 5th percentile in the distribution ‚Äì and while some recovery in brain-size was observed after children were removed from the neglectful environment, in most cases the gaps remained significant.

These findings are relevant to education because brain malleability is much greater earlier in life, and brain development is sequential and cumulative; which means that brain deterioration can lead to permanent impairments on skill acquisition.[ref]Perry (2002) writes: <em>"In following these globally-neglected children over time we observed some recovery of function and relative brain-size when these children were removed from the neglectful environment and placed in foster care. The degree of recovery over a year period however was inversely proportional to age in which the child was removed from the neglecting caregivers. The earlier in life and the less time in the sensory-depriving environment, the more robust the recovery."</em>[/ref]

<strong>Feedback loops</strong>

The interaction between violence and education operates in both directions, which means education can be used as an instrument to reduce the prevalence of violence. In Uganda, for example, a programme that provided life skills and vocational training for girls who had been forced into sexual acts, led to substantially fewer of these girls being victims of sexual abuse ‚Äì an impact largely attributed to acquired skills (Bandiera et al. 2017).[ref]The evidence in this study comes from a Randomized Control Trial.

Similarly, parenting interventions that promote skills and knowledge among parents have shown positive effects on domestic violence. In Liberia, for example, a program that provided training in positive parenting and non-violent behaviour reduced violent punishment drastically (Sim et al. 2014).[ref]The evidence in this study comes from comparisons in reported punishment attitudes before and after the intervention, relative to the changes observed in a control group (i.e. the evidence comes from a Randomized Control Trial with a control group).

<strong>Wrapping up</strong>

Evidence from a range of countries shows that there is a correlation between violence against children and educational outcomes. These correlations are strong and hold for different forms of victimization. In some cases there is evidence of causal relationships; but even in contexts where causality is not clear, these correlations are important because they show that different forms of hardship often converge on some of the most vulnerable members of society.";s:10:"post_title";s:43:"Child maltreatment and educational outcomes";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:48:"violence-childrens-rights-and-education-outcomes";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-12-18 20:28:06";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-12-18 20:28:06";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:35:"https://ourworldindata.org/?p=13847";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"15300";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-19 10:00:12";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-19 10:00:12";s:12:"post_content";s:13860:"<div class="blog-info">

The 'gender pay gap' comes up often in <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-clinton-foundation-pays-top-wome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political debates</a>, <a href="https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/Complete-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy reports</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/26/football-gender-pay-gap-worse-than-in-politics-medicine-and-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everyday news</a>. But what is it? What does it tell us? Is it different from country to country? How does it change over time?

In this blog post I try to answer these questions, providing an empirical overview of the gender pay gap across countries and over time. I've structured the analysis around six 'key facts'.

<strong> 1) The gender pay gap measures inequality but not necessarily discrimination</strong>

The gender pay gap (or the gender wage gap) is a metric that tells us the difference in pay (or wages, or income) between women and men. It's a measure of inequality and captures a concept that is broader than the concept of equal pay for equal work.

Differences in pay between men and women capture differences along many possible dimensions, including worker education, experience and occupation. When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male workers to all female workers ‚Äì irrespective of differences along these additional dimensions ‚Äì the result is the 'raw' or 'unadjusted' pay gap. On the contrary, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, etc., then the result is the 'adjusted' pay gap. The key facts below cover <em>unadjusted</em> measures of the gender pay gap. (You can read about the adjusted pay gap in our companion blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">here</a>.)

Discrimination in hiring practices can exist in the absence of pay gaps ‚Äì for example, if women know they will be treated unfairly and hence choose not to participate in the labor market. Similarly, it is possible to observe large pay gaps in the absences of discrimination in hiring practices ‚Äì for example, if women get fair treatment but apply for lower-paid jobs.

The implication is that observing differences in pay between men and women is neither necessary nor sufficient to prove discrimination in the workplace. Both discrimination and inequality are important. But they are not one and the same. (You can read about discrimination and 'equal pay for equal work' in our companion blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">here</a>).

<strong> 2) In most countries there is a substantial gender pay gap</strong>

Cross-country data on the gender pay gap is patchy, but the most complete source in terms of coverage is the United Nation's <em>International Labour Organization</em> (ILO). The following visualization presents this data. You can add observations by clicking on the option 'add country' at the bottom of the chart.

The estimates shown below correspond to differences between average hourly earnings of men and women (expressed as a percentage of average hourly earnings of men), and cover all workers irrespective of whether they work full time or part time.[ref]There are some exceptions to this definition. In particular, sometimes self-employed workers, or part-time workers are excluded. You can explore these exceptions using the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pagehierarchy/Page30.jspx?_afrLoop=50047868615925&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D50047868615925%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D177i1q1z1w_130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation files containing all the relevant indicator notes.</a>[/ref]

As we can see: (i) in most countries the gap is positive ‚Äì women earn less than men; and (ii) there are large differences in the size of this gap across countries. Below we come back to these cross-country differences.

(NB. By this measure the gender wage gap can be positive or negative. If it is negative, it means that, on an hourly basis, men earn on average less than women. This happens in some countries, such as Malaysia.)

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo?country=CHE+URY+HTI+FRA+CRI+VNM+KOR+PAK+NOR+BRA+DNK+POL+RUS+COL+BEL+ESP" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>3) In most countries the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades</strong>

How is the gender pay gap changing over time? To answer this question, let's consider the following chart, showing available estimates from the OECD. These estimates include OECD member states, as well as some other non-member countries, and they are the longest available series of cross-country data on the gender pay gap that we are aware of.

Here we see that the gap is large in most OECD countries, but it has been going down in the last couple of decades. In some cases the reduction is remarkable. In the UK, for example, the gap went down from almost 50% in 1970 to about 17% in 2016.

These estimates are not directly comparable to those from the ILO, because the pay gap is measured slightly differently here: The OECD estimates refer to percent differences in <em>median</em> earnings (i.e. the gap here captures differences between men and women in the middle of the earnings distribution); and they cover only full-time employees and self-employed workers (i.e. the gap here excludes disparities that arise from differences in hourly wages for part-time and full-time workers).

However, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-2000-vs-2015"> ILO data shows similar trends for the period 2000-2015.</a>

The conclusion is that in most countries with available data, the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>4) The gender pay gap is larger for older workers</strong>

The <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Census Bureau</a> defines the pay gap as the ratio between median wages ‚Äì that is, they measure the gap by calculating the wages of men and women at the middle of the earnings distribution, and dividing them.

By this measure, the gender wage gap is expressed as a percent (median earnings of women as share of median earnings of men) and it is always positive. Here, values below 100% mean that women earn less than men, while values above 100% mean than women earn more. Values closer to 100% reflect a lower gap.

The next chart shows available estimates of this metric for full-time workers in the US, by age group.

First, we see that the series trends upwards, meaning the gap has been <em>shrinking</em> in the last couple of decades. Secondly, we see that there are important differences by age.

The second point is crucial to understand the gender pay gap: the gap is a statistic that changes during the life of a worker. In most rich countries, it‚Äôs small when formal education ends and employment begins, and it increases with age. As we discuss in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">analysis of the determinants</a>, the gender pay gap tends to increase when women marry and when/if they have children.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/womens-weekly-earnings-as-a-percentage-of-mens-by-age-bureau-of-labor-statistics-2017" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong> 5) Women in rich countries tend to be overrepresented in the bottom of the income distribution ‚Äì and underrepresented at the top</strong>

Another way to look at cross-country gender inequalities in earnings is to focus on the share of women among low-pay earners. This is shown in the chart below. Here, 'low-pay' refers to workers earning less than two-thirds of the median (i.e. the middle) of the earnings distribution.

A share above 50% implies that women are 'overrepresented', in the sense that among those with low wages, there are more women than men.

The fact that women in rich countries are overrepresented in the bottom of the income distribution goes together with the fact that working women in these countries are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/us-women-are-overrepresented-in-low-wage-occupations">overrepresented in low-paying occupations</a>. This is also crucial to understand the pay gap: <a href="https://owid.cloud/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">occupational choice is a key contributor to the observed inequalities</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/female-share-of-low-pay-earners" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

A similar analysis at the opposite tail of the distribution is also insightful. The following chart shows, for the UK, the share of women at different brackets of the income distribution across time.

Here we can see that among those with high incomes, women are a minority in the UK. However, the representation of women at the top of the income distribution has been increasing over time.

Notice also¬†that the rate of increase in the proportion of high-income women in the UK is smaller within the very top income groups. This is usually interpreted as sign of the 'glass ceiling' in female earnings, and is actually a pattern that is observed in other countries too. In the US, for example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-gender-wage-ratio-in-different-income-percentiles">the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom</a>.

<strong>6) The gender pay gap is smaller in middle-income countries ‚Äì which tend to be countries with low labor force participation of women</strong>

The following scatter plot shows available ILO estimates on the gender pay gap (vertical axis) vs GDP per capita (on a logarithmic scale along the horizontal axis). As we can see there is a weak positive correlation between GDP per capita and the gender pay gap. However, the chart shows that the relationship is not really linear. Actually, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-banks-income-groups?year=2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">middle-income countries</a> tend to have the smallest pay gap.

The fact that middle-income countries have low gender wage gaps is, to a large extent, the result of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-rates-by-national-per-capita-income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selection of women into employment</a>. Olivetti and Petrongolo (2008)[ref]Olivetti, C., &amp; Petrongolo, B. (2008). Unequal pay or unequal employment? A cross-country analysis of gender gaps. Journal of Labor Economics, 26(4), 621-654.[/ref] explain it as follows: ‚Äúif women who are employed tend to have relatively high‚Äêwage characteristics, low female employment rates may become consistent with low gender wage gaps simply because low‚Äêwage women would not feature in the observed wage distribution.‚Äù

Olivetti and Petrongolo (2008) show that this pattern holds in the data: unadjusted gender wage gaps across countries tend to be negatively correlated with gender employment gaps. That is, <a href="https://owid.cloud/grapher/gender-gap-in-hourly-wages-vs-ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation">the gender pay gaps tend to be smaller where relatively fewer women participate in the labor force</a>.

So, rather than reflect greater equality, the lower wage gaps observed in some countries could indicate that only women with certain characteristics ‚Äì for instance, with no husband or children ‚Äì are entering the workforce.

In almost all countries, if you compare the wages of men and women you find that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo">women tend to earn less than men.</a>¬†These inequalities have been narrowing across the world. In particular, over the last couple of decades <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA">most high-income countries have seen sizeable reductions in the gender pay gap</a>.

I provide a thorough description of these facts in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/six-facts-pay-gap">companion blog post</a>. Here I want to focus on the determinants of the gender pay gap: How did these reductions come about and why do substantial gaps remain?

Before we get into the details, here is a preview of the main points.
<ul>
 	<li>An important part of the reduction in the gender pay gap in rich countries over the last decades is due to a historical narrowing, and often even reversal of the <em>education</em> gap between men and women.</li>
 	<li>Today, education is relatively unimportant to explain the remaining gender pay gap in rich countries. In contrast, the <em>characteristics of the jobs</em> that women tend to do, remain important contributing factors.</li>
 	<li>The gender pay gap is not a direct metric of discrimination. However, evidence from different contexts suggests <em>discrimination</em> is indeed important to understand the gender pay gap. Similarly, <em>social norms</em> affecting the gender distribution of labor are important determinants of wage inequality.</li>
 	<li>On the other hand, the available evidence suggests differences in psychological attributes and non-cognitive skills are at best modest factors contributing to the gender pay gap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences in human capital</h3>
<strong> The adjusted pay gap</strong>

Differences in earnings between men and women capture differences across many possible dimensions, including education, experience and occupation.

For example, if we consider that more educated people tend to have higher earnings, it is natural to expect that the narrowing of the pay gap across the world can be partly explained by the fact that women have been catching up with men in terms of educational attainment, in particular years of schooling.

The following chart plots female-to-male ratios of average years of schooling by world regions. It shows the historical narrowing, and sometimes even reversal of the education gap between men and women. (You can read more about this in our entry on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education">Global Rise of Education</a>.)

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-ratios-for-mean-years-of-schooling" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Since differences in education partly contribute to explain differences in wages, it is common to distinguish between 'unadjusted' and 'adjusted' pay differences.

When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male and female workers, irrespective of differences in worker characteristics, the result is the raw or <em>unadjusted</em> pay gap. In contrast to this, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, and other factors that matter for the pay gap, then the result is the <em>adjusted</em> pay gap.

The idea of the adjusted pay gap is to make comparisons within groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education. This allows us to tease out the extent to which different factors contribute to observed inequalities.

The following chart, from Blau and Kahn (2017)[ref]Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available online <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. [/ref] shows the evolution of the adjusted and unadjusted gender pay gap in the US.

More precisely, the chart shows the evolution of female to male wage ratios in three different scenarios: (i) Unadjusted; (ii) Adjusted, controlling for gender differences in human capital, i.e. education and experience; and (iii) Adjusted, controlling for a full range of covariates, including education, experience, job industry and occupation, among others. The difference between 100% and the full specification (the green bars) is the ‚Äúunexplained‚Äù residual.[ref]For each specification, Blau and Kahn (2017) perform regression analyses on data from the PSID (the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics), which includes information on labor-market experience and considers men and women ages 25-64 who were full-time, non-farm, wage and salary workers. [/ref]

Several points stand out here.
<ul>
 	<li>First, the unadjusted¬†gender pay gap in the US shrunk over this period.¬†This is evident from the fact that the blue bars are closer to 100% in 2010 than in 1980.</li>
 	<li>Second, if we focus on groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education, we also see a narrowing.¬†The adjusted gender pay gap has shrunk.</li>
 	<li>Third, we can see that education and experience used to help explain a very large part of the pay gap in 1980, but this changed substantially in the decades that followed. This third point follows from the fact that the difference between the blue and red bars was much larger in 1980 than in 2010.</li>
 	<li>And fourth, the green bars grew substantially in the 1980s, but stayed fairly constant thereafter. In other words: Most of the convergence in earnings occurred during the 1980s, a decade in which the "unexplained" gap shrunk substantially.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16606" src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-739x550.png" alt="" width="739" height="550" /></a>

Blau and Kahn further break down the wage gap into contributing factors. The following chart shows the relative importance of specific labor market characteristics in 1980 and 2010.

Now we see that in the US, education and experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages over time, while occupation and industry have become more important.[ref]In 2010, unionization and education show negative values; this reflects the fact that women have surpassed men in educational attainment, and unionization in the US has been in general decline with a greater effect on men.[/ref]

<strong>How to interpret the 'unexplained residual'?</strong>

The chart above shows that the 'unexplained' residual went down over the period 1980-2010. This means the observable characteristics of workers and their jobs explain wage differences better today than a couple of decades ago. At first sight, this seems like good news ‚Äì it suggests that today there is less discrimination, in the sense that differences in earnings are today much more readily explained by differences in 'productivity' factors. But is this really the case?

The unexplained residual may include aspects of unmeasured productivity (i.e. unobservable worker characteristics that cannot be controlled for in a regression), while the "explained" factors may themselves be vehicles of discrimination.

For example, suppose that women are indeed discriminated against, and they find it hard to get hired for certain jobs simply because of their sex. This would mean that in the adjusted specification, we would see that occupation and industry are important contributing factors ‚Äì but that is precisely because discrimination is embedded in occupational differences!

Hence, while the unexplained residual gives us a first-order approximation of what is going on, we need much more detailed data and analysis in order to say something definitive about the role of discrimination in observed pay differences. I will discuss the evidence on discrimination further below.
<h3>Looking beyond worker characteristics</h3>
<strong>Job flexibility</strong>

All over the world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-to-male-ratio-of-time-devoted-to-unpaid-care-work">women tend to do more unpaid care work at home than men</a> ‚Äì and women tend to be overrepresented in low paying jobs where they have the flexibility required to attend to these additional responsibilities.

The most important evidence regarding this link between the gender pay gap and job flexibility is presented and discussed by Claudia Goldin in the article '<a href="http://econweb.umd.edu/~davis/eventpapers/GoldinConvergence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter</a>', where she digs deep in the data from the US.[ref]Goldin, C. (2014). A grand gender convergence: Its last chapter. The American Economic Review, 104(4), 1091-1119.[/ref] There are some key lessons that apply both to rich and non-rich countries.

Goldin shows that when one looks at the data on occupational choice in some detail, it becomes clear that women disproportionately seek jobs, including full-time jobs, that tend to be compatible with childrearing and other family responsibilities. In other words, women, more than men, are expected to have temporal flexibility in their jobs. Things like shifting hours of work and rearranging shifts to accommodate emergencies at home. And these are jobs with lower earnings per hour, even when the total number of hours worked is the same.

The importance of job flexibility in this context is very clearly illustrated by the fact that, over the last couple of decades, women in the US increased their participation and remuneration in only some fields. In a recent paper, Goldin and Katz (2016)[ref]Goldin, C., &amp; Katz, L. F. (2016). A most egalitarian profession: pharmacy and the evolution of a family-friendly occupation. Journal of Labor Economics, 34(3), 705-746. Available online <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/jole_gk_pharm_published.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] show that pharmacy became a highly remunerated female-majority profession with a small gender earnings gap in the US, at the same time as pharmacies went through substantial technological changes that made flexible jobs in the field more productive (e.g. computer systems that increased the substitutability among pharmacists.)

The chart below shows how quickly female wages increased in pharmacy, relative to other professions, over the last few decades in the US.

<strong>The motherhood penalty</strong>

Closely related to job flexibility and occupational choice, is the issue of work interruptions due to motherhood. On this front there is again a great deal of evidence in support of the so-called 'motherhood penalty'.

Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017)[ref]Lundborg, P., Plug, E., &amp; Rasmussen, A. W. (2017). Can Women Have Children and a Career? IV Evidence from IVF Treatments. American Economic Review, 107(6), 1611-1637.[/ref] provide evidence from Denmark ‚Äì more specifically, Danish women who sought medical help in achieving pregnancy.

By tracking women‚Äôs fertility and employment status through detailed periodic surveys, these researchers were able to establish that women who had a successful <em>in vitro fertilization</em> treatment, ended up having lower earnings down the line than similar women who, by chance, were unsuccessfully treated.

Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen summarise their findings as follows: "Our main finding is that women who are successfully treated by [in vitro fertilization] earn persistently less because of having children. We explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older. We explain the decline in hourly earnings, which is often referred to as the motherhood penalty, by women moving to lower-paid jobs that are closer to home."

The fact that the motherhood penalty is indeed about ‚Äòmotherhood‚Äô and not ‚Äòparenthood‚Äô, is supported by further evidence. 

<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24219#fromrss">A recent study</a>, also from Denmark, tracked men and women over the period 1980-2013, and found that after the first child, women‚Äôs earnings sharply dropped and never fully recovered. But this was not the case for men with children, nor the case for women without children.

These patterns are shown in the chart below.  The first panel shows the trend in earnings for Danish women with and without children. The second panel shows the same comparison for Danish men.

<a href="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Impacts-of-Children-on-earnings-Denmark.png"><img src="https://owid.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Impacts-of-Children-on-earnings-Denmark-750x378.png" alt="" width="750" height="378" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16829" /></a>

Note that these two examples are from Denmark ‚Äì a country that <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/data">ranks high on gender equality measures </a> and where <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/are-mothers-guaranteed-an-equivalent-position-after-maternity-leave">there are legal guarantees requiring that a woman can return to the same job after taking time to give birth.</a>

This shows that, although <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257%2Fjep.12.1.137">family-friendly policies contribute to improve female labor force participation and reduce the gender pay gap</a>, they are only part of the solution. Even when there is generous paid leave and subsidized childcare, as long as mothers disproportionately take additional work at home after having children, inequities in pay are likely to remain.

<strong>Ability, personality and social norms</strong>

The discussion so far has emphasised the importance of job characteristics and occupational choice in explaining the gender pay gap. This leads to obvious questions: What determines the systematic gender differences in occupational choice? What makes women seek job flexibility and take a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work?

One argument usually put forward is that, to the extent that biological differences in preferences and abilities underpin gender roles, they are the main factors explaining the gender pay gap. In their review of the evidence, Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (2017)[ref]Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available online <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] show that there is limited empirical support for this argument.

To be clear, yes, there is evidence supporting the fact that men and women differ in some key attributes that may affect labor market outcomes. For example standardised tests show that there are <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> statistical gender gaps in maths scores¬†in some countries</a>; and experiments show that women <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid more salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show particular predisposition to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotion potential</a>. However, these observed differences are far from being biologically fixed ‚Äì 'gendering' begins early in life and the evidence shows that preferences and skills are highly malleable. You can influence tastes, and you can certainly teach people to tolerate risk, to do maths, or to negotiate salaries.

What's more, independently of where they come from, Blau and Kahn show that these empirically observed differences can typically only account for a modest portion of the gender pay gap.

In contrast, the evidence does suggest that social norms and culture, which in turn affect preferences, behaviour and incentives to foster specific skills, are key factors in understanding gender differences in labor force participation and wages. You can read more about this in our blog post dedicated to answer the question <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap">'How well do innate gender differences explain the gender pay gap?'</a>.

<strong>Discrimination and bias</strong>

Independently of the exact origin of the unequal distribution of gender roles, it is clear that our recent and even current practices show that these roles persist with the help of institutional enforcement. Goldin (1988),[ref]Goldin, C. (1988). Marriage bars: Discrimination against married women workers, 1920's to 1950's. Available <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w2747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] for instance, examines past prohibitions against the training and employment of married women in the US. She touches on some well-known restrictions, such as those against the training and employment of women as doctors and lawyers, before focusing on the lesser known but even more impactful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'marriage bars'</a> which arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s.¬†These work prohibitions are important because they applied to teaching and clerical jobs ‚Äì occupations that would become the most commonly held among married women after 1950. Around the time the US entered World War II, it is estimated that 87% of all school boards would not hire a married woman and 70% would not retain an unmarried woman who married.

The map shown below highlights that to this day, explicit barriers across the world limit the extent to which women are allowed to do the same jobs as men.[ref]The data in this map, which comes from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, provides a measure of whether there are any specific jobs that non-pregnant and non-nursing women are not allowed to perform. So, for example, a country might be coded as "No" if women are only allowed to work in certain jobs within the mining industry, such as health care professionals within mines, but not as miners.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/can-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-do-the-same-jobs-as-men" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

However, even after explicit barriers are lifted and legal protections put in their place, discrimination and bias can persist in less overt ways. Goldin and Rouse (2000),[ref]Goldin, C., &amp; Rouse, C. (2000). Orchestrating impartiality: The impact of" blind" auditions on female musicians. <em>American Economic Review</em>, 90(4), 715-741. Available <a href="http://affectfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Goldin-Rouse-AER-2000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] for example, look at the adoption of "blind" auditions by orchestras, and show that by using a screen to conceal the identity of a candidate, impartial hiring practices increased the number of women in orchestras by 25% between 1970 and 1996.

Many other studies have found similar evidence of bias in different labor market contexts.[ref]Blau and Kahn (2017) provide a whole list of experimental studies that have found labor-market discrimination. Another early example is from Neumark et al. (1996), who look at discrimination in restaurants. In this case male and female pseudo-job-seekers were given similar CVs to apply for jobs waiting on tables at the same set of restaurants in Philadelphia. The results showed discrimination against women in high-priced restaurants.

The full reference of this study is Neumark, D., Bank, R. J., &amp; Van Nort, K. D. (1996). Sex discrimination in restaurant hiring: An audit study. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 111(3), 915-941.[/ref]

Biases also operate in other spheres of life with strong knock-on effects on labor market outcomes. For example, at the end of World War II <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/what-percentage-of-the-us-public-approves-of-working-wives">only 18% of people in the US thought that a wife should work if her husband was able to support her</a>. This obviously circles back to our earlier point about social norms.
<h3>Policy implications</h3>
In many countries wage inequality between men and women can be reduced by improving the education of women. However, in many countries gender gaps in education have been closed and we still have large gender inequalities in the workforce. What else can be done?

An obvious alternative is fighting discrimination. But the evidence presented above shows that this is not enough. Public policy and management changes on the firm level matter too:

Family-friendly labor-market policies may help. For example, maternity leave coverage can contribute by raising women‚Äôs retention over the period of childbirth, which in turn raises women‚Äôs wages through the maintenance of work experience and job tenure.[ref]Waldfogel, J. (1998). Understanding the "family gap" in pay for women with children. The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 12(1), 137-156.[/ref]

Similarly, early education and childcare can increase the labor force participation of women ‚Äî and reduce gender pay gaps¬†‚Äî by alleviating the unpaid care work undertaken by mothers.[ref]Olivetti, C., &amp; Petrongolo, B. (2017). The economic consequences of family policies: lessons from a century of legislation in high-income countries. The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31(1), 205-230.[/ref]

Additionally, the experience of women's historical advance in specific professions (e.g. pharmacists in the US), suggests that the gender pay gap could also be considerably reduced¬†if firms did not have the incentive to disproportionately reward workers who work long hours, and fixed, non-flexible schedules.[ref]Goldin, C. (2014). A grand gender convergence: Its last chapter. The American Economic Review, 104(4), 1091-1119. Available online <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref] Changing these incentives is of course difficult because it requires reorganizing the workplace. But it is likely to have a large impact on gender inequality, particularly in countries where other measures are already in place.[ref]As we show above, in several nations, such as Sweden and Denmark, a ‚Äúmotherhood penalty‚Äù in earnings exists, even though these nations have generous family policies, including paid family leave and subsidized child care.[/ref]

Implementing these strategies can have a positive self-reinforcing effect. For example, family-friendly labor-market policies that lead to higher labor-force attachment and salaries for women, will raise the returns to women's investment in education ‚Äì so women in future generations will be more likely to invest in education, which will also help narrow gender gaps in labor market outcomes down the line.[ref]For a discussion of this mechanism, see page 814, Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M.

Nevertheless, powerful as these strategies may be, they are only part of the solution. Social norms and culture remain at the heart of family choices and the gender distribution of labor. Achieving equality in opportunities requires ensuring that we change the norms and stereotypes that limit the set of choices available both to men and women. It is difficult, but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evidence</a> shows that social norms, too, can be changed.";s:10:"post_title";s:30:"Why is there a gender pay gap?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:30:"what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-02-19 16:42:07";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-19 16:42:07";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"https://owid.cloud/?p=15918";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:19;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:5:"16069";s:11:"post_author";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2018-02-19 10:32:45";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2018-02-19 10:32:45";s:12:"post_content";s:20077:"<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in articles dedicated to specific topics.

Across the world women tend to take more family responsibilities than men. As a result women tend to be overrepresented in low paying jobs where they are more likely to have the flexibility required to attend to these additional responsibilities.

These two facts ‚Äì¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap/">documented in the previous post on the gender pay gap</a>¬†‚Äì are often used to claim that, since men and women tend to be endowed with different tastes and talents, it follows that most of the observed gender differences in wages stem from biological sex differences. In this blog post I examine the evidence behind these claims.

In a nutshell, here's what I find:
<ul>
 	<li>There is evidence supporting the fact that, statistically speaking, men and women tend to differ in some key aspects, including psychological attributes that may affect labor-market outcomes.</li>
 	<li>There is no consensus on the exact weight that nurture and nature have in determining these differences, but whatever the exact weight, the evidence does show that these attributes are strongly malleable.</li>
 	<li>Regardless of the origin, these differences can only explain a modest part of the gender pay gap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some context regarding the gender distribution of labor</h3>
Before we get into the discussion of whether biological attributes explain wage differences via gender roles, let's get some perspective on the gender distribution of work.

The following chart shows, by country, the female-to-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work, including tasks like taking care of children at home, housework, or doing community work. As can be seen, all over the world there is a radical unbalance in the gender distribution of labor ‚Äì everywhere women take a disproportionate amount of unpaid work.

This is of course closely related to the fact that in most countries there are gender gaps in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation-rates-ILO-WDI">labor force participation</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo?country=CHE+URY+HTI+FRA+CRI+VNM+KOR+PAK+NOR">wages</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-to-male-ratio-of-time-devoted-to-unpaid-care-work" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>"Boys are better at maths"</h3>
Differences in biological attributes that determine our ability to develop 'hard skills', such as maths, are often argued to be at the heart of the gender pay gap.[ref]Hard skills are abilities that can be defined and measured, such as writing, reading or doing maths. By contrast, soft skills are less tangible and harder to measure and quantify.[/ref] Do large gender differences in maths skills really exist? If so, is this because of differences in the attributes we are born with?

Let's look at the data.

Are boys better in the mathematics section of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/test/">PISA standardised test</a>? One could argue that looking at top scores is more relevant here, since top scores are more likely to determine gaps in future professional trajectories ‚Äì for example, gaps in access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'STEM degrees'</a> at the university level.

The chart below shows the share of male and female test-takers scoring at the highest level on the PISA test (that's level 6). As we can see, most countries lie above the diagonal line marking gender parity; so yes, achieving high scores in maths tends to be more common among boys than girls. However, there is huge cross-country variation ‚Äì the differences between countries are much larger than the difference between the sexes. And in many countries the gap is effectively inexistent.[ref]Also importantly: If we focus on gender differences for <em>average</em>, rather than top students, we find that there is not even a clear tendency in favor of boys. (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pisa-average-math-score-male-vs-female" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This interactive chart compares PISA average math scores for boys and girls</a>).[/ref]

Similarly, researchers have found that within countries there is also large geographic variation in gender gaps in test scores. So clearly these gaps in mathematic ability do not seem to be fully determined by biological endowments. [ref]For more on this see Pope, D. G., &amp; Sydnor, J. R. (2010). Geographic variation in the gender differences in test scores. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24(2), 95-108. Available online <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/ref]

Indeed, research looking at the PISA cross-country results suggests that improved social conditions for women are related to improved math performance by girls.[ref]Guiso, L., Monte, F., Sapienza, P., &amp; Zingales, L. (2008). Culture, gender, and math. SCIENCE-NEW YORK THEN WASHINGTON-, 320(5880), 1164.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/pisa-share-top-math-male-vs-femal" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Not only statistical gaps in test scores vary substantially across societies ‚Äì they also vary substantially across time. This suggests that social factors play a large role in explaining  difference between the sexes.

In the US, for example, the gender gap in mathematics has narrowed in recent decades.[ref]A number of papers have documented the narrowing of gender gaps in test scores. See, for example, Hyde, J. S., Lindberg, S. M., Linn, M. C., Ellis, A. B., & Williams, C. C. (2008). Gender similarities characterize math performance. Science, 321(5888), 494-495. Available online <a href="http://dericbownds.net/uploaded_images/hyde.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] And this narrowing took place as high school curricula of boys and girls became more similar. The following chart shows this: In the US boys in 1957 took far more math and science courses than did girls; but by 1992 there was virtual parity in almost all science and math courses. 

More importantly for the question at hand, gender gaps in 'hard skills' are not large enough to¬†explain the gender gaps in earnings. In their review of the evidence, Blau and Kahn (2017)[ref]Blau, Francine D., and Lawrence M. Kahn. 2017. "The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations." Journal of Economic Literature, 55(3): 789-865. Available <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20160995">here</a>.[/ref] conclude that gaps in test scores in the US are too small to explain much of the gender pay at any point in time.

So, taken together, the evidence suggests that statistical gaps in maths test scores are both relatively small and heavily influenced by social and environmental factors.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/male-to-female-ratio-courses-in-usa" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h3>"It's about personality"</h3>
Biological differences in <em>tastes</em> (e.g. preferences for 'people' over 'things'), <em>psychological attributes</em> (e.g. 'risk aversion') and <em>soft skills</em> (e.g. the ability to get along with others) are also often argued to be at the heart of the gender pay gap.

There are hundreds of studies trying to establish whether there are gender differences in preferences, personality traits and 'soft skills'. The quality and general relevance (i.e. the internal and external validity) of these studies is the subject of much discussion, as illustrated in the recent debate that ensued from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber">Google Memo affair</a>.

<a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/2017/08/10/the-google-memo-what-does-the-research-say-about-gender-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent article from the 'Heterodox Academy</a>', which was produced specifically in the context of the Google Memo, provides a fantastic overview of the evidence on this topic and the key points of contention among scholars.

For the purpose of this blog post, let's focus on the review of the evidence presented in Blau and Kahn (2017) ‚Äì their review is particularly helpful because they focus on gender differences in the context of labor markets.

Blau and Kahn point out that, yes, researchers have found statistical differences between men and women that are important in the context of labor-market outcomes. For example, studies have found <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979391406700202?journalCode=ilra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistical gender differences in 'people skills'</a> (i.e. ability to listen, communicate, and relate to others). Similarly, experimental studies have found that <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women more often avoid salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show particular predisposition</a> to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotability. But are the origins of these differences mainly biological or are they social?¬†And are they strong enough to explain pay gaps?

The available evidence here suggests these factors can only explain a relatively small fraction of the observed differences in wages.[ref]Blau and Kahn write: "While findings such as those in table 7 ['Selected Studies Assessing the Role of Psychological Traits in Accounting for the Gender Pay Gap'] are informative in elucidating some of the possible omitted factors that lie behind gender differences in wages as well as the unexplained gap in traditional wage regressions, in general, the results suggest that these factors do not account for a large portion of either the raw or unexplained gender gap."[/ref] And they are anyway far from being purely biological ‚Äì preferences and skills are highly malleable and 'gendering' begins early in life.[ref]For a discussion of 'gendering' see West, C., &amp; Zimmerman, D. H. (1987). Doing gender. Gender &amp; society, 1(2), 125-151.[/ref]

Here is a concrete example: Leibbrandt and List (2015)[ref]Leibbrandt, A., &amp; List, J. A. (2014). Do women avoid salary negotiations? Evidence from a large-scale natural field experiment. Management Science, 61(9), 2016-2024.[/ref] did an experiment in which they assessed how men and women reacted to job advertisements. They found that although men were more likely to negotiate than women when there was no explicit statement that wages were negotiable, the gender difference disappeared and even reversed when it was explicitly stated that wages were negotiable. This suggests that it is not as much about 'talent', as it is about norms and rules.
<h3>"A man should earn more than his wife"</h3>
The experiment in which researchers found that gender differences in negotiation attitudes disappeared when it was explicitly stated that wages were negotiable, emphasizes the important role that social norms and culture play in labor-market outcomes.

These concepts may seem abstract: What do social norms and culture actually look like in the context of the gender pay gap?

The reproduction of stereotypes through everyday positive enforcement can be seen in a range of aspects: A study analyzing 124 prime-time television programs in the US found that female characters continue to inhabit interpersonal roles with romance, family, and friends, while male characters enact work-related roles.[ref]Lauzen, M. M., Dozier, D. M., &amp; Horan, N. (2008). Constructing gender stereotypes through social roles in prime-time television. Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, 52(2), 200-214.[/ref] In the realm of children‚Äôs books, a study of 5,618 books found that compared to females, males are represented nearly twice as often in titles and 1.6 times as often as central characters.[ref]McCabe, J., Fairchild, E., Grauerholz, L., Pescosolido, B. A., &amp; Tope, D. (2011). Gender in twentieth-century children‚Äôs books: Patterns of disparity in titles and central characters. Gender &amp; society, 25(2), 197-226.[/ref] Qualitative research shows that even in the home, parents are often enforcers of gender norms ‚Äì especially when it comes to fathers endorsing masculinity in male children.[ref]Kane, E. W. (2006). ‚ÄúNo way my boys are going to be like that!‚Äù Parents‚Äô responses to children‚Äôs gender nonconformity. Gender &amp; Society, 20(2), 149-176.[/ref]

Of particular relevance in the context of labor markets, social norms also often take the form of specific behavioral prescriptions such as "a man should earn more than his wife".

The following chart depicts the distribution of the share of the household income earned by the wife, across married couples in the US. Consistent with the idea that "a man should earn more than his wife", the data shows a sharp drop at 0.5, the point where the wife starts to earn more than the husband. This is the result of two factors. First, it is about the matching of men and women before they marry ‚Äì 'matches' in which the woman has higher earning potential are less common. And second, it is a result of choices after marriage ‚Äì the researchers show that married women with higher earning potential than their husband often stay out of the labor force, or take 'below-potential' jobs.[ref]More precisely, the authors find that in couples where the wife‚Äôs potential income is likely to exceed her husband‚Äôs (based on the income that would be predicted for her observed characteristics), the wife is less likely to be in the labor force, and if she does work, her income is lower than predicted.[/ref]

The authors of the study from which this chart is taken explored the data in more detail and found that in couples where the wife earns more than the husband, the wife spends more time on household chores, so the gender gap in unpaid care work is even larger; and these couples are also less satisfied with their marriage and are more likely to divorce than couples where the wife earns less than the husband.

The empirical exploration in this study highlights the remarkable power that gender norms and identity have on labor-market outcomes.

<h3>So what?</h3>
Does it actually matter if social norms and culture are important determinants of gender roles and labor-market outcomes? Are social norms in our contemporary societies really less fixed than biological traits?

Based on the available research, I believe the answer to these questions is yes, and yes. There is evidence that social norms can be actively and rapidly changed.

Here is a concrete example: Jensen and Oster (2009)[ref]Jensen, R., &amp; Oster, E. (2009). The power of TV: Cable television and women's status in India. In¬†<em>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>, 124(3), 1057-1094. Available <a href="http://demo.ncaer.org/popuppages/EventDetails/E10Jan2009/neemrana-paper12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>[/ref] find that the introduction of cable television in India led to a significant decrease in the reported acceptability of domestic violence towards women and son preference, as well as increases in women‚Äôs autonomy and decreases in fertility.

Of course, TV is a small aspect of all the big things that matter for social norms. But this study is important for the discussion because it is hard to study how social norms can be changed. TV introduction is a rare opportunity to see how a group that is exposed to a driver of social change actually changes.

As Jensen and Oster point out, most popular cable tv shows in India feature urban settings where lifestyles differ radically from those in rural areas. For example, many female characters on popular soap operas have more education, marry later and have smaller families than most women in rural areas. And, similarly, many female characters in these tv shows are featured working outside the home as professionals, running businesses or are shown in other positions of authority.

The bar chart below shows how cable access changed attitudes towards the self-reported preference for their child to be a son. As the authors note, <em>"reported desire for the next child to be a son is relatively unchanged in areas with no change in cable status, but it decreases sharply between 2001 and 2002 for villages that get cable in 2002, and between 2002 and 2003 (but notably not between 2001 and 2002) for those that get cable in 2003. For both measures of attitudes, the changes are large and striking, and correspond closely to the timing of introduction of cable."</em>

To conclude: The evidence suggests that biological differences are not a key driver of gender inequality in labor-market outcomes; while social norms and culture ‚Äì which in turn affect preferences, behavior and incentives to foster specific skills ‚Äì are very important.

This matters for policy because social norms are not fixed ‚Äì they can be influenced in a number of ways, including through intergenerational learning processes, exposure to alternative norms, and activism such as that which propelled the women's movement.[ref]Regarding intergenerational transmission of gender roles, see Fern√°ndez, R. (2013). Cultural change as learning: The evolution of female labor force participation over a century. The American Economic Review, 103(1), 472-500.

The differences between the economies of Switzerland and Guatemala go beyond differences in size. The Swiss economy has different inputs that can be used to produce a very different mix of outputs. In other words, the Swiss economy has different ‚Äòproductive capabilities‚Äô.

Productive capabilities are important to understand economic development. But, what exactly are productive capabilities? And how can we measure them?

Ricardo Hausmann and Cesar Hidalgo argue that productive capabilities are all the inputs, technologies and ideas that, in combination, determine the frontiers of what an economy can produce. They argue that productive capabilities include all sorts of things: infrastructure, land, laws, machines, people, books, and collective knowledge.

Since measuring and comparing such diverse and complex productive capabilities is difficult, Hausmann and Hidalgo <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/26/10570.full.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">propose</a> using a proxy, called the <em>Economic Complexity Index</em> (ECI), which tries to measure capabilities indirectly by looking at the mix of products that countries export. 

The assumption is that productive capabilities determine the number and quality of products that a country can export; so export bundles tell us something about the underlying productive capabilities. For example, we might infer that Switzerland and Japan have similar productive capabilities, because they are both able to produce a similar set of goods.

To use a metaphor: If economies are like restaurants, then productive capabilities are all the stuff that is needed in the kitchen; so the <em>Economic Complexity Index</em> ranks the restaurants by comparing the menus, rather than by comparing the recipes, food and people behind the kitchen doors.

In a nutshell, the ECI is an algorithm such that (i) restaurants that serve a more diverse and sophisticated menu are scored higher, and (ii) restaurants that serve similar menus have similar scores. 

<h4>A closer look at the Economic Complexity Index</h4>

The ECI takes data on exports, and reduces a country‚Äôs economic system into two dimensions: (i) The 'diversity' of products in the export basket, and (ii) the ‚Äòubiquity‚Äô of products in the export basket. Diversity is the number of products that a country can export competitively. And ubiquity is the number of countries that are able to export a product competitively.

To measure these two dimensions, the ECI uses a cross-country export matrix. That is, a table with countries in the rows and product categories in the columns, so that each cell in the table shows the value of country-product exports.

Loosely speaking, the least complex countries, at the bottom of the ECI rank, are those that export very few different types of products (i.e. have export baskets that are not diversified) and those products that they do export are produced in many other countries (i.e. export baskets that load heavily on just a few ubiquitous products). 

By this logic, Germany ranks high in economic complexity, because it exports many different kinds of sophisticated things that are only produced by a handful of other countries with similarly diversified productive capacities. 

The following chart shows ECI rankings for all countries in the world, over time.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/economic-complexity-rankings?year=2012" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

MIT's <a href="https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/">Observatory of Economic Complexity</a> and Harvard's <a href="http://globe.cid.harvard.edu/">Atlas of Economic Complexity</a> are both great data visualisation websites that have much more data on ECI, countries' trade relationships, and the composition of traded goods.

<h4>From economic complexity to economic growth</h4>

The chart below shows the relationship between ECI rankings and GDP per capita. As we can see, there is a clear correlation: richer countries tend to rank higher in the ECI. The countries on the lower ranks of the ECI are much poorer than the high-ranked countries in the top-left corner.
 
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/eci-ranking-vs-gdp-per-capita" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

In the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/106/26/10570.full.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">academic paper</a> where Hidalgo and Hausmann introduced their concept of ‚Äòeconomic complexity‚Äô, they noted that the correlation between the ECI and GDP per capita is very robust; and they showed that, beyond this, the ECI actually predicts economic <em>growth</em> after statistically controlling for other baseline country characteristics. So countries with higher economic complexity than their level of GDP per capita would suggest, can be expected to grow faster. 

Consider, for example, Malaysia: As we can see in the chart above, Malaysia is further left along the horizontal axis than other countries located at the same height along the vertical axis. So, statistically speaking, it is likely that Malaysia will grow faster than these other countries.

The intuition for why economic complexity predicts growth can be understood in terms of unexploited productive potential. Countries that are below the income expected from their capability endowment, are countries that will likely shift towards the product-mix that is feasible with their existing capabilities, and which richer countries have already successfully developed.

This takes us to the main lesson from economic complexity: Different types of exports are associated with different economic outcomes. [ref]It's not only about GDP growth. In a recent paper Hartmann, D., Guevara, M.R., Jara-Figueroa, C., Aristaran, M., Hidalgo, C.A., suggest the ECI is a predictor of income inequality levels. They show that countries exporting more economically complex products have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting more ubiquitous products. Available online <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15309876">here</a>.[/ref]

This is in line with the well-studied phenomenon of ‚Äòpremature de-industrialization‚Äô. Emerging economies that fail to develop their manufacturing sector as they grow, are likely to suffer from lower growth prospects later down the line, because manufacturing industries tend to be particularly conducive to productivity growth.

<h4>What does this mean in terms of economic policy? </h4>

The fact that different types of exports are associated with different economic outcomes suggests that policymakers should try to focus on relaxing specific productivity constraints in key sectors that are likely to unlock growth potential. 

Does this imply that countries that are less economically complex, as determined by the ECI, should focus on diversification? Not necessarily.

The <em>type</em> rather than the <em>number</em> of industries and occupations concentrated in a region might matter more for economic prosperity. So the objective of industrial policy should not be diversification per se.[ref]For more details on this see Mealy, P., Farmer, J., & Teytelboym, A. (2018). A New Interpretation of the Economic Complexity Index. Available online <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08245.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

Pinning down the ‚Äòkey sectors‚Äô and finding ‚Äòbinding constraints‚Äô is obviously difficult. But it is likely more cost-effective than a one-size-fits-all approach to industrial policy.";s:10:"post_title";s:54:"How and why should we study ‚Äòeconomic
