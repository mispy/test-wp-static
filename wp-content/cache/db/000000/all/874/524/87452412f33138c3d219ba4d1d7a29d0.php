According to the publicly available data discussed in more detail below, Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where child labour is most prevalent. While absolute numbers are still high, particularly in¬†those¬†countries with the lowest standards of living, from a historical viewpoint¬†there are concrete examples of countries that managed to virtually eliminate widespread child labour in the course of a century.¬†The United Kingdom is a case in point. In terms of recent developments,¬†on the aggregate¬†trends show a significant reduction in child labour over the last two decades,¬†albeit with¬†wide dispersion in the progress that different countries have achieved.

<!--------------------------------------HISTORICAL PERSP -->
<h3>Historical perspective</h3>
Historical studies suggest that child work was widespread in Europe in the 19th century, but declined very rapidly at the turn of the 20th century. The available historical evidence seems consistent with the fact that industrialisation in western European countries initially increased the demand for child labour, but then eventually contributed towards its elimination (see Cunningham, H., &amp; Viazzo, P. P. (1996) [ref] Cunningham, Hugh, and Pier Paolo Viazzo. <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/ucf/hisper/hisper96-1.html">Child Labour in Historical Perspective 1800-1985: Case Studies from Europe, Japan and Colombia</a>.

<h3>Global overview today</h3>
A complete and up-to-date overview of recent global trends in child labour can be found in the ILO's report <em><a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf"> Marking Progress Against Child Labour (2013)</a></em>[ref]ILO-IPEC, <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf">Marking progress against child labour - Global estimates and trends 2000-2012</a> / International Labour Office, International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) - Geneva: ILO, 2013.[/ref] produced by the organization's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). This report presents global estimates and trends for the period 2000-2012. The following visualization, based on this source, presents the recent changes in the world-wide share of children (ages 5-17) in employment.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7277"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7277" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_child-labor-global-post-2000-750x525.png" alt="child-labor-global-post-2000" width="750" height="525" /></a><a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/171" target="_blank">view the interactive version of the same chart (with access to the data)</a></p>
Independently, the ILO Programme on Estimates and Projections of the Economically Active Population (EPEAP) has been producing statistics on labour force participation (for adults and children) since 1950, through the ILO's cross-country database known as LABORSTA. Basu (1999)[ref]Basu, Kaushik. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.651&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Child labor: cause, consequence, and cure, with remarks on international labor standards.</a> Journal of Economic literature 37.3 (1999): 1083-1119.[/ref] uses this source to produce global labour force participation rates for children (ages 10-14) in the period 1950-1995. The following visualization presents the corresponding trend using the data published in Basu (1999). While these estimates are informative about child labour, they cannot be linked directly to those of children in employment published by the ILO IPEC for the period 2000-2012 due to issues of comparability; specifically, the IPEC and EPEAP estimates discussed above rely on different survey instruments covering a different set of countries, and break up the relevant population in different age brackets.[ref]Many studies rely on the LABORSTA data to shed light on the extent of child labour in the 20th century. However, this source is generally believed to understate the extent of child labour, since data is not collected for work inside the household (not even market work)[/ref] Nonetheless, regardless of discrepancies between these two sources, the trends tell a consistent story: the last fifty years have seen a marked improvement in terms of the share of economically active children in the world.

Contrary to popular perception, most working children in the world are unpaid family workers, rather than paid workers in manufacturing establishments or other forms of wage employment.

<!--------------------------------------COUNTRY TRENDS -->
<h3>Recent developments</h3>
The visualization below shows the share of children (7-14 years) in employment for a number of countries (for the years in which data is publicly available¬†from¬†the World Bank consolidated dataset). As it can be appreciated, the prevalence of child labour varies widely by country; for instance, the share of children in employment (here defined in terms of being economically active for one hour a week) was fifteen times larger in Uganda than in Turkey according to 2005 estimates. While most countries exhibit a downward trend, many countries are lagging.

Switch to the map view in this chart to compare the level of child labour between countries.¬† Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where child labour is most prevalent, and also the region where progress has been slowest and least consistent.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/160" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

As shall be discussed in more detail, child labour is by definition problematic whenever it interferes with the children's development. Because of this it is informative to study child labour specifically when it is coupled with absence from school. The following visualization shows the share of children in employment who work only (i.e. those children who are economically active <em>and</em> do not attend school). Again, there is wide variation across countries; while in Latin America the majority of children who are economically active also attend school, in sub-Saharan Africa this is not the case. However, trends are encouraging on the whole, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where the problem is most acute. The next section exploring correlates, determinants and consequences of child labour, provides more information about the link between work and school attendance.

<!--------------------------------------GENDER-->
<h3>Current gender gaps</h3>

<!--------------------------------------CORRELATES -->
<!----------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Correlates, Determinants, &amp; Consequences</h2>
This section discusses the relationship between children's work and two crucial¬†variables: schooling and income. Low school attendance¬†is typically considered one of the most important consequences of child labour, while low household¬†income is¬†considered an important¬†determinant. See Schultz and Strauss (2008) for a discussion of academic evidence informing other potential determinants and consequences.

<!--------------------------------------SCHOOLING -->
<h3>Child labour and schooling</h3>
As it has already been mentioned, child labour is particularly problematic to the extent that it hinders the children's development, notably by interfering with schooling. Since time is a scarce resource, the extent to which children's employment is linked to school attendance depends on the type and number of hours worked. The following visualization taken from Schultz and Strauss (2008) presents evidence of this link using data from UNICEF‚Äôs Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2000 and 2001); it plots school attendance rates for children 10‚Äì14 against total hours worked in the last week (by type of work) with 95 percent confidence intervals (labeled CI and plotted in lighter shades). The steepest part of the pictured curves are in the range 20-45 hours, suggesting‚Äîas one would naturally expect‚Äîthat it is most difficult for a child to attend school when approaching¬†full-time work. This evidence also shows that there are no significant difference by domestic or marketed work.

The above relationship between work and schooling is informative about the impact of children's work on schooling, but is not sufficient to establish causality; there are many potential economic and cultural factors that simultaneously influence both schooling and work decisions; and in any case, the direction of the relationships is not obvious‚Äîdo children work because they are not attending school, or do they fail to attend school <em>because</em> they are working? A number of academic studies have tried to establish causality by attempting to find a factor (an 'instrumental variable') that only affects whether a child works without affecting how the family values other uses of the child's time (e.g. Rosati, F., Rossi, M. (2003)[ref] Rosati, F., Rossi, M. (2003). <a href="ftp://www.ceistorvergata.it/repec/rpaper/No-25-Rosati,Rossi.pdf">Children‚Äôs working hours and school enrollment: Evidence from Pakistan and Nicaragua</a>. World Bank Economic Review 17, 283‚Äì295. [/ref]; Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006)[ref]Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006). <a href="http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/orazem/Child%20Labor%20in%20Latin%20America.pdf">Child labor and school achievement in Latin America</a>. World Bank Economic Review 20, 31‚Äì54.[/ref])While these studies can be criticized on the grounds of the validity of the instrumental variables used, they seem to agree on the fact that there is a stronger association between child labour and schooling than the raw data would suggest.
<!--------------------------------------GDP------>
<h3>Child labour and¬†income</h3>
Cross-country data on child labour and economic growth suggests a strong negative correlation between economic status and child labour. The following visualization depicts the cross-country incidence of child labour (share of children ages 7-14 involved in economic activity) against GDP per capita (PPP adjusted GDP per capita in international dollars). To provide some context regarding the absolute number of children, each country's observation is pictured as a circle where the size of the circle represents population aged 5-14.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/179" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

This evidence cannot be interpreted causally; as before, countries differ in many aspects that may be associated with child labour choices and income. But there are a number of reasons why, conceptually, child labour might be indeed <em>caused</em> by poor living conditions. For example, children might only work if the parents are unable to meet subsistence conditions; or it could be the case that parents allocate more of the children's time to schooling as they afford the necessary inputs for schooling (text-books, uniforms, etc).

Partly following this logic, several countries have implemented cash transfer programmes in an attempt to discourage child labour and increase schooling. The idea behind these programmes is that the cash transfers are conditioned on a number of¬†desirable actions, including sending children to school; and in doing so,¬†they lower the relative costs of schooling and raise family income. ¬†Schultz (2004)[ref]Schultz, T.W. (2004). <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/growth_pdf/cdp834.pdf">School subsidies for the poor: Evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program</a>. Journal of Development Economics 74, 199‚Äì250.[/ref] evaluates one such program in Mexico¬†(the so-called 'Progresa' program) and ¬†finds a significant reduction in wage and market work associated with eligibility for Progresa. Similar findings have been found in other countries as well. The literature often refers to these programmes as the prime example of "collaborative measures" against child labour: non-coercive interventions that alter the economic environment of decision makers in order to make them more willing to let children stay out of work.

<!--------------------------------------DEFINITIONS -->
<h2 id="DataQuality">Definitions, Measurement &amp; Data Quality</h2>
<h3>Definitions and measurement</h3>
Broadly speaking, the term ‚Äúchild labour‚Äù is defined as the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood and dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development.

The ILO defines child labour as work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children; and that interferes with the children‚Äôs schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school, either by obliging them to leave school prematurely, or by requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work (a general definition along these lines can be found in the ILO's <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm"> Child Labour website </a>). The ILO‚Äôs Convention No. 138, adopted in 1973 and ratified by most countries of the world, stipulates the relevant ages that different countries use to define child labour.

Strictly speaking, whether or not a given job falls within this definition¬†of "child labour" depends on the details of the actual context‚Äîthe child‚Äôs age, the type and hours of tasks performed, the conditions under which they are performed. In fact, in the strictest sense, a counterfactual (i.e. what the child would be doing in the absence of work) would be necessary to determine precisely whether an activity is harmful to a child‚Äôs development. Since accounting for all of these factors is extremely¬†challenging in practice, it is common for studies to concentrate on employment in general‚Äîthrough indicators constructed from surveys of economic activity by age groups‚Äî, while leaving room for exploring the consequences of such employment (e.g. school attendance). This is the approach followed¬†here: ¬†we have been referring to¬†"children in employment" as¬†those engaged in any economic activity (for at least one hour during the last week), hence including work in market production as well as certain types of non-market production (e.g. the production of goods and services for own use).

It's important to bear in mind that many studies distinguish between ‚Äúchildren in child labour‚Äù and ‚Äúchildren in employment‚Äù, while using the terms ‚Äúworking children‚Äù, ‚Äúchildren in economic activity‚Äù and ‚Äúchildren in employment‚Äù interchangeably. In such cases, the former (‚Äúchildren in child labour‚Äù) are considered a subset of the latter (‚Äúchildren in employment‚Äù or any of the aforementioned interchangeable terms). More specifically, children in child labour include those in <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/WorstFormsofChildLabour/lang--en/index.htm worst forms of child labour "> worst forms of child labour</a> and children in employment below the minimum age, excluding children in permissible light work‚Äîwhere "permissible light work" is defined as any non-hazardous work by children (ages 12 to 14) of less than 14 hours during the reference week (for more details see ILO-IPEC, Diallo, Y., et al. (2013)[ref] ILO-IPEC, Diallo, Y., et al. <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_IPEC_PUB_23015/lang--en/index.htm">Global child labour trends 2008 to 2012</a>. ILO International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). (Geneva, ILO, 2013).[/ref]). While standardized cross-country data is not publicly available for "children in child labour"‚Äîor other definitions using other working hour thresholds‚Äî, it is possible to obtain raw data on children's time allocation from UNICEF and ILO (see Data Sources below). Studying how many hours children work¬†is important considering that one hour of work in a week, without any further context, constitutes a rather slack measure of child labour.
<h3>Data quality</h3>
Schultz and Strauss (2008) provide a¬†complete account of the¬†particular challenges that arise from measuring children employment through household surveys. The authors highlight difficulties arising from coverage (i.e. capturing the most vulnerable children through random sampling) and accuracy (i.e. misreported¬†hours worked and sensitivity to the recall period used).

Specifically regarding the information published by the World Bank in their World Development Indicators, it is important to highlight that, while definitions are standardized (children in employment are always defined as those children aged 7-14 involved in economic activity for at least one hour in the reference week of the corresponding survey), the data-collection instruments are not standardized across the different sub-sources feeding¬†the consolidated¬†dataset. It is because of this that many¬†policy reports (such as the much-referenced¬†report <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf"> Marking Progress Against Child Labour (2013) </a>) 'homogenize' the data before reporting estimates, by correcting for discrepancies in the underlying survey instruments. Those visualizations presented here that use the consolidated data published by the World Bank have not been corrected.

Issues of consistency across different¬†¬†survey instruments in the World Bank consolidated data¬†¬†can help us explain country-specific patterns that are otherwise difficult to interpret. Consider the case of India. As it can be appreciated in the following visualization, the incidence of child labour in¬†India seems to jump up in 2006, only to go back in 2010 to the levels that would have been predicted with the observations from 2000 and 2005. After checking the <a href="http://www.ucw-project.org/Pages/survey_list.aspx"> survey catalogue</a>, it becomes clear that the estimates for 2006 come from the country's Demographic and Health Survey, while those for the other years come from consecutive rounds of the National Sample Survey. Cases such as this illustrate¬†why current academic studies typically rely on data stemming from a single survey instrument, such as UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys.

<h5>ILO - ILOSTAT (formerly ILO - LABORSTA)</h5>
The ILO Programme on Estimates and Projections of the Economically Active Population (EPEAP) has been producing statistics on labour force participation (for adults and children) since 1945, through the database known as ILOSTAT (formerly LABORSTA). Many studies rely on the LABORSTA/ILOSTAT data to shed light on the extent of child labour in the 20th century, before ILO started producing specialized child labour data. LABORSTA/ILOSTAT data¬†is however problematic as a source to measure child labour, since data on work inside the household (even market work) are often not collected. Schultz and Strauss (2008) say that this source is not reliably useful for analyzing changes in child labor over time, given that the survey instruments, coverage, and estimation methodologies are¬†not designed for this purpose.[ref] The International Handbook Of Development Economics (Volume 2, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2008) provides in its chapter 51 estimates of labour force participation rates for children (ages 10-14) for the years 1960, 1980 and 2000. Although the authors do not provide details regarding their source, the estimates are likely coming from LABORSTA for a subset of 134 countries categorized by the authors as 'developing'.[/ref]

With the collapse of the European empires after the Second World War, instances of civil war increased globally while Europe remained relatively conflict free. Civil wars are often characterised as more brutal conflicts with a greater number of casualties. Understanding the causes of civil conflicts has become an  increasingly important line of research given the destructive and frequent nature of civil conflicts.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>

Over the course of the 20th century, the deaths from civil wars (as defined by PRIO-UPSALA dataset) first spike at the end of the First World War, and flare up again in the interwar years as well as the end of the Second World War. The end of the WWI saw the collapse of the Ottoman, Autro-Hungarian, German and Russian Empires, as well as the beginning of the end of the remaining European powers. The collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 led to the Russian Civil War and the deaths of millions of people. What is more, many modern conflicts in the Middle East (both civil and conventional wars) have their roots in the division of the Ottoman Empire.

The rising number and intensity of conflicts between the end of WWII and the collapse of the Berlin Wall (1945-89) is associated with the Cold War. The struggle for global superiority between the United States and the Soviet Union led both to engage in proxy wars with one another. Both the Korean War and Vietnam War began as civil wars but ended up drawing in resources from the US and Soviet Union. The following two graphs show precisely how the number of civil wars increased from the end of the Second World War before peaking in the 1990s and the distribution of conflict lengths. During this peak, around a third of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa were engaged in civil war. James Fearon and David Laitin explain the peak in the 1990s as the result of the accumulation of protracted conflicts:[ref]Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Ethnicity, insurgency, and civil war." <em>American political science review</em> 97, no. 01 (2003): 75-90. Available online <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055403000534">here</a>.[/ref]

<blockquote cite="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055403000534">The prevalence of internal war in the 1990s is mainly the result of an accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s rather than a sudden change associated with a new, post-Cold War international system. Decolonization from the 1940s through the 1970s gave birth to a large number of financially, bureaucratically, and militarily weak states.</blockquote>

The following visualisation from The Economist displays a ranking of the 100 deadliest civil wars and internal conflicts since WWII. This chart neatly displays the variance of civil wars; many conflicts are relatively short-lived but some have lasted decades; the deadliest civil war had 600 combatant deaths per thousand while the lowest ranked conflict had only 1.5. This graph and the preceding one together show just how common internal wars are and the high degree of persistence in these conflicts. Between 1960-2006, Blattman and Miguel estimate that 20% of nations have experienced at least ten years of civil war.

Another factor to consider is the number of new countries established during the postwar period. The breakup of the remaining empires after WWII led to the establishment of new 'independent' states.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants & Consequences</h2>

<h3>Greed versus Grievance: Collier and Hoeffler</h3>

One of the most influential studies on civil war argues that the causes for such conflicts are primarily economic and not grievance based. This theory rejects the idea that civil wars are caused by ethnic, religious or other socio-demographic factors. Instead civil wars are the result of rational individualistic assessments of the costs and benefits of conflict as well as the likelihood of success. The economic gains from conflicts are often control of resources and political power.

Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler tested this theory empirically using data from civil wars over the period 1960-99.[ref]Collier, Paul, and Anke Hoeffler. "Greed and grievance in civil war." <em>Oxford economic papers</em> 56, no. 4 (2004): 563-595. Available online <a href="http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/4/563.short" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] They find that the opportunities model performs much better in predicting the onset of civil war compared with the grievance model, which they find adds little explanatory power. Their main findings are summarised below:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability of finance</strong>: Primary commodity exports substantially increase the risk of conflict, and the authors interpret this as the effect of opportunities to extort. Diasporas also increase the risk of conflict renewal, which is interpreted to be the result of diaspora financing. This type of financing was a particular feature of the Sri Lankan Civil War where the Tamil Tigers received significant funding from the diaspora population.
</li>

	<li><strong>Opportunity cost of rebellion</strong>: Measures of opportunity cost such as male secondary education enrollment, per capita income and the growth rate all have significant conflict reduction effects. These variables collectively proxy the foregone earnings if individuals choose to rebel.</li>

	<li><strong>Military advantage</strong>: Population dispersion increases the risk of conflict because it provides the rebels with military advantage.</li>

	<li><strong>Population size</strong>: A large population increases the risk of conflict. The reason for this effect is left open to interpretation and may reflect increased opportunities or grievances.</li>

	<li><strong>Grievances</strong>: Inequality, political rights, ethnic polarisation and religious fractionalisation were all insignificant variables in predicting conflict. They find that only ethnic dominance, where one ethnic group is the majority, increases the risk of conflict. </li>

	<li><strong>Time</strong>: Time since the last conflict reduces the risk of new conflict, suggesting time can heal the wounds of civil war.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Insurgency: Fearon and Laitin</h3>

James Fearon and David Laitin agree with Collier and Hoeffler's general analysis that economic factors are the main drivers of civil conflicts, but suggest that insurgency plays a large part.[ref]Fearon, James D., and David D. Laitin. "Ethnicity, insurgency, and civil war." <em>American political science review</em> 97, no. 01 (2003): 75-90. Available online <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055403000534">here</a>.[/ref] Fearon and Laitin define insurgency as "a technology of military conflict characterized by small, lightly armed bands practicing guerrilla warfare from rural base areas." Fearon and Laitin characterise most civil conflicts as the result of weak and corrupt governments fighting insurgencies protected by difficult terrain (mountains, desert, jungle) and a sympathetic population. In many cases, these insurgencies are supported by foreign diasporas or sympathetic groups and the revenues generated from appropriated commodities.

<h2>Data Quality & Definitions</h2>

The Correlates of War (COW) project produces the most comprehensive and widely used dataset on civil war. A basic requirement for classification is that: "intra-state war must... involve sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related combatant fatalities within a twelve month period."

The classification of civil wars and intra-state conflicts is a delicate problem and the dataset differentiates between many different types of conflict:

<ol>
	<li>Civil wars involving the government of the state against a non-state entity

<ol type="a">
	<li>Conflict to control the central government</li>
	<li>Disputes over local issues</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Regional internal wars involving the government of a regional subunit against a non-state entity</li>

	<li>Intercommunal wars involving a combat between/among two or more non-state entities within the state
</li>
</ol>

When the government is involved as an entity in the conflict, it must either commit 1000 troops to the war or suffer 100 battle-related deaths. The threshold for non-state armed groups is lower at 100 armed personnel or 25 battle-related deaths. Full details on the classification rules can be found in <a href="http://cow.dss.ucdavis.edu/data-sets/COW-war/intra-state-war-data-codebook" target="_blank">Inter-state Wars (Version 4.0): Definitions and Variables by Meredith Reid Sarkees</a>.

<h3>Global CO2 emissions</h3>
The following chart presents a global perspective and shows the impact of the the Industrial Revolution when production and transportation were transformed. At first solid fuels were mostly responsible for the CO2 emissions, but over the past few decades, liquid fuels have produced approximately as many metric tons of carbon emissions as solid fuels.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h4>200 years of colonial history</h4>
Above we have shown all of today's countries that were part of a colonial empire in purple. This map now shows which other country was the colonial power that ruled over another country. Press the 'Play' at the bottom to see the change over time.

The borders shown throughout this visualisation are today's borders. It would be preferable to show the historical borders and the changes over time; the current solution is a limitation of our technical framework that cannot (yet) show border changes.<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/colonialism-and-imperialism" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>The end of colonialism</h3>
This visualisation presents the above data on the colonial powers in a time perspective. For each country that became independent over the last 2 centuries you see the former colonial or imperial power and the year of independence.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/First-year-of-independence-by-colony-with-legend.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8756" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/First-year-of-independence-by-colony-with-legend-507x550.png" alt="first-year-of-independence-by-colony-with-legend" width="507" height="550" /></a>
<h3>Share of World Population Living in Colonized Countries</h3>
This visualization shows estimates of the number of people governed by different political regimes in dark purple. The chart also shows for each point in time under which type of political regime the remaining world population lived.
Throughout the 19th century around one third of the world population lived in countries that were colonized by imperial powers. This changed completely over the second half of the 20th centuries when the former colonies became independent.

By clicking on 'Absolute', the following graph shows the number of people living in different regimes over the last two centuries.

<h2>Measurement, Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2>
In this entry we rely on the data presented by Wimmer and Min (2006) ‚Äì see below for the reference. A major issue with the categorization of countries as colonies is that sometimes it only be done in retrospect ‚Äì after the fact that the country became independent. While some countries were politically and officially referred to as colonies it is more difficult for countries that were not explicitly referred to as such.

<p>According to the source "energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport." The World Bank's source for this data is the International Energy Agency that publishes the data at <a href="http://www.iea.org/stats/index.asp">www.iea.org</a>.<br />

<p>The levels of violence in prehistoric times (archeological evidence) and in non-state societies (ethnographic evidence)¬† was much higher than in modern state societies and in the world today. This is what the data tells us, and I have visualized this evidence in a series of barcharts.</p>
<p><a title="Homicides" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/violence-rights/homicides/">Homicide rates</a> for modern times are routinely published by statistical offices or other state agencies, and research institutes publish <a title="War and Peace after 1945" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/war-peace/war-and-peace-after-1945/">reliable data on war deaths</a>.</p>
<p>For the study of lethal violence in non-state societies we have generally two different sources of information; for the more recent past (since the late 19th century) abundant ethnographic evidence is available. For the more distant past, we have information on the prevalence of violence from archeologists who have studied violence in past societies by studying archeological sites and skeletal remains. They present data on the share of people that died in violent conflict with other humans in scientific studies. Data from both archaeological and ethnographic studies is presented in the dataset on this website, but it is not all the information we have on violence in different societies. Non-quantitative information on violence is abundant; for example through forms of art.</p>
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<p>I have collected data on violent deaths; the long list of sources can be found below. These data show that in prehistoric times (archeological evidence) and in non-state societies (ethnographic evidence) the <strong>levels of violence was much higher than in modern state societies and in the world today</strong>.</p>

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Unit of Measurement: Rates vs Shares</h3>
<p>There are two ways to state the frequency of homicides in populations: rates and shares. For modern societies, homicide rates are usually given as homicides per 100,000 people per year; for more violent societies described by archeologists and ethnologists, homicide rates are sometimes presented in homicides per 1000 people per year. Homicide shares are simply the percentage of a sample of deaths that¬†were due to homicide.</p>
<h3>Distinguishing between War and Murders</h3>
<p>The word 'war' evokes the image of large scale battles; indeed the modern literature considers an armed conflict to be a war 'if at least 1,000 battle or battle-related deaths are inflicted in the indicated year'.[ref]Mueller (2009) - War Has Almost Ceased to Exist: An Assessment. In Political Science Quarterly, 124, 2, 297--321.[/ref] It is important to make clear that the aforementioned association of the word and the modern definition are not applicable to lethal conflicts among small societies. What is common to both the definition of warfare among small and large societies is that the conflict is fought between different groups of people. One drawback of my database is that it was not always possible to distinguish between violence killings inflicted by members of the same groups and killings inflicted by members of a different groups. In small societies without a state authority, the violence between different groups is typically higher than among members of the same group. The reason why this distinction is hard to make is obvious for archeological evidence. For data based on ethnographic studies, I commented on the distinction between inter- and intra-group killings. Nevertheless, this dataset would be improved if the distinction would always be made.<br />
To make comparisons between levels of violence, I calculated the homicide shares and rates for modern state-societies by also including killings in both intra-group wars and inter-group homicides.</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>This is the collection of all my sources for data on ethnographic and archaeological evidence on violent deaths.</p>
<p>This data is presented in the entry on homicides.</p>
<p><strong>My sources and procedure to collect this data</strong></p>
<p>The starting point for my research was the sample presented by Pinker (2011).[ref]Pinker (2011) - The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. [/ref] Pinker does not present the numerical data itself but instead includes two bar charts (Figures 2-2 and 2-3) from which the exact data cannot be discerned. Therefore I looked up all the sources for the data he presents.<br />
The topic of Pinker's book is the decline of violence in humanity's history. That would give him an incentive to cherry-pick data that suits his narrative. For this reason I had contact with several of his critics and asked them for their evidence. After this assessment¬†of Pinker's data, I did not find any reason to assume that he cherry-picked. He included all the data that his sources included.<br />
Through my contact with critics of Pinker's book I was referred to a critique of Pinker's data by Douglas Fry.[ref]Fry (2013) - Chapter 1: War, Peace, and Human Nature. The Challenge of Scientific Objectivity. In War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views. Edited by Douglas Fry. Oxford University Press. New York.[/ref] Fry criticizes some of Pinker's data. I checked the original sources for the criticized information, referred to the criticisms and the original sources in my comments and corrected the data when the criticism was justified.<br />
An additional source that I added to my dataset and which was not yet available to Pinker is a study published by Robert Walker and Drew Bailey (published in 2013).[ref]Walker and Bailey (2013) - Body counts in lowland South American violence. In Evolution and Human Behavior, 34, 1, 29--34.[/ref]</p>

The definitive chronicle of history‚Äôs 100 worst atrocities. New York: Norton.[/ref] estimates a total number of deaths of all violent deaths in the 20th-century of 180 million deaths. Pinker assumes an average annual world population for the 20th century of 3 billion. (see his footnote 65 in chapter 2).<br />
180.000.000 / 100 = 1.800.000 violent deaths per year. Divided by an annual population of 3.000.000.000 and multiplied by 100,000 is 60.</li>

<p><strong>Society:</strong> US, 20th century (war deaths) <strong>Violent deaths per 100,000 people per year:</strong> 3.79</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Own calculation:</em> I am following Pinker calculating this data: From the US Census I know that the average population of the US over the 20th century was: 163,275,000 (The source for this data is <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/hist_stats.html">U.S. Census</a>.<br />
The number of 'Total Deaths of U.S. Military Personnel Serving and Casualties' for the 20th century: 619,538 This is taken from Leland &amp; Oboroceanu (2010)[ref]Leland, A., &amp; Oboroceanu, M.-J. 2010. American war and military operations casualties: Lists and statistics. <a href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/139347.pdf">Available online</a>[/ref].<br />
According to this source these are the number of 'Total Deaths of U.S. Military Personnel Serving and Casualties':<br />
Spanish-American War (1898-1901): 2,446<br />
World War I (1917-1918): 116,516<br />
World War II (1941-1946): 405,399<br />
Korean War (1950-1953): 36,574<br />
Vietnam Conflict (1964-1973): 58,220<br />
Persian Gulf War (1990-1991): 383<br />
The sum of total deaths is: 619.538.<br />
That means in an average year of the 20th 6195.38 US citizens died in war. Therefore the number of war deaths per 100,000 of the US in the 20th century is 3.79 (including the deaths of US-Americans in the Spanish-American War in the 2 last years of the 19th century.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Society</strong> World, 2007 (battle and one-sided violence deaths) <strong>Violent deaths per 100,000 people per year:</strong> 0.33</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Own calculation:</em> I am following Pinker calculating this data: The Human Security Report Project. (accessed April 2013). Miniatlas of human security. (World Bank) has data on the global number of war deaths and is <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/Deaths-from-Organized-Violence.aspx">available online</a>.<br />
The last year that this source has data for is 2007. These are the numbers by category:<br />
Number of State-Based Battle Deaths: 16.773<br />
Number of Non-State Battle Deaths: 1.865<br />
Number of One Sided Violence Deaths: 3.501<br />
The total sum of the above is: 22.139. The population of the earth in 2007 war 6.658.000.000 (World Bank). This means taking the whole planet together 0.33 of 100,000 people died in battles and one-sided violence.</li>

<p><strong>Society:</strong> (Hunter-Gatherer) Casiguran Agta (Philippines) <strong>Share of Violent Deaths:</strong> <em>12%</em> were attributed to homicide (In the less violent time period (1962-1977); adult male population). Between 1977 and 1984 the homicide rate is 326 homicides per 100,000 people per year. In this time period, that was described as unusually violent (and which is therefore not quoted in my statistic) 21% of all adult male deaths were due to homicide (see comment).</p>

(1989) - Population decline in a Philippine Negrito hunter-gatherer Society. American Journal of Human Biology, 1, 59‚Äì72.</a></li>
<li><em>Comment:</em> The source of Pinker on the percentage of deaths in warfare is Bowles (2009) and he made a mistake that Fry (2013) corrects: Bowles (2009) based his calculation on ten killings when in fact 9 killings are reported. In the time between 1936 and 1950 not 10 but 9 Casiguran Agta were killed - 1 in 1950, 5 in 1947; 1 in1938 raid and 2 ‚Äúshortly after World War II‚Äù. Bowles therefore miscalculated his data and Pinker carries this wrong number over.<br />
As Headlands study of the Agta focusses on a later time (1962-84) I take the data from this better researched time. As Headland states that the latter half of his research stay (post-1977) was a time of 'unusual high violence' I quote the death rate due to violence from the earlier time (1962-77). In this more 'peaceful' time the share of violent deaths was 12% (and this also is not counting the number of killings of non-Agta by Agta - which is also high (see below)).<br />
Homicides, as opposed to deaths in warfare are very common in the Agta Population as Headland points out: 'In the sample of adult male deaths before 1977, 12% were attributed to homicide; in 1977-1984, 21% of all adult male deaths were from homicide. The overall homicide rate for the Casiguran Agta, based on the data for 1977-1984, is 326 homicides per 100,000 people per year. The 14 homicides on which this calculation is based include only homicides of members of the de jure population.' (page 68).<br />
He also notes that 'of the 33 Agta deaths by homicide since my arrival in 1962 up to June 1984, only eight were killed by non-Agta. Of the 14 Agta homicides in the de jure population in 1977-1984, only five were killed by non-Agta. Of the 53 homicides, only 30% of the victims were killed by non-Agta (16153)<br />
And he says: 'It should be noted here that Agta kill outsiders, too. I know of 24 cases of Agta killing non-Agta since 1930 and 15 cases since I began fieldwork in the area in 1962.' (page 69)</li>

<li><em>Comment:</em> The paper distinguishes clearly between deaths inflicted by Venezuelans on Hiwis and death inflicted by Hiwis on Hiwis. Table 4 (page 450) shows the statistics on both groups and makes an additional distinction between precontact and postcontact times. In the precontact times 153 deaths are tabulated. There were 11 killings of Hiwi by Hiwi in the precontact times. Out of the 160 killings in the postcontact times 6 were killings of Hiwi by Hiwi. The Source that my source quoted states: "The Hiwi mortality proÔ¨Åle is characterized by notably high rates of violence and accidental trauma" (page 449)<br />
The numbers I quoted and the share of violent deaths is not counting infanticides that were very common among the Hiwi (and are reported by Hill, Hurtado (2007)).</li>

Gat (2006) refers to Pilling saying: 'Pilling‚Äôs estimate of at least 10 per cent killed among the Tiwi men in one decade.'<br />
Gat (2006) refers to Kimber saying: 'Kimber‚Äôs estimate, for a generation, of 5 per cent mortality in Ô¨Åghting in arid areas and about 6.5 per cent in well-watered ones refers to violent mortality in relation to the entire population‚Äôs overall mortality rates.' Pinker quotes the 10%, which according to Gat (2006) only refers to the male population. I decided to quote the average of the two shares specified for the entire population. That is 5.75%.</li>

<ul>
<li>My own calculation:* The Human Security Report Project - Miniatlas of human security (accessed April 2013) has data on the global number of war deaths. It is <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/Deaths-from-Organized-Violence.aspx">available online</a><br />
The last year that we have data for is 2007. These are the numbers by category:<br />
Number of State-Based Battle Deaths: 16773<br />
Number of Non-State Battle Deaths: 1865<br />
Number of One Sided Violence Deaths: 3501<br />
The total sum of the above is: 22139 deaths<br />
The world population in 2007 was 6.658.000.000 (World Bank) - The death rate of the world is approximately 8 per 1000 per year according to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html">CIA Factbook</a>. This means in 2007 around 53264000 people died in 2007. Therefore the ratio of people dying due to warfare in 2007 is 22139/53264000. This means 0.04% of the global deaths were due to warfare in 2007.</li>

<li><em>My source for the data:</em> Keeley (1996)</li>
<li><em>Comment and Source that my source quoted:</em> Keeley (1996) writes: 'Contrary to Brian Ferguson's claim that such slaughters were a consequence of contact with modem European or other civilizations, archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography.(Footnote 23- 23. (Middle Missouri) Zimmerman 1980; Wilky 1990; Bamforth 1994; (Southwest) Haas 1990: 187, and personal communication.) For example, at Crow Creek in South Dakota, archaeologists found a mass grave containing the remains of more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilaced during an attack on their village a century and a hdf before Columbus's arrival (ca. A.D. 1325). The attack seems to have occurred just when the village's fortifications were being rebuilt. AU the houses were burned, and most of the inhabitants were murdered. This death toll represented more than 60 percent of the village's population, estimated from the number of houses to have been about 800. The survivors appear to have been primarily young women, as their skeletons are underrepresented among the bones; if so, they were probably taken away as captives. Certainly, the site was deserted for some time after the attack because the bodies evidently remained exposed to scavenging animals for a few weeks before burial. In other words, this whole village was annihilared in a single attack and never reoccupied.'</li>

<h3>Rebirth of Forests</h3>
<p>For millennia wherever humans settled they depleted forrests. This is not the case anymore in some countries of the world. Higher yields and other factors¬†made it possible to preserve forests and in some countries to increase the forest area. Sustainability was reached in these places.</p>

<h3>Genocides in the 20th Century</h3>

The number of, and deaths resulting from, genocides taking place around the world has been on a downward trend since the end of the Second World War. The Holocaust is perhaps the darkest chapter in human history. The scale, organisation and nature of the killing was unprecedented and there has been a concerted effort ever since to prevent a similar tragedy. The first session of the United Nations General Assembly  affirmed the crime of genocide describing it as "a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual human beings." [ref]<a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/1/ares1.htm" target="_blank">United Nations Resolution 96 (I). "The Crime of Genocide." 11 December 1946.</a>[/ref]

<h3>Historical Genocides</h3>

Although the word genocide was only created in the 20th century, there exist many historical examples of genocide. One of the earliest examples identified is the destruction of Melos in 416 BCE by the Athenian army. The Athenians laid siege to the small island of Melos until the Melian government surrendered, at which point the Athenians proceeded to kill all the adult men and enslaved the women and children. A useful reference for genocide in the ancient world can be found <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/article/485/" target="_blank">here</a>.


<h2> Correlates, Determinants & Consequences </h2>

<h3>Causes: Mainstream Theories</h3>

The mainstream theories of the causes of can be broadly summarised as:

<ol>
<li> <strong>Fractionalisation, grievance and dehumanisation</strong>: This group of theories collectively argue that genocide can be predicted by higher ethnolinguistic or religious fractionalisation within a country combined with grievances between groups. The final important dimension is dehumanisation of the victim group. This theory is associated with the sociologist Leo Kuper, who conducted some of the earliest studies in comparative genocide.[ref]Kuper, Leo. <em>Genocide: Its political use in the twentieth century</em>. Yale University Press, 1982.[/ref] </li> 
<li> <strong>National crises</strong>: Here, catastrophic events such as war, economic depression or revolution are the triggers for genocide or other types of mass killing. This causality is motivated by one of two theories, the scapegoat thoery and the political opportunity thoery. The first theory posits that a particular group is identified as the cause of the crisis and that the solution is to eliminate the group. The second theory instead argues that the crisis creates the opporunity for a group to consolidate their power.</li>
<li> <strong>Government power</strong>: This theory is largely due to Rudolph Rummel and is referred to as the power principle. Rummel argues that "The more power a government has, the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the elite, and the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and domestic subjects. The more constrained the power of governments, the less it will aggress on others."[ref]Rummel, Rudolph J. <em>Death by government</em>. Transaction Publishers, 1997.[/ref] A major implication of this theory is that authoritarian regimes are far more likely to resort to democide than democratic regimes.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Data Quality & Definitions</h2>

<h3>Data Quality</h3>

One major obstacle in quantifying atrocities of this nature is that many perpetrators work hard to conceal the true number of victims or simply do not keep count. For this reason the estimated death tolls are imprecise with large confidence intervals. Scholars still debate the number of victims of The Holocaust, the largest and most well documented case of genocide in human history.

<h3>Definition of Genocide: United Nations</h3>

The United Nations uses the following definition to classify acts of genocide:[ref]
<a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide (OSAPG): Analysis Framework</a>[/ref]

<blockquote>any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</blockquote>



<h3>Definitions: Rudolph Rummel</h3>

Rudolph Rummel was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii and wrote many seminal works on war and violence. Rummel was the first to distinguish between different forms of state violence and invented the term democide. His definitions are listed below:[ref]<a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.CHAP2.HTM" target="_blank">R.J. Rummel. Chapter 2: Definition of Democide. <em>Death by Government</em>.</a>[/ref]
<ol>
	<li><strong>Genocide</strong>: among other things, the killing of people by a government because of their indelible group membership (race, ethnicity, religion, language).</li>
	<li><strong>Politicide</strong>: the murder of any person or people by a government because of their politics or for political purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Mass Murder</strong>: the indiscriminate killing of any person or people by a government.</li>
	<li><strong>Democide</strong>: The murder of any person or people by a government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder.</li>
</ol>

It is important to recognise that these definitions are not the same as those used by the Political Instability Task Force (PITF). In the PITF dataset a dominant entity other than the government may carry out politicide and a distinction is made between state terror and politicide.

<h3>Definition of Genocide and Politicide: PITF</h3>

The dataset used for data visualisations in this section is the Political Instability Task Force (PITF). A distinction is made between acts of genocide and politicide, the first being motivated by ethnic or religious difference, while the second is motivated by political opposition to the dominant power. Another important distinction is made between genocide/politicide and state repression or terror.



<blockquote>In genocides the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal (ethnolinguistic, religious) characteristics. In politicides, by contrast, groups are defined primarily in terms of their political opposition to the regime and dominant groups.

Genocide and politicide are distinguished from state repression and terror. In cases of state terror authorities arrest, persecute or execute a few members of a group in ways designed to terrorize the majority of the group into passivity or acquiescence. In the case of genocide and politicide authorities physically exterminate enough (not necessarily all) members of a target group so that it can no longer pose any conceivable threat to their rule or interests.</blockquote>

Education is widely accepted to be a fundamental resource, both for individuals and societies. Indeed, in most countries basic education is nowadays perceived not only as a right, but also as a duty ‚Äì governments are typically expected to ensure access to basic education, while citizens are often required by law to attain education up to a certain basic level.[ref] See the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education">compulsory education</a> for a table of the ages of compulsory schooling around the world.[/ref]

In this entry we begin by providing an overview of long run changes in education <em>outcomes and outputs</em> across the world, focusing both on quantity and quality measures of education attainment; and then provide an analysis of available evidence on the <em>determinants and consequences</em> of education.

From a historical perspective, the world went through a great expansion in education over the past two centuries. This can be seen across all quantity measures. Global literacy rates have been climbing over the course of the last two centuries, mainly though increasing rates of enrollment in primary education. Secondary and tertiary education have also seen drastic growth, with global average years of schooling being much higher now than a hundred years ago. Despite all these worldwide improvements, some countries have been lagging behind, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, where there are still countries that have literacy rates below 50% among the youth.

Data on the production of education shows that schooling tends to be largely financed with public resources across the globe, although a great deal of heterogeneity is observed between countries and world regions. Since differences in national expenditure on education do not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes, the data suggests that generic policies that increase expenditure on standard inputs, such as the number of teachers, are unlikely to be effective to improve education outcomes.

Regarding the consequences of education, a growing body of empirical research suggests that better education yields higher individual income and contributes towards the construction of social capital and long-term economic growth.

<h2>The Evolution of Education Outcomes</h2>
<!---------------------Long Run--------------------->
<h3>Literacy</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
Literacy is a key skill and a key measure of a population‚Äôs education. UNESCO operationalizes the measurement of literacy as the ability to both read and write a short, simple statement about one's own life. Literacy rates are determined by literacy questions in a census or sample survey of a population, in standardized tests of literacy, or via extrapolation from statistics about school enrollment and educational attainment[ref]UNESCO 'Recommendation Concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics',¬†<a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114584e.pdf">Records of the General Conference, tenth session, Paris, 1958: Resolutions</a>[/ref].

Statistics of literacy rates for recent decades are published by statistical offices. For earlier periods, historians have to reconstruct data from other sources. The most common method is to calculate the share of those people who could sign official documents (e.g. court documents).

<em><strong>Our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy">Literacy</a> contains further in-depth information on the topic.</strong> </em>
<h4>How has global literacy evolved in the last two centuries?</h4>
While the earliest forms of written communication date back to about 3,500-3,000 BCE, literacy remained for centuries a very restricted technology closely associated with the exercise of power. It was only until the Middle Ages that book production started growing and literacy among the general population slowly started becoming important in the Western World.[ref]An overview of the academic literature on the historical origins and spread of literacy can be found in Easton, P. (2014). Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Paris, France. Available online from <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org">http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002252/225258e.pdf</a>[/ref] In fact, while the ambition of universal literacy in Europe was a fundamental reform born from the Enlightment, it took centuries for it to happen. Even in early-industrialized countries it was only in the 19th and 20th centuries that rates of literacy approached universality.

The following visualization presents estimates of world literacy for the period 1800-2014. As we can see, literacy rates grew constantly but rather slowly until the beginning of the twentieth century. And the rate of growth really climbed after the middle of the 20th century, when the expansion of basic education became a global priority. You can read more about the expansion of education systems around the world in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#historical-perspective">Financing Education</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literate-and-illiterate-world-population?stackMode=relative" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>How is literacy distributed across the globe?</h4>
The following interactive map shows literacy rates around the world, using recent estimates published in the CIA Factbook. As it can be seen, all countries outside Africa (with the exception of Afghanistan) have literacy rates above 50%.

Despite progress in the long run, however, large inequalities remain, notably between sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. In Burkina Faso, Niger and South Sudan ‚Äì the African countries at the bottom of the rank ‚Äì literacy rates are still below 30%.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literacy-rate-by-country" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>How fast are we closing cross-country inequalities in literacy?</h4>
The preceding visualization shows that, despite the fact that literacy is today higher than ever, there are still important challenges in many developing countries. However, data on literacy rates by age groups shows that in most countries, and certainly in virtually all developing countries, there are large generational gaps: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/#the-global-expansion-of-literacy-has-helped-reduce-inequalities-both-within-and-across-countries"> younger generations are progressively better educated than older generations</a>. This indicates that in these countries the literacy rate for the overall population will continue to increase.

The following visualization shows the estimates and projections of the share of individuals, across countries, who have no education. These figures, from The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), suggest that we should see rates of education increasing as the world develops ‚Äì and by 2050, only five countries are likely to have a rate of no education above 20%: these are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali and Niger.

While these projections entail a number of assumptions, the conclusion seems to be that by 2050 we can hope most of the cross-country gaps in literacy to be closed.

<!----------------------------------------->
<h3>School enrollment and attendance</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
School enrollment and attendance are two important measures of educational attainment. Here we focus on enrollment and attendance rates specifically at the primary level.

The rate of primary school enrollment is typically measured through administrative data, and is defined as the number of children enrolled in primary school who belong to the age group that officially corresponds to primary schooling, divided by the total population of the same age group.

The rate of attendance, on the other hand, is typically measured through household survey data, and is defined as the percentage of children in the age group that officially corresponds to primary schooling who are reported as attending primary school.
<h4>Primary school enrollment around the world increased drastically in the last century</h4>
The following visualization shows estimates of primary education enrollment rates for a selection of 111 countries during the period 1870-2010. You can add countries, or switch to the 'map' view, by selecting the corresponding options at the top of the chart.

The plotted series for the UK typifies the experience of early-industrialized countries, where enrollment in primary education grew rapidly with the spread of compulsory primary schooling in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

And the case of Colombia is representative of the pattern observed across many developing countries, where primary education enrollment rates grew particularly fast in the second half of the 20th century.

The growth in access to primary education across developing countries was achieved through an important increase in government expenditure on education in these countries (you can read more about this in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#when-did-the-expansion-of-basic-education-become-a-global-phenomenon">discussion of global expansion in education expenditure</a>).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/primary-enrollment-selected-countries" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>Mean years of schooling are increasing</h3>
Across the globe, measures of education have been increasing. This rise has been caused by a combination of increased appreciation of the benefits of education to the individual and society and increased government provision.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-schooling" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Primary school attendance remains a challenge in many developing countries</h4>
The previous visualization showed the important progress that countries around the world have made regarding access to education, as measured by enrollment rates. Here we focus on evidence of access to education, as measured by school <em>attendance</em>. The difference lies in the source of information regarding participation: enrollment figures come from official records, while attendance estimates comes from asking households directly.

In the majority of developing countries, net enrollment rates are higher than attendance rates. This reflects the fact that many children who are officially enrolled, do not regularly attend school. The following visualization, from the UNESCO report <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/oosc05-en.pdf">Measuring Exclusion From Primary Education (2005)</a>, shows the relationship between these two measures. The source reports that "among the 59 countries with comparable data, in 24 countries participation rates drop by five percentage points for the primary school-age group when household surveys are used instead of administrative data."[ref]UNESCO points out that "concerns have been also raised that enrolment rates can be overstated in education systems in order to meet goals or due to direct links to levels of financing and resources."[/ref]
<h6>Children in school: administrative data compared to household survey data, primary school ages ‚Äì Figures A1 and A2 in UNESCO (2005)[ref]Source: UNESCO report <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/oosc05-en.pdf">Measuring Exclusion From Primary Education (2005)</a>[/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EnrollmentVsAttendance-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8571" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EnrollmentVsAttendance-1.png" alt="UNESCO_EnrollmentVsAttendance" width="600" height="525" /></a>

The following interactive map shows recent primary school attendance estimates for a selection of (mainly) low and middle income countries. The map is zoomed-in around Africa, because in these countries the gaps between attendance and enrollment are largest ‚Äì other world regions can be displayed in the map by clicking on the drop-down menu on the top-left.

As we can see, low attendance rates are an important problem in sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äì more so than enrollment figures suggest. In Niger, Chad and Liberia, estimates suggest that less than half of the school-aged children attend primary school.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/primary-school-attendance-selected-countries?region=Africa" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<!------------------------------------------>
<h3>Years of schooling</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
The average number of years spent in school are another common measure of a population's education level. It is a helpful measure, because it allows aggregation of attainment across education levels. This allows an analysis of the 'stock of human capital' that a population has at any given point in time.

Average, or mean years of schooling of a population, are typically calculated from data on (i) the distribution of the population by age group and highest level of education attained in a given year; and (ii) the official duration of each level of education.
<h4>The world is more educated than ever before</h4>
In the previous section we showed, through school enrollment data, that the world went through a great expansion in education over the past two centuries. Here we show evidence of this process of education expansion using cross-country estimates of average years of schooling.

The following interactive visualization shows trends in years of schooling for a selection of 111 countries during the period 1870-2010. As usual, you can add countries, or switch to the 'map' view, by selecting the corresponding options at the top of the chart. As we can see, the average number of years spent in school has gone up around the world. And once again, we see the pattern that has already been discussed: early-industrialized countries pioneered the expansion of education in the 19th century, but this process became a global phenomenon after the second World War.

The experience of some countries, such as South Korea, shows how remarkably quickly educational attainment can increase.

<h4>How has the stock of human capital evolved in the long run?</h4>
In the previous interactive visualisation we showed how the average number of years spent in school has been going up constantly across the world. Here we go further and explore changes across the entire global <em>distribution</em> of years of schooling.

The following graph, from Lee and Lee (2016)[ref]Lee, J. W., &amp; Lee, H. (2016). Human capital in the long run. Journal of Development Economics.[/ref], plots the distribution of the number of years of schooling across the entire adult population, for selected years. Roughly speaking, you can think of this graph as a 'smooth histogram': if all people in the world were ranked by years of education, this chart would approximately tell us, for any number of years in the horizontal axis, the proportion of the world population that achieved those years.[ref]Strictly speaking, the y-axis measures the density of the distribution of years ‚Äì in other words, it shows the relative likelihood that the variable 'years of schooling' takes on a given value.[/ref]

We can see that in 1870, the distribution was concentrated at the left: most of the people had between 0 and 3 years of education. In contrast, by 2010 the distribution had shifted drastically to the right.

We can see that there has been a continuous rightward shift in the successive distributions of schooling across time. This reflects the fact that there has been a continuous increase in average years of schooling worldwide: as the share of the uneducated population fell over time, the concentration at the lower level became less pronounced.

The increasingly long tails that we see in the distributions, are the result of cross-country inequalities in education expansion ‚Äì in the long run, we can see that there has been a considerable increase in the <em>dispersion</em> of the years of schooling. This is mainly the result of cross-country differences, since some nations started expanding education much later than other, and some are still lagging behind. Interestingly, however, inequality grew in the period 1870-1950, but after this point, it has slowly started going down (notice that the distribution in 2010 is 'bulkier' in the middle, vis-a-vis the distribution in 1950). Below we provide more detailed evidence of how education inequality has been going down since 1950.

<h4>What has been the evolution of gender inequalities in education?</h4>
The following visualization shows the evolution of female-to-male ratios of educational attainment (mean years of schooling) across different world regions.

The estimates in the visualization below correspond to regional averages of total year of schooling for females (15-64 years of age), divided by the corresponding regional averages for males (15-64 years of age). Regional averages are population-weighted.

As we can see, despite short periods of decline, there is generally an upward trend in the gender ratios across all regions ‚Äì this implies that gender gaps in educational attainment have been going down in the long run. In fact, Latin America and Eastern Europe caught up with the group of 'advanced economies'[ref]For regional estimates, the authors classify the following countries as 'Advanced Economies': Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, USA, United Kingdom. Further details on regional classifications are available in the source paper.[/ref] in the 1980s, and the gender gaps in these regions have already been closed almost completely (i.e. the gender ratios approximate the 100% benchmark for education gender parity).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-ratios-for-mean-years-of-schooling" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>How has education inequality changed in the last couple of decades?</h4>
The following visualization shows the recent evolution of inequality in educational attainment, through a series of graphs plotting changes in the Gini coefficient of the distribution of years of schooling across different world regions. The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality and higher values indicate higher inequality ‚Äì you can read about the definition and estimation of Gini coefficients in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">income inequality</a>. The time-series chart below shows inequality by age group. It can be seen that as inequality is falling over time, the level of inequality is higher for older generations than it is for younger generations. We can also see that in the period 1960-2010, education inequality went down every year, for all age groups and in all world regions.

Have gains from historical education expansion fully materialized? The breakdown by age gives us a view into the future: as the inequality is lower among today's younger generations, we can expect the decline of inequality to continue in the future. Thus, further reductions in education inequality are still to be expected within developing countries; and if the expansion of global education can be continued, we can speed up this important process of global convergence.

<h3>Attainment by level</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
The highest level of education that individuals complete is another common measure of educational attainment. This measure is used as an input to calculating years of schooling, and allows clear comparisons across levels of education.

The estimates discussed in this section come from The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). These include both historic estimates and projections. You can read more about this source of data, including details on the estimation methodology, in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">Projections of Future Education</a>.
<h4>Education at higher levels, mainly secondary and tertiary, is becoming increasingly important around the world</h4>
The following interactive visualization shows, country by country, a breakdown of the population by highest level of education achieved for those aged 15+. If you want to see the estimates for a different country, just click ‚ÄòChange Country‚Äô at the top left of the chart, below the colored labels. If you want to see figures in relative terms (i.e. shares of population by level), you can click the option labeled 'Relative'.

You can see that education at higher levels, mainly secondary and tertiary, is becoming increasingly important around the world, as the number of people without education goes down. The projections show how these trends are expected to evolve in the future, depending on population growth dynamics in each country.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-breakdown-by-highest-level-of-education-achieved-for-those-aged-15-in-1970-2050?country=BRA" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

A global picture of attainment by level emphasizes the conclusion above. The following visualization shows estimates and projections of the total world population by level of education. It shows that our world will be inhabited by more and more educated people: while in 1970 there were only around 700 million people in the world with secondary or post-secondary education, by 2100 this figure is predicted to be 10 times larger.

<!-------------------------------------->
<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
Throughout this entry we have discussed 'quantity' measures of educational attainment. Now we turn to 'quality' measures of education. The most widely used measure for cross-country comparisons of education quality is the OECD‚Äôs <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/home/" target="_blank">Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)</a>, which currently covers all OECD member countries, plus more than 30 partner countries.

The PISA study assess the performance of 15 year old school pupils‚Äô performance on mathematics, reading and science examinations. The tests are designed to be comparable across countries and to assess students‚Äô knowledge as well as problem solving skills. The first round of tests took place in 2000 and is repeated every three years.
<h4>How does education across countries compare in terms of learning outcomes?</h4>
The map below plots available PISA estimates from across the globe. The reported figures correspond to averages across mathematics, reading and science examinations. As we can see, there is substantial cross-country heterogeneity.

This map shows that East Asian countries achieve particularly high test scores. These results are broadly supported by similar research conducted by the <a href="http://www.iea.nl" target="_blank">International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA)</a> and Boston College. The IEA produces assessments of mathematics and science performance (TIMSS) as well as of reading and literacy (PIRLS). The countries that consistently make up the top 5 in mathematics and the sciences are Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.

Of course, these cross-country differences do not necessarily imply differences in teaching quality, as there are many factors ‚Äì including cultural aspects ‚Äì that contribute to determine learning outcomes. In the next section we explore available evidence regarding the determinants of education outcomes.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oecd-pisa-test-scores-for-selected-countries-2000-2012" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h2>The Production of Education</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
The most common way to gauge differences in the way countries 'produce' education, is to analyze data on expenditure.

In this section we begin by providing an overview of education expenditure around the world, and then turn to the question of how expenditure contributes to the production of education.

The main source of data on international education expenditure is UNESCO's Institute for Statistics <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Pages/default.aspx">(UIS)</a>. The¬†same data is also then published by the World Bank (<a href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/education/">World Bank EdStats</a> and <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>) and <a href="https://www.gapminder.org">Gapminder</a>. It is also the main source of education data for most UN reports ‚Äì such as the EFA Global Monitoring Report (UNESCO), the Human Development Report (UNDP), the State of the World‚Äôs Children report (UNICEF) and the Millennium Development Goals (UN).

<em><strong>Further in-depth information on this topic, including definitions, data sources, historical trends and much more, can be found in our dedicated entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education">Financing Education</a>.</strong> </em>
<h3>Cross-country spending patters</h3>
<h4>When did the provision of education first become a public policy priority?</h4>
Governments around the world are nowadays widely perceived to be responsible for ensuring the provision of accessible quality education. The advancement of the idea to provide education for more and more children only began in the mid 19th century, when most of today‚Äôs industrialized countries started expanding primary education.

The following visualization, plotting public expenditure on education as a share of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">Gross Domestic Product </a>(GDP) for a number of early-industrialized countries, shows that this expansion took place mainly through public funding.[ref]The source for the visualization below ‚Äì Tanzi &amp; Schuktnecht (2000) ‚Äì compiles estimates from many sources, including: League of Nations Statistical Yearbook (various years), Mitchell (1962), OECD Education at a Glance (1996), UNESCO World Education Report (1993), UNDP Human Development Report (1996), UN World Economics Survey (various years). To the extent that the authors do not specify which sources were prioritised for each year/country, it is not possible for us to reliably extend the time series with newer data. For instance, the OECD Education at a Glance report (1998), which presents estimates for the years 1990 and 1995, suggests discrepancies with the values reported by Tanzi &amp; Schuktnecht (2000) for 1993.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-education-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Primary education continues to be publicly funded in industrialized countries</h4>
Those countries that pioneered the expansion of primary education in the 19th century ‚Äì all of which are current OECD member states ‚Äì relied heavily on public funding to do so. Today, public resources still dominate funding for the primary, secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education levels in these countries.

While in the last decade the share of public funding for these levels of education has decreased slightly, the broad pattern is remarkably stable. The visualization below presents OECD-average expenditure on education institutions by source of funds.[ref]The OECD provides country-specific figures. However, there is relatively little variation across OECD countries in this respect. This is explained by near-universal enrolment rates at these levels of education and the demographic structure of the population.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-oecd-education-expenditure-by-source-of-funding-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>The world is expanding funding for education today</h4>
The last two decades have seen a small but general increase in the share of income that countries devote to education. The following chart plots trends in public expenditure on education as a share of GDP. As usual, a selection of countries is shown by default, but other countries can be added by clicking on the relevant option at the top of the chart. Although the data is highly irregular due to missing observations for many countries, we can still observe a broad upward trend for the majority of countries. Specifically, it can be checked that of the 88 countries with available data for 2000/2010, three-fourths increased education spending as a share of GDP within this decade. As incomes ‚Äì measured by GDP per capita ‚Äì are generally increasing around the world, this means that the total amount of global resources spent on education is also increasing in absolute terms.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-government-expenditure-on-education-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>In high-income countries households shoulder a larger share of education expenditures at higher education levels than at lower levels ‚Äì but in low-income countries this is not the case</h4>
The following visualization shows the percentage of total education expenditures contributed directly by households in 15 high income countries and 15 low/middle income countries (most recent data available on 2014).

The top chart in this figure, corresponding to high income countries, shows a very clear pattern: households contribute the largest share of expenses in tertiary education, and the smallest share in primary education. Roughly speaking, this pattern tends to be progressive, since students from wealthier households are more likely to attend tertiary education, and those individuals who attend tertiary education are likely to perceive large private benefits.[ref]Strictly speaking, for this spending pattern to be truly progressive there must be subsidies or income-contingent loans to guarantee that low-income students can also access tertiary education and reap the private benefits from this type of investment.[/ref] In contrast, the bottom chart shows a very different picture: in several low-income countries households contribute proportionally more to primary education than to higher levels. Malawi is a notable case in point ‚Äì tertiary education is almost completely subsidised by the state, yet household contribute with almost 20% of the costs in primary education. Such distribution of private household contributions to education is regressive.

<h3>The link between expenditure and outcomes</h3>
<h4>Do countries that spend more public resources on education tend to have better education outcomes?</h4>
The following visualization presents three scatter plots using 2010 data to show the cross-country correlation between (i) education expenditure (as a share of GDP), (ii) mean years of schooling, and (iii) mean PISA test scores. At a cross-sectional level, expenditure on education correlates positively with both quantity and quality measures; and not surprisingly, the quality and quantity measures also correlate positively with each-other. But correlation does not imply causation: there are many factors that simultaneously affect education spending and outcomes. Indeed, these scatterplots show that despite the broad positive correlation, there is substantial dispersion away from the trend line ‚Äì in other words, there is substantial variation in outcomes that does not seem to be captured by differences in expenditure.
<h6>Correlation between education outcomes and education expenditure (2010 data)[ref]Data on expenditure corresponds to 2010 total government education expenditure across all levels, as a share of GDP (source: World Bank Education Statistics). Data on PISA scores corresponds to 2010 mean average test scores across categories ‚Äì mathematics, reading and science (source: OECD PISA). Data on years of schooling corresponds to 2010 mean years of schooling for the population aged 15 and over (source: Barro Lee Education dataset)[/ref]</h6>

<h4>Does cross-country variation in government education expenditure explain cross-country differences in education outcomes?</h4>
The following visualization presents the relationship between PISA reading outcomes and average education spending per student, splitting the sample of countries by income levels. It shows that income is an important factor that affects both expenditure on education and education outcomes: we can see that above a certain national income level, the relationship between PISA scores and education expenditure per pupil becomes virtually inexistent. Several studies with more sophisticated econometric models corroborate the fact that expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes.[ref]For a discussion of evidence supporting this claim, see Hanushek, E. A., (2006). School Resources. Handbook of the Economics of Education, 2.[/ref] You can read more about test scores and learning outcomes in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education-drop-out-rates/">Quality of Education</a>.

<h4>What inputs enter the 'education production function'?</h4>
The fact that expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes is indicative of the intricate nature of the process through which such outcomes are produced. The following ‚Äòproduction function‚Äô provides a conceptual framework to think about the determinants of learning outcomes:[ref]P. Glewwe, K. Muralidharan (2016). <em>Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications</em>. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 5.[/ref]

[latex]$$A=a(s,\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{C},\mathbf{H},\mathbf{I})$$[/latex]
where <em>A</em> is skills learned (achievement), <em>s</em> is years of schooling, <strong>Q</strong> is a vector of school and teacher characteristics (quality), <strong>C</strong> is a vector of child characteristics (including "innate ability"), <strong>H</strong> is a vector of household characteristics, and <strong>I</strong> is a vector of school inputs under the control of households, such as children‚Äôs daily attendance, effort in school and in doing homework, and purchases of school supplies.

This conceptualization highlights that, for any given level of expenditure, the output achieved will depend on the input mix. And consequently, this implies that in order to explain education outcomes, we must rely on information about specific inputs.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#school-inputs">Available evidence specifically on the importance of school inputs</a>, suggests that learning outcomes may be more sensitive to improvements in the quality of teachers, than to improvements in class sizes. And regarding <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#household-inputs">household inputs</a>, the recent experimental evidence suggests that interventions that increase the benefits of attending school (e.g. conditional cash transfers) are particularly likely to increase student time in school; and that those that incentivise academic effort (e.g. scholarships) are likely to improve learning outcomes.

Policy experiments have also shown that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#how-important-are-pre-school-investments">pre-school investment in demand-side inputs leads to large positive impacts on education</a> ‚Äì and other important outcomes later in life. The environment that children are exposed to early in life, plays a crucial role in shaping their abilities, behavior and talents.

<h2>The Consequences of Education</h2>
<!-------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Context</h3>
Education is a valuable investment, both individually and collectively. Here we analyse available evidence of the private (i.e. individual) and social (i.e. collective) returns to education.

The most common way to measure the private returns to education, is to study how attainment improves individual labor market outcomes ‚Äì usually by attempting to measure the effect of education on wages. Regarding social returns, the most common approach is to measure the effect of education on pro-social behaviour (e.g. volunteering, political participation, interpersonal trust) and economic growth.

Most of the evidence presented below is 'descriptive', in the sense that it points towards correlations between education and various individuals and social outcomes, without necessarily proving <em>causation</em>. In each case, we provide a discussion of the robustness of the evidence.
<h3>Private returns to education</h3>
<h4>How do earning correlate with education?</h4>
The OECD's report <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a> provides descriptive evidence of the link between individual education and income. The following chart shows the earnings of tertiary-educated workers, by level of tertiary education, relative to the earnings of workers with upper secondary education. As we can see, in all OECD countries for which information is available, the higher the level of education, the greater the relative earnings.

The countries in this chart are ordered in ascending order of relative earnings. As we can see, the countries with the greatest returns to tertiary education (Brazil, Chile and Colombia) are also those where tertiary education is less prevalent among the adult population. This is indicative of the demand-and-supply dynamics that contribute to determine wage differentials across different countries.

These figures are simply correlations, and cannot be interpreted causally: individuas with more education are different in many ways to individuals with less education, so we cannot attribute wage differences solely to education choices.
<h6>Relative earnings of tertiary-educated workers, by level of tertiary education, 2013 ‚Äì Figure A6.1 in <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">OECD Education at a Glance (2015)</a></h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8590 size-large" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/OECD_SkillPremium-750x319.png" alt="OECD_SkillPremium" width="750" height="319" /></a>
<h4>Is there a <em>causal</em> effect of education on earnings?</h4>
The previous graph gave a cross-country comparison of earning by education level. As pointed out, those figures were difficult to interpret causally, because they failed to account for important underlying differences in things like hours worked, experience profiles, etc.

The following visualization, from Card (1999)[ref]Card, D. (1999). The causal effect of education on earnings. Handbook of labor economics, 3, 1801-1863. [/ref], attempts to pin down the relationship between education and earnings, by comparing wages across education levels, genders and age groups. The data used for this figure comes from the March Current Population Surveys in the US. Education levels correspond to individuals with 10, 12 and 16 years of education. The marks show averages for each corresponding group, and the smooth lines show the predictions made by a simple econometric model explaining wages by education and experience.

The first conclusion from this charts is that for both genders, at any given age, individuals with more education perceive higher wages. Moreover, these estimates suggest that the incremental benefit from additional education grows with experience: the differences in wages between people with varying degrees of education become larger as they advance in their careers. In other words, education pay-offs are not constant over the life cycle. Other studies using different data have found similar results (see, for instance, Blundell et al. 2013[ref]Blundell, Richard, et al. Female labour supply, human capital and welfare reform. No. w19007. National Bureau of Economic Research, 2013.[/ref])

These estimates can still not be interpreted causally, because there are yet other potential sources of bias that are unaccounted for, such as innate ability. To address this issue, the economics literature has developed different strategies. For example, by contrasting the wages of genetically identical twins with different schooling level, researchers have found a way of controlling for unobservable characteristics such as family background and innate ability. The conclusion from these 'twin studies' is that the average estimates suggested by the figure below, are not very different to those that would be obtained from more sophisticated models that control for ability. In other words, there is robust evidence supporting the causal effect of education on wages (for more details see Card 1999).

<h3>Social returns to education</h3>
<h4>Education correlates with prosocial behavior</h4>
The following chart uses OECD results from the Survey of Adult Skills to show how self-reported trust in others correlates with educational attainment. More precisely, this chart plots the percentage-point difference in the likelihood of reporting to trust others, by education level of respondents. Those individuals with upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education are taken as the reference group, so the percentage point difference is expressed in relation to this group.

As we can see, in all countries those individuals with tertiary education were by far the group most likely to report trusting others. And in almost every country, those with post-secondary non-tertiary education were more likely to trust others than those with primary or lower secondary education. The OECD's report <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a> provides similar descriptive evidence for other social outcomes. The report concludes that adults with higher qualifications are more likely to report desirable social outcomes, including good or excellent health, participation in volunteer activities, interpersonal trust, and political efficacy. And these results hold after controlling for literacy, gender, age and monthly earnings.

As usual, correlation does not imply causation ‚Äì but it does show an important pattern that supports the idea that education is indeed necessary to produce social capital.

For example, in Norway, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education reporting to trust others increases by 20 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education. Similarly, after accounting for literacy proficiency, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education increases by 16 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education."[/ref]</h6>

<h4>Countries with higher educational attainment in the past are more likely to have democratic political regimes today</h4>
A long-standing theory in political science stipulates that a country's level of education attainment is a key determinant of the emergence and sustainability of democratic political institutions, both because it promotes political participation at the individual level, and because it fosters a collective sense of civic duty.

Under this hypothesis, therefore, we should expect that education levels in a country correlate positively with measures of democratisation in subsequent years. The following visualization shows that this positive correlation is indeed supported by the data. As we can see, countries where adults had a higher average education level in 1970, are also more likely to have democratic political regimes today (you can read more about measures of democracy in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democratisation">Democratization</a>).

As usual, these results should be interpreted carefully, because they do not imply a causal link: it does not prove that increasing education necessarily produces democratic outcomes everywhere in the world. 
However, the academic research here does suggest that there is a causal link between education and democratization ‚Äì indeed, a number of empirical academic papers have found that this positive relationship remains after controlling for many other country characteristics (see, for example, Lutz, Crespo-Cuaresma, and Abbasi‚ÄêShavazi 2010[ref]Lutz, W., Crespo Cuaresma, J., &amp; Abbasi‚ÄêShavazi, M. J. (2010). Demography, education, and democracy: Global trends and the case of Iran. Population and Development Review, 36(2), 253-281.[/ref]).

<h4>Women‚Äôs education is inversely correlated with child mortality</h4>
An important body of literature stipulates that women's education leads to lower <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> because it contributes towards healthier habits and choices, including child spacing (see Brown and Barrett 1991 for a more detailed conceptualization of the mechanisms).[ref]Angela W. Browne &amp; Hazel R. Barrett (1991) Female Education in Sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa: the key to development?, Comparative Education, 27:3, 275-285, DOI: 10.1080/0305006910270303. Available online <a href="ttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305006910270303">here</a>.

The following visualization shows the strong cross-country correlation between child mortality and educational attainment.

<h4>Education outcomes predict economic growth</h4>
The economics literature has long studied whether the level of education in a country is a determinant of economic growth. This question is motivated by the notion that aggregate education ('human capital') generates positive spill-over effects for everyone. A classic example of a mechanism though which education may yield such positive economic externalities, is that aggregate education improves a country‚Äôs ability to innovate, as well as imitate and adapt new technologies, hence enabling 'technological progress' and sustained growth (see Lindahl and Krueger (2001) for an overview of further macroeconomic theories of education and growth).[ref]Lindahl, M., and Krueger, A. B. (2001). Education for Growth: Why and for Whom?. Journal of Economic Literature, 39(4), 1101-1136.[/ref]

While early studies found that schooling levels were poor predictors of economic growth, more recent studies ‚Äì that crucially made use of better data ‚Äì confirm the expected positive link. Lutz, Creso Cuaresma, and Sanderson (2008)[ref]Lutz, W., Creso Cuaresma, J., &amp; Sanderson, W. (2008). The demography of educational attainment and economic growth. Science, 319(5866), 1047-1048.[/ref] conclude that <em>"better education does not only lead to higher individual income, but also is a necessary (although not always sufficient) precondition for long-term economic growth."</em>

The following plot, from Hanushek and Woessmann (2010),[ref]Hanushek E A and W√∂√ümann L (2010), Education and Economic Growth. In: Penelope Peterson, Eva Baker, Barry McGaw, (Editors), International Encyclopedia of Education. volume 2, pp. 245-252. Oxford: Elsevier.[/ref] provides a basic representation of the association between years of schooling and economic growth using recent available data. This type of graph, called a 'partial regression plot' shows the relationship between schooling and growth <em>after accounting for other country characteristics</em>. More precisely, this plot is a graphical representation of the correlation between average years of schooling in 1960, and the average annual rate of GDP growth in 1960‚Äì2000, after accounting for initial differences in GDP levels in 1960. As we can see, there is a strong positive relationship. This coincides with other studies showing that historical increases in the number of universities across countries are positively associated with subsequent growth of GDP per capita (Valero and Van Reenen 2016).[ref]Valero, A., &amp; Van Reenen, J. (2016). The economic impact of universities: Evidence from across the globe (No. w22501). National Bureau of Economic Research.[/ref]

<!--------------DATA QUALITY + SOURCES-------------------------->
<h2>Main data sources</h2>
There are two important sources of long-run cross-country data on education attainment. The most recent one is Lee and Lee (2016).[ref]Lee, J. W., &amp; Lee, H. (2016). Human capital in the long run. Journal of Development Economics.[/ref] These estimates rely on a variety of historical sources, and expand existing estimates from previous studies by using a significant number of new census observations. The authors relied on information about the years of establishment of the oldest schools at different education levels in individual countries, in order to adjust their estimates; and they also used data on repetition ratios to adjust for school repeaters.

The other main source on this topic are the estimates from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and the Vienna Institute of Demography (VID). These institutions reconstructed educational attainment distributions by age and sex for 120 countries for the years 1970‚Äì2000. These estimates correspond to 'back projections': researchers used educational attainment estimates from the UN for the year 2000, and projected backwards from this single year. You can read more about this source of data and the underlying methodology in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/#data-quality-definitions">Education Projections</a>.

For this reason economists frequently recommend to include measures of subjective well-being in measures of social progress - and in particular to augment the usual measure of economic prosperity (GDP per capita).[ref]Particularly important was the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commision whose is work is online <a href="http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm">here</a>. It also relates to Bhutan's famous measurement of Gross National Happiness (GNH) as indicator of progress (Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_happiness">here</a>).[/ref]

'Overall happiness is the degree to which an individual judges the overall quality of his/her own life-as-a-whole favorably. In other words: how much one likes the life one leads.' This is the definition given by the widely used 'World Database of Happiness' (<a href="http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/">here</a>).

<h3>Deaton's analysis of Life Satisfaction across Countries</h3>
One of the most influential recent study was done by the Princeton professor Angus Deaton in 2008. He had the enviable opportunity to study a dataset of life satisfaction that was constructed by the Gallup Organization. This data comes from an identical questionnaire that was used to ask people in 132 countries of the world about theirlife satisfaction.[ref]The Gallup Organization describes their survey, the translations of the questionnaires in different languages, data coverage of this poll and the statistical validity <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140902045224/http://www.gallup.com/strategicconsulting/156923/worldwide-research-methodology.aspx">here</a>.[/ref]

In the graph reprinted below, Deaton plotted the way that people view their lives versus their income. The result is very clear and shows a strong positive correlation between economic prosperity and people's view of their own lives.
<h6>Global data on the correlation between income and life satisfaction from Gallup World Poll ‚Äì Deaton (2008)[ref]</h6>

The correlation between incomes and life satisfaction is not just high across countries but also within countries. The same Gallup data that Deaton used was analysed by Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers who studied the relationship between life satisfaction and income within each country. The correlation coefficients (this statistical measure is explained in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient">Wikipedia</a>) between life satisfaction and income are shown in the following graph - they are positive in all but one country and indicate that higher incomes go together with higher life satisfaction.

So far we have seen that life satisfaction differs widely between different countries and that this variation can be explained in the differences of economic prosperity of the country. This link between income and life satisfaction is true across and within countries.

All of this information is successfully shown in a single graph by Stevenson and Wolfers. It is again visualizes the Gallup World Poll data - the black solid circles show the correlation between life satisfaction and income <em>across</em> countries, the slope of the arrow represents the correlation coefficients that measures how strongly incomes and life satisfaction are associated <em>within</em> each country.

GDP per capita is at purchasing power parity in constant 2000 international dollars.'[/ref]

<h3>History and Culture</h3>
Another recent confirmation of the huge variability of subjective well-being across countries and its strong link with income is presented by researchers working on the World Value Survey. Their result is plotted below. Note that the income scale on the x-axis is not logarithmic as in the graph shown before, for this reason the correlation of subjective well-being appears to be flat for high income countries.

The black line shows the average relation between income and subjective well-being and income. The fact that similar countries lie collectively above or below this line shows that income - and its many correlates - are not the only determinant of subjective well-being. The cultural background might explain why people in the culturally similar countries of Latin America have a higher subjective well-being than their comparably low income would predict.

The shared experience of the grim communist era in many countries might explain why the subjective well being of the people in the ex-communist countries is lower than their income would predict. But again for both samples the correlation between incomes and well-being is intact.

<h3>Comparing Life Satisfaction through Time</h3>
The relationship between income and happiness/life satisfaction over time appears to be less definite when we do not look at the correlation across countries but within the same country over time. The famous result of the early literature on this relationship was that there is no link; this result is called the Easterlin Paradox, named after the economist Richard Easterlin who published this result of a non-link between the two variables.[ref]The original paper is Easterlin (1974). Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence. It is hosted at the website of the New York Times <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/04/16/business/Easterlin1974.pdf">here</a>.[/ref] In 2010 Easterlin restated his paradox.[ref]Easterlin, McVey, Switek, Sawangfa, and Zweig (2010) - The happiness‚Äìincome paradox revisited. In Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107, 52, 22463--22468. Online <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463">here</a>.[/ref]

It is important to be clear that Easterlin is not saying that the results shown above are wrong. He is not saying that there is no relation between income and happiness across countries. It is precisely the observation that there is a strong link across countries why he speaks of a paradox - in the 2011 article he says: 'If there were no positive relation in the cross-section, there would be no paradox!'

The time series of measured subjective well-being in Japan over three decades of strong economic growth in Japan is shown below - and is taken from a publication of Easterlin.

In the remainder of this entry I want to look at the inter-temporal data on life satisfaction. Because incomes have been growing over the last century in most countries, if we claim incomes and life satisfaction do not go together, it suffices to say that it is life satisfaction that is not rising.

Comparisons of life satisfaction over time are only possible for developed countries. In developing countries researchers have only recently started to measure life satisfaction, so an inter-temporal perspective cannot be assumed.

Of all the developed countries, the most often cited case as a proof of the Easterlin Paradox is the case of Japan. The data for these claims are from the 'Life in Nation' surveys that started to measure life satisfaction as early as 1958 in Japan. Japan is a very interesting case because it had very rapid economic growth over the post-war period until the early 1990s. The growth miracle of Japan meant average growth rates of more than 5% over the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

How did this affect life satisfaction of the Japanese? Previous researchers looked at the data in the 'Life in Nation' surveys uncritically and concluded that life satisfaction did only oscillate around the long term average, and over the long run the Japanese became neither substantially more nor substantially less satisfied.

Stevenson and Wolfers whose research I quoted before examined the Japanese data over the last 50 years very carefully and translated all of the survey questions. One example of how the questions changed: For the first 6 years the survey was kept consistent, but then in 1964 the top category of the responses was changed from the catch-all, ‚ÄúAlthough I am not innumerably satisfied, I am generally satisfied with life now‚Äù to the much more narrow ‚ÄúCompletely satisfied.‚Äù Therefore it does not come as a surprise that the proportion reporting their well-being in this highest category dropped from 18.3% to 4.4%.

Stevenson and Wolfers analyze all surveys from 1958 to 2007 and find that 'properly viewed, [this analysis] leaves us with four periods within which we can make useful assessments of trends in subjective well-being in Japan'.

These results, together with short summaries of how the survey questions changed, are shown in the following graph.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Life-Satisfaction-and-GDP-per-Capita-over-Time-in-Japan-Stevenson-Wolfers.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1573" src="//ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Life-Satisfaction-and-GDP-per-Capita-over-Time-in-Japan-Stevenson-Wolfers.png" alt="Life Satisfaction and GDP per Capita over Time in Japan - Stevenson &amp; Wolfers" width="1097" height="801" /></a></p>
Treating the surveys of Japan as the four distinct datasets that they really are, the authors find what we would expect on the basis of the cross-sectional data: life satisfaction rises with rising incomes (until the early 1990s), and over the so called 'lost decade' of the 1990s and the stagnating incomes of the recent past life satisfaction is falling.

The authors' argument is compelling in light of their examination of the surveys: 'By construction, the levels of these four series are not comparable, and hence comparisons within, but not between, series are valid.' From their careful analysis summarized in the graph above, we learn that life satisfaction rises as economic growth lifts societies out of poverty. The conclusion is that Easterlin's Paradox should be more seen as an important warning to be critical with data sets that combine data points without checking if this data can be combined. This example makes clear why the research with identical questionnaires in different countries is so insightful for our understanding of how poverty and low life satisfaction and prosperity and high life satisfaction are related.

It might also be relevant that compared with the other countries the Japanese are experiencing a lower life satisfaction than you would predict given their high income - note that Japan scores lower than the black line in the graph in the previous section.

Having this warning in mind, I still want to cautiously refer to one study of inter-temporal comparisons of happiness. The 'World Value Survey' carries out polls across the globe since the 1980s. Based on this research Inglehart, Welzel and Foa looked at the changes of both happiness and self-assessed freedom of choice. The strong correlation between both measures and the trend towards a freer and happier world is shown in this last graph of this entry.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
The main reason why direct measures of personal well-being are not more commonly used is that it is very hard to measure.[ref]There is very serious and well argumented crticism of using happiness as an indicator for social health and succesfull policy. A very good and interesting argument is presented by Deirdre N. McCloskey in her article 'Happyism' in The New Republic freely online <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/magazine/103952/happyism-deirdre-mccloskey-economics-happiness#">here</a>.[/ref]
<h3>Measurement and Data</h3>
A major distinction should be made between positive or pleasant emotions (happiness) and well-being and life-satisfaction. The first is concerned with the experience of positive emotions at any given time, the second is concerned with rather long-term evaluation of one's own life - it is thus closer to view that philosophers and religious thinkers often take. Normative concepts of the good life matter more for this self-assesment than momentary emotions.

Measurement of the two components of the experience of one's own life is typically done by interviews and surveys.
<h3>Problems of Happiness Assessments</h3>
There are two main problems:

Across countries: Cultural and linguistic differences might mean that the same survey questions are viewed differently by people from different cultural backgrounds and depending on the language.

Across time: Comparisons of happiness measures over time unfortunately should be checked especially critically. The reason is that it is very often the case that the questions are changed and that the changes of happiness over time reflects less the change of happiness of the people and rather changes of the assesment by which the happiness is measured.
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
The World Database of Happiness (hosted at the 'Erasmus University Rotterdam' <a href="http://www1.eur.nl/fsw/happiness/trendnat/framepage.htm">here</a>) encompasses a wealth of data and study results on happiness - from the national to the global level across. It includes measure of inequality of happiness. And there are many time series for a huge range of countries. You also find correlational studies with just about measure you can imagine.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Europe</h3>
<p>Eisner (2003) describes the secular trend of homicide rates in Europe and has collected data for this research paper.¬†From his database Eisner constructed data for several European regions and presented this in a table. I added the latest available data to Eisner's data and visualized this in the following graph. European homicide rates have dramatically decreased over the last millennium and have remained steadily low over the past 50 years. Italy has historically had higher homicide rates than other European countries, but today those rates have reached Northern European levels.</p>

<p>The declining homicides in some regions and stagnating high homicides in other regions caused a huge inequality in violence in the 19th century as can be seen in the following map.¬†Over the course of the last century this picture has changed: the south of Europe has followed northwestern Europe and now has similarly low violence. The remaining inequality is now between a more violent Eastern Europe and a less violent Western Europe.</p>

<h3>USA</h3>
<p>The homicide rate in the US has fallen dramatically over the past few centuries.¬†The following graph shows the fall in the homicide rate in relation to various armed conflicts in New England. In the early colonial days in America, the homicide rate was incredibly high. But as the colonies became more established and orderly, the rate fell, except for the time during the American Revolution when the colonies were understandably amidst upheaval. It's important to note that one cannot directly¬†derive¬†from this graph a causal relationship between these conflicts and the homicide rate.</p>

<p>Homicide rates in the US have declined dramatically over history, but they still remain much higher than other industrialized states. Below, we can see that in the 1960s and 1970s, the US, Canada and England all experienced increases in violent crime, but the increase in the US was much more dramatic than in the other two nations. These rates have since fallen in the US, but homicide is still much more common there than in Canada and England.</p>

<p>After a period of higher violence in the 1970s and 1980s the US experiences a marked decrease in homicides and other crime rates. Recent data is published in the US census¬†<a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0306.pdf">here</a>. From this data it can be seen that the downward trend continued in the recent economic crisis.</p>

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<p>There are two very different sources for historical data on homicide rates depending on the era discussed. For the last few decades, statistical offices have recorded homicide rates as part of the vital statistics. Eisner (2003) notes that "in most European countries, data series start during the second half of the nineteenth century, although Swedish national death statistics were introduced in the middle of the eighteenth century".<br />
For earlier historical periods, researchers have reconstructed the long-term changes in homicide rates from historical records that often originated from some form of legal documentation of the crimes. Although there are gaps in the reconstructed data,¬†and there are uncertainties in both the number of homicides and the size of the population, the historical record is more complete than one might assume. One reason for this is the great social importance of these crimes. Violent killings were of concern for a long time, and they were therefore often reliably registered. In some cases, or for prehistoric times, it is additionally possible to use the insights from forensic archaeologists, who can determine the causes of death from skeletal remains.<br />
Usually homicide rates are calculated as homicides per 100,000 people per year.</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<h3>Historical sources</h3>
<p>The¬†<em>'Historical Violence Database' </em>Data on violence from medieval times to the present, mainly in Western Europe and the US, has been collected in the 'Historical Violence Database' at the Ohio State University. In addition to homicide rates for many countries this database also includes qualitative information - among much more inforamtion also on the place and the cause of death and on the victim and the perpetrator.<br />
The website can be found here:¬†<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121120195113/http://cjrc.osu.edu:80/researchprojects/hvd/">Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University</a></p>

<h3>1 Layout and Writing of data-entries</h3>
<h4>1.1 Main structure</h4>
Each data entry should contain the four sections outlined below. <strong>We have a <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/page-template/">page template</a> that you can use to write an Our World In Data data-entry.</strong>

Open this <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_exampe-data-entry-with-annotations-‚Äì-war-and-peace-after-1945-2.pdf" rel="">Exampe Data Entry with annotations ‚Äì War and Peace after 1945</a> that presents the structure of a data entry clearly.

&nbsp;

<strong>Structure</strong>

Before the first section (Empirical View), a short introductory paragraph should be written to introduce and contextualise the
topic. This introductory text should also motivate the data entry and give readers an idea of what to expect. In order of appearance, the four main sections are:

<strong>First section: Empirical View:</strong> This should contain an overview of the data on the topic. Ideally the overview should be as complete as possible across both countries and time. The data presented should be discussed briefly and any charts should be created with the Grapher tool.The data-visualisations must show how this particular aspect has changed over the long term and what the global picture is today.

Any technical definitions should be relegated to the Data Quality &amp; Definitions section (see below). Subsections should be used to explore different aspects of the data.

<strong>1.1 and 2.1 Subsections</strong>

The first two sections are broken into blocks of:
<ol>
 	<li>Headline of subsection in &lt;h3&gt;</li>
 	<li>Explanatory text</li>
 	<li>Graph</li>
</ol>
Here is an example for this structure of one subsection:

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-11-at-11.40.30.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6969"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6969 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-11-at-11.40.30-400x358.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-11 at 11.40.30" width="400" height="358" /></a>

The chart is at the bottom and between the &lt;h3&gt; heading and the chart is a short text explaining:
<ul>
 	<li>(if necessary) what you have to know to understand the chart</li>
 	<li>(if necessary) how to read the chart</li>
 	<li>Some interpretation of what there is to see, highlighting the important facts that are shown in the chart to help the reader understand what there is to see.</li>
 	<li>References to papers &amp; books &amp; web resources that tell you more about it. Summarize what the research says about this aspect and refer to the research.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Second section: Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences:</strong> Each topic should have its own subsections but there is no need to create an arbitrary subsection for Correlates, Determinants or Consequences. An example for an education data entry may be ‚ÄòFemale Education and Child Mortality'.

Data-visualisations and text that explain what is driving the observed trends and why they are relevant ‚Äì and text to complement the visualisation (discussion of research that shows causal links etc.)

<strong>Third section Data Quality &amp; Definitions:</strong> Any weaknesses in the data identified by OWID or discussed in the literature should be
explained here. Examples of weaknesses include selection problems, coverage, missing data, censoring, and unusual
definitions. It is important to state the definitions used to code the data here.

<strong>Fourth section: Data Sources:</strong> This section should include links to the websites of the relevant datasets or data providers, whether or
not they are presented in the data entry, as well as providing summary information on the data. The formatting for this
section can be found [sec:Data-Sources].
<h4>1.2 Writing Our World In Data</h4>
It is now possible to use LaTeX. Here is an example page I just put up:¬†<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/latex-maths/" target="_blank" data-behavior="truncate">http://ourworldindata.org/latex-maths/</a>
For this we are using Quick LaTeX plugin (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/" target="_blank" data-behavior="truncate">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/</a>).

<b>Writing Maths (in LaTeX)</b>

It is possible to use LaTeX on Our World In Data. <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/latex-maths/">Here</a> is an example page on Our World In Data that shows the capabilities. A detailed explanation can be found here:¬†<a href="http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/" target="_blank" data-behavior="truncate">http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/</a>
For this we are using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quicklatex/">Quick LaTeX plugin</a> and you find more information there.
There are two ways of including LaTeX in a page:

<b>1) LaTeX in one paragraph:</b> For most cases it is enough to just have one formula here and there. Then¬†you may always place a LaTeX expression within <em>latex .. /latex </em><em>in squared brackets "[]"</em> shortcodes.

This is an example:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-6963 size-full" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-11-at-11.26.05.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-11 at 11.26.05" width="272" height="211" />

<b>2) LaTeX on an entire page:
</b>
If we really need to include a lot of LaTeX on a page then you can write <em>latexpage in squared brackets "[]"</em> on the top of the page.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-6964 size-full" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-11-at-11.27.32.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-11 at 11.27.32" width="127" height="38" />You then do not need the latex .. /latex shortcodes in any paragraph.

<strong>General conventions when writing Our World In Data</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>We want to use American spelling (if you see British spelling Americanize it.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 HTML headings</h3>
It is recommended that all data entries should be edited directly in HTML to prevent unexpected formatting issues not apparent in
the WYSIWYG editor. When creating new data entries, it is possible to copy and paste the HTML code from another page or the
included template to save time. Headers are used in the following way:
<ul>
 	<li>h1: Do not use!
<ul>
 	<li>&lt;h1&gt; not &lt;/h1&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>h2: <strong>Headings</strong> for the four main sections listed above only.
<ul>
 	<li>&lt;h2&gt; Empirical View &lt;/h2&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>h3: <strong>Subsections</strong> should be tagged this way.
<ul>
 	<li>&lt;h3&gt; Subsection 1 &lt;/h3&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>h4: Not commonly used (but okay to use if really necessary, it will be a sub-subsection).
<ul>
 	<li>&lt;h4&gt; sub-subsection &lt;/h4&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>h5: Headings for data sources only (see Section on Data-Sources below).
<ul>
 	<li>&lt;h5&gt; World Bank Education Data &lt;/h5&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>h6: Image titles only.
<ul>
 	<li>&lt;h6&gt; Mean years of schooling, 1970-2014 - World Bank &lt;/h6&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2 Links</h3>
Links to other websites or data entries can be added using the Wordpress tool or by directly writing the HTML code. Links are standardised in the following way:

<strong>‚Ä¢ External site or data entry:</strong> Links to external websites should always (i) open in a new tab, and (ii) use the link as the text unless the link is too long or messy. To force links to open in a new tab use the target=‚Äú_blank‚Äù attribute. Below are two examples:

‚Äì If the link is short and clean, it should appear as <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>:
<pre>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"&gt; www.google.com&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
‚Äì If the link is long or messy, it is preferable to use some identifying label rather than the address, for example <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=ABC">ABC</a>:
<pre>&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=ABC" target="_blank"&gt; ABC &lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<strong>‚Ä¢ Link within data entry:</strong> Links to other sections within the same data entry should not open in a new tab. The text displayed for
the link should be the name of the section. For example:

‚Äì Link to the Data Sources section should appear as <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/quality-of-education-drop-out-rates/#data-sources">Data Sources</a>:

&lt;a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/quality-of-education-drop-out-rates/#data-sources"&gt;Data Sources &lt;/a&gt;

<strong>Our Conventions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Use meaningfull titles for links ‚Äì i.e., instead of saying "Online here" have the article title as the hyperlink. This is because sites on the internet constantly change change and a broken link with a meaningfull title is more useful than a broken 'online here'.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.1 Broken Links</h3>
Links and references to external sources can eventually become invalid for a variety of reasons. Perhaps their author moves between institutions, or the source does a big redesign of their site layout. Broken links on Our World in Data are periodically tested and logged by the <a href="/wp-admin/tools.php?page=view-broken-links">Broken Link Checker</a>. Hovering a link and selecting "Edit URL" within the link checker interface will let you replace it. In most cases, the automatically suggested archive.org replacement will be appropriate. However if the original page contained complex embedded content or was e.g. a link to buy a book then it may not be amenable to archival and you'll want to fully replace it.
<h3>3 Images</h3>
All images should be uploaded using the Wordpress tool on the page editor (see Figure below). The standard formatting used by Wordpress for images inserted using the tool should be fine in most cases.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_image-upload.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6919 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_image-upload-400x240.png" alt="Image upload" width="400" height="240" /></a>

The filename of the image will become its title in the Wordpress image database and is also displayed when the image is clicked by users. For this reason, <strong>remember to give the image an appropriate filename</strong> before it is uploaded or to change the title once it has been uploaded. This will also make it easier to find the image in future using the Wordpress search feature.

All images should have a title above written using the HTML <strong>header 6 ‚Äì</strong> &lt;h6&gt;title&lt;/6&gt; ‚Äì discussed in the above section HTML-headings.

<strong>Images must be clickable</strong> by the reader so that they open in full resolution. The way to do this is to add a link in the image that refers to the "Media File" (which is the image itself). You add links in the menu in the "Add Media" section or in the edit mode of the image (you get there by clicking on the image in the editor and then choosing the pencil icon).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-6970 size-full" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-11-at-11.42.14.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-11 at 11.42.14" width="316" height="206" />

The title of all images and visualisations that are not created by Our World In Data must have the source in the title ‚Äì and the detailed information associated with it in a footnote. An example for the title format is "Causes of child mortality in Asia in 1990 ‚Äì UNICEF (2007)(ref)UNICEF (2007) ‚Äì Committing to Child Survival: A Promise Renewed ‚Äì Progress Report 2007.(/ref)" Of course the ref must be in [] instead of (), but it would actually create a footnote if I wouldn't put it in () in this example.

&nbsp;

<strong>Our conventions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Add alt-text to all images.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4 References</h3>
References are a key element of all data entries and should be used to indicate the source of any quotes, facts or images. All
references will appear at the end of the data entry in a standardised way. HTML does not have a built in reference feature
however OWID makes use of the Wordpress plugin Side Matter to create references.
<h4>4.1 Citations</h4>
Two <em>ref</em> tags should be placed around the source, with the first tag placed at the intended location of the superscript number indicating a reference. One easy way to correctly format references is to search for the source on <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk">Google Scholar</a> and click cite (see Figure below).

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-6922 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_citation1-400x196.png" alt="Citation1" width="400" height="196" />

To display the title of the work in italics use the HTML tags &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or the Wordpress tool. An example using the ref tags is below; it is not shown as text ‚Äì but rather an image ‚Äì as WordPress would otherwise show the footnote and not the code for the footnote:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-6932 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-08-at-17.13.54-400x110.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-08 at 17.13.54" width="400" height="110" />

Notice that these tags are not the same as the usual HTML &lt;/&gt; type tags.

If the source is a journal article, it is important to link the citation to the journal page where it is hosted or JSTOR (preferably not a direct pdf link).

&nbsp;
<h4>4.2 Image sources</h4>
Referencing for images is slightly more tricky. For the reference to display properly the first ref tag should be placed within the
header tag, right before it is closed. After the closing header tag, the source should follow before the closing ref tag. For
clarity, see the example below where the crucial order of ref opening and h6 closing is highlighted in bold letters:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-6933 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-08-at-17.15.38-400x117.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-08 at 17.15.38" width="400" height="117" />
<h3>5 Data Sources</h3>
The major data providers and datasets for the topic in question should be listed in the Data Sources section. These should all be
formatted in the following way:

&lt;h5&gt; TITLE &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;: ... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographical coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time span:&lt;/strong&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available at:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="..."target="_blank"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="datasources-hr" /&gt;

&nbsp;

<strong>An example from the terrorism data entry is:</strong>

&lt;h5&gt; International Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events (ITERATE) &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;: International terrorist incidents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographical coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Global by country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time span:&lt;/strong&gt; 1978-2011&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available at:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://library.duke.edu/data/collections/iterate"target="_blank"&gt;http://library.duke.edu/data/collections/iterate&lt;/a&gt;, restricted to Duke University members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="datasources-hr" /&gt;
<h3>6 Tables</h3>
Generally we try to avoid tables and think of a way to display the information visually.

However there are cases in which (a small) table is more useful, in these cases we use the WordPress Plugin TablePress.

In the editor you click on TablePress (in the left column) and then on add new table.

In the 'Input' tab you can chose the option 'Manual Input' and there you can copy-paste the table directly from Excel. On the following page you can add the title of the table and specify the settings (please do not use fancy Features ‚Äì they are useful for large tables, but we want to avoid large tables).

Finally you copy the shortcode for the table you created, the shortcode specifies the table id in brackets, and you copy it into the data entry to the position where it should appear.

In the editor you have to give the table a h6-headline and add the sources in the same way as for the images ‚Äì attached to headline. If everything works it looks like this:
<h6>Age of Marriage of Women and Marital Fertility in Europe before 1790[ref]</h6>
All of this data is taken from Gregory Clark (2007) ‚Äì A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World. Princeton University Press.
Clark's sources by country are:
Belgium ‚Äì Flinn, 1981
France ‚Äì Flinn, 1981 and Weir 1984
Germany ‚Äì Flinn, 1981
England ‚Äì Flinn, 1981
Netherlands ‚Äì De Vries, 1985, 665.

<h2>OWID Grapher</h2>
This second part explains the use and capabilities of the Our-World-In-Data-Grapher, the tool developed by us for OurWorldInData.

General information and a video of how to use the Grapher can be found on the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher/">dedicated page</a>.
<h3>B1 Uploading Datasets</h3>
To create visualisation the data must be uploaded into the Grapher <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/charts">here</a>.
The chart builder currently only recognises .csv files. These files can be created and manipulated using Microsoft Excel or other statistical software packages. In addition to the file type requirement, the data needs to be formatted correctly. There are two main ways the data can be formatted, the first is as a single variable dataset, and the second is for multi-variable datasets.
The latter format can also be used to upload single variable datasets. If the data is not formatted correctly, the data upload tool will display the error with the current file.
<h4>1.1 Homogenising Country Names ‚Äì The OWID¬†Country Code Tool</h4>
All datasets uploaded¬†into the Grapher must contain country (or territory) names that meet either the OWID or ISO3 standard. For the purpose of converting names into either of these standards, there is a .xls macro tool. There is also a dedicated <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/the-owid-country-code-tool/">page about the OWID-Country-Code-Tool</a>.

The¬†.xls tool¬†is programmed to¬†convert common names into OWID or ISO3 names/codes. For example,¬†writing "Korea, Dem. Rep." or "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" will give "North Korea" under the OWID Name output standard. If a common name or abbreviation is not recognized by the tool, you can edit the background data. To add new spellings to the Country Code Tool do this:
<ol>
 	<li>open the "Data" tab in the tool,</li>
 	<li>scroll down to the row where the names for the required country are,</li>
 	<li>add a new row immediately below the last country name (that is, below the last existing spelling for that country),</li>
 	<li>enter the new spelling in the column 'COUNTRY NAME' so that this spelling will be recognized by the tool from now on,</li>
 	<li>ensure consistency in all columns (that is, make sure that the fields for ID, continent, etc. match all the other rows for that country).</li>
</ol>
<strong>Since data is sometimes available for territories that do not have ISO3 codes (e.g. Kosovo), authors are strongly encouraged to always use OWID names as the preferred standard. Failing to do this may result in inconsistencies, such as repeated observations¬†for a country.</strong>

If a territory does not exist in the tool, but you consider that it should for the purpose of a specific dataset (e.g. a dataset with observations for Melanesia), you can add it to the background data. To add a new country/territory to the structure of OurWorldInData do this:
<ol>
 	<li>open the "Data" tab in the tool,</li>
 	<li>scroll down to the last row,</li>
 	<li>fill in all column fields, including the next available ID and an OWID code following the structure OWID_XXX (where XXX can be any three letters),</li>
 	<li>email the OurWorldInData-web-developer with the list of new OWID names and OWID codes to update the SQL database.</li>
</ol>
Following any update of the .xls tool, the new version is saved with a new name (e.g. Country_Name_Tool_v2.1.xls) and any changes are documented in the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/the-owid-country-code-tool/">page about the OWID-Country-Code-Tool</a>.

&nbsp;
<h4>1.2 Single variable datasets</h4>
With panel data (time and space), the first cell of the first row A1 should contain the time interval used (e.g. ‚Äòyear‚Äô). The remaining cells of the first row should contain the years of observations. The first column should contain the names of the countries. The country names must be either the OWID name or the ISO3 code. To convert lists of countries in one format to another use the OWID Country Code Tool (see section 1.1¬†Country Code Tool for more details). The Figure below is an example using the United Nation's Human Development Index; the country names are the ISO3 codes.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_single-var.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6923"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6923 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_single-var-400x291.png" alt="single var" width="400" height="291" /></a>
<h4>1.3 Multi-variable datasets</h4>
Multi-variable datasets are those that contain panel data for several different variables. The first column should contain the country names with the first cell (A1) containing the word ‚Äòcountry‚Äô. The second column should contain the year of the observation with the first cell (B1) containing the word ‚Äòyear‚Äô.
The remaining columns should contain the variables in the dataset, where the first cell of each column is the name of the variable. See the Figure below for an example using the Correlates of War dataset.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_multi-var.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6924"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6924 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_multi-var-400x279.png" alt="multi var" width="400" height="279" /></a>
<h4>2. Storing the original dataset and documentation</h4>
Take John Cochrane's advice seriously: <em>"Document your work. A fellow graduate student must be able to sit down with your paper and all alone reproduce every number in it from instructions given in the paper, and any print or web appendices."</em>

We need to make sure that at any later point in time we understand clearly where the data presented on OWID comes from and what we did with it before we uploaded it into the Grapher.
<ul>
 	<li>We need to know the original source.</li>
 	<li>We need to know all the necessary manipulation ‚Äì standardization of country names, rounding, merging of data etc.</li>
</ul>
For that reason we have the internal OWID database in Dropbox. That database is structured in the 16 categories and subcategories and for each dataset (or variable) we have a folder with the 3 subfolders 'original', 'manipulation', and 'uploaded'.

The folder 'original' only has the original dataset(s) as downloaded. nothing else. Once the original file is there, you take that file and copy it to the folder 'Manipulation' and either document your manipulation or save Stata .do-files or R files there that make it clear how you manipulated the file. Once this is done, you finally copy that file to the 'uploaded' folder and save it there as an .csv file. And then you upload that file into the Grapher and document all of it in words in the source information.

Here is an example of what the structure of the Dropbox database looks like:

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-03-11-at-16.04.04.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7200"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7200" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-03-11-at-16.04.04-750x258.png" alt="Data structure" width="750" height="258" /></a>
<h3>B2 How to make charts</h3>
For explanation I'm describing the process of making a line chart with a map ‚Äì other chart types have specifics that will be mentioned with the example of these different chart types below.
<ol>
 	<li>Click on "Charts" in the main menu on the left</li>
 	<li>You will have a preview of the chart on the left (this is pretty empty for now) and the menu for authoring the chart on the right. The author options are distributed over 5 tabs ‚Äì from Basic to Export and can be extended to the Map tab as the 6th tab.</li>
 	<li>On the first panel
<ol>
 	<li>Choose a <strong>title</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Never specify a time frame or name countries in the title. Instead you can use *time* and *country* as placeholders in the titles of visualizations. The Grapher will then automatically show the right time range. The *country* option is only relevant for Change-Country-Charts (see 8.2.2 below) ‚Äì but we should generally not mention specific country names since it becomes weird if the title says China and Brazil and some reader adds Norway and removes China ‚Äì a screenshot of the chart for example becomes then unusable for the reader.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Choose a <strong>subtitle</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The subtitle should explain the chart so that the chart can stand on its own. So it necessary to give an explanation of the variable. How is it measured? What does the measure mean exactly?</li>
 	<li>The subtitle can also include an explanation of how to read the chart in case this is necessary.</li>
 	<li>It is therefore okay if the subtitle is 2 or 3 lines long.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Choose the type of chart that you want to have. All options are here except maps which are a special case ‚Äì they are shown on a different layer and can be added on the Export Tab. (If you only want to make a map you have to chose a chart on the Basic Tab even though it won't be seen in the end.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>At any point throughout the process of making a chart you can click on the green Create Chart button ‚Äì the first time you click this it will create a chart, the second time it will update the saved chart.</li>
 	<li>On the second panel ‚Äì Data ‚Äì you can
<ol>
 	<li>Add a variable. All variables are categorized and can be found in the category. They can also be searched.</li>
 	<li>Once you found the right variable ‚Äì let's say "Penn World Table 8.1 (Real GDP at chained PPPs in 2005US$)" ‚Äì you can select this and then <em><strong>you have to drag and drop</strong></em> this variable name on the field where this variable should be shown. In case of a simple line chart this is the Y Axis field.</li>
 	<li>Now all the countries should be displayed and the chart will look very messy. In option F you can now specify which countries should be shown by default.
<ol>
 	<li>If you want to change the color of a country you can click on it and you will see a menu.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Option G ‚Äì the time frame you can leave as it is.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>On the 3rd panel ‚Äì Axis ‚Äì you can
<ol>
 	<li>Add an Y-axis label (we don't need to put year on the X-axis as this is obvious)</li>
 	<li>You can also add "$" as the Y-axis suffix</li>
 	<li>Max and Min are rarely necessary to specify as the Grapher adjusts these automatically</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>The Styling Tab
<ol>
 	<li>has the important option to choose the type of line ‚Äì please use "line with dots" if the data is patchy so that is clear to the user that the timeseries is "graphically linearly interpolated" when there is no dot.</li>
 	<li>In Option M you can specify the popup units that is shown on hovering over the chart. Here is a small bug: This option only works by clicking the tick away and then adding the tick again. Here it is important to restrict the number of decimal places to something useful.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>On the Export Tab
<ol>
 	<li>You can add a Map Tab</li>
 	<li>Choose the default tab on which the chart is loaded
<ol>
 	<li>Note that you can change the URL on which a chart is loaded also with adding the ?tab= option to the chart's URL
<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58"> http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58</a>
<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58?tab=map"> http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58?tab=map</a>
<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58?tab=sources"> http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58?tab=sources</a>
<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58?tab=data"> http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58?tab=data</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>On the Export Tab you can also copy the line of html code to embed the iFrame.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>The map tab
<ol>
 	<li>Gap between years is 1 by default. This means that a map for every year can be selected by the viewer. You can increase this gap ‚Äì for example if data is only available for every 5 or 10 years.</li>
 	<li>You can also select a Tolerance (T) for observations shown in maps. This means that if for a variable there is no data for a specific year X the Grapher will automatically look in the following and preceding years to find the closest observation. The Grapher will then look for observations that are between X-T and X+T.</li>
 	<li>Select a color scheme. These color schemes are the ColorBrewer2 schemes and you can helpfully see all of these by clicking on the small blue (i) next to color scheme.
<ol>
 	<li>You can also increase the number of categories. Note that the color schemes differ in the number of categories.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>By default the data is automatically categorized but you can also do this yourself ‚Äì just click away the tick next to "Automatically classify data"</li>
 	<li>You can then add the bracket limits. The bracket limits have the limit smaller or equal &lt;= to the bracket limit.
<ol>
 	<li>You can also label the categories ‚Äì this is useful for maps that show categorical data (see below in the example section).</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>With the legend
<ol>
 	<li>you can change the orientation ‚Äì use portrait for long numbers or words so that they don't overlap</li>
 	<li>give the legend a title</li>
 	<li>The square size should be increased if otherwise the labels of the legend overlap.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>That's it. Go to to the export tab and copy the line of html code and embed your chart in your article.</li>
</ol>

<h3>B3 List of possible visualizations</h3>
The Our World In Data Grapher is using the library NVD3.js and all examples of charts (and their names) are listed there <a href="http://nvd3.org/examples/index.html">http://nvd3.org/examples/index.html</a>.
<h4>3.1 Line Chart</h4>
&nbsp;

<strong>3.1.1 Simple line chart</strong>

Click on add country to show a different country. Click on a shown country to remove it from the chart.

<strong>How to create this chart:</strong> This is described above in a step-by-step guide.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 700px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/58" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>3.1.2 Line chart with more than one variable associated with one country</strong>

In the example below adding or removing a country always adds and removes observations for men <em>and</em> women.

<strong>How to create this chart: </strong>

To do this chart pick "line chart" as the type of chart. In the data tab select female suicide rates and drag-and-drop it to the y-axis; then select male suicide rates and also drag-and-drop it to the y-axis. Done. (By the way, this also works for two unrelated variables like GDP and suicide rates, but they will be shown on the same y-axis which does not make sense.)
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/41" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

&nbsp;
<h4>3.2 Stacked area chart</h4>
<strong>3.2.1 Stacked Area Chart</strong>

This chart is useful if observations in a specific year sum up to a meaningful total.

<strong>How to create this chart:</strong>

On the first tab select Stacked Area Chart.

For this type of chart there are two distinct options: 1) stacking up the same measures for several countries or 2) stacking up several measures for the same country.
<ul>
 	<li>You select this option on the second tab ‚Äì Data: Default is option 1; if you want to stack up several measures for the same country instead, chose the option 'Group by variables' in option D and select 'User can change country' in option F.</li>
</ul>
Now add the variables to the Y-axis. Done.
<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-malaria-deaths-by-world-region" style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

<strong>3.2.2 Stacked Area with Change Country function</strong> ‚Äì Population breakdown by education

You can click on <em>Change Country</em> to see the data for a different country.

<strong>How to create this chart:</strong>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/79" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>3.4 Bar chart</h4>
(horizontal and vertical; single- and multi-bar charts)

<strong>3.4.1 Stacked/Grouped Multi-Bar Chart</strong>
This is a bar chart for time series information
Example shows war deaths ‚Äì you can "group" or "stack" the data by year by choosing one or the other option on the top left.

<strong>How to create this chart:</strong>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/104" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>3.4.3 Discrete Bar Chart</strong>

<strong>How to create this chart:</strong>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/122" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>3.4 Scatter plot</h4>
<strong>How to create this chart:</strong>

Most of the options are described in the above section that explains how to create a line chart. Here only the differences between making a scatter plot and a line chart are explained ‚Äì these are the settings in the Data Tab:

In the data panel you can select a variable (in the 'Add variable' box) and then drag-and-drop it to the x-axis, select a new variable and drag-and-drop it to the y-axis, and select a variable to drag-and-drop to the size (commonly this is the population of the country).

The year for which the scatter plot should show the data can be defined on the same panel in a menu that is accessible through the <em>cogwheel</em>. The menu accessible through the cogwheel is key for this chart ‚Äì but admittedly it is not obvious to find.

The menu looks like this:

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-22.20.18.png" rel="attachment wp-att-6950"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6950 size-medium" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_screen-shot-2016-02-10-at-22.20.18-400x163.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-10 at 22.20.18" width="400" height="163" /></a>

You can either "Display values for single year" or "Display values for entire period". For the first option you of course can specify the single year for which the scatter plot should be done. In the second option observations for each year will be matched.

In both options you can select a Tolerance (T) ‚Äì this means that if for a variable there is no data for a specific year X the Grapher will automatically look in the following and preceding years to find the closest observation. The Grapher will then look for observations that are between X-T and X+T.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/71" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>3.5 Choropleth World Maps</h4>
(world maps and maps of all countries and continents)

<strong>How to create this chart:</strong>

Similar to maps you can select a Tolerance (T) for observations shown in maps. This means that if for a variable there is no data for a specific year X the Grapher will automatically look in the following and preceding years to find the closest observation. The Grapher will then look for observations that are between X-T and X+T.

&nbsp;

<strong>3.5.1 World maps with numerical (ratio) data</strong>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/148" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>3.5.2 Political Regime Map ‚Äì World map with categorical data that is coded as numerical data and then displayed with category names</strong>

<h3>Global Convergence of the Human Development Index</h3>
The following graph shows that there is strong convergence between countries of the world. Those countries that had the lowest HDI in 1980 experienced generally the largest improvements over the following 33 years! This is not only due to some components of the HDI having an upper bound (like literacy rate); there has also been convergence in aspects that have no upper bound like income (<a title="Inequality between World Citizens" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/inequality-between-world-citizens/">Our World in Data entry on the World Income Distribution</a>) and life expectancy (<a title="Life Expectancy" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/">Our World in Data entry on Life Expectancy</a>).

<p class="p1">The protection of human rights is certainly¬†one of the most important aspects of development. Unfortunately it¬†receives¬†much less attention than other aspects, presumably also because it is so very hard to measure.:¬†If one is interested in empirically studying the protection of human rights it is not enough to count countries that ratify human rights treaties. Instead¬†the quantitative study of human rights¬†aims to¬†capture whether or not certain human rights are protected in practice.</p>

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Protection from political repression and violations of ‚Äúphysical integrity rights‚Äù</h3>
<strong>The problem ‚Äì ethically you want to increase the standards by which we assess human rights violations over time, but this poses a problem for measurement:</strong> One of the fundamental drivers ¬†to reach the¬†aim of protecting human rights is¬†the increasing¬†recognition of the many dimensions in which individual rights are violated. It is¬†therefore crucial to change¬†the standards of human rights protection if you want to improve¬†human rights protection.¬†From an ethical perspective it makes sense to raise the standards of human right protections if your aim is to abolish more and more¬†repressive practices by which governments abuse the human rights of their citizens.
<p class="p1">However, from a measurement perspective raising the standards by which we evaluate whether human rights are protected poses a problem.¬†This is because¬†changing the standards for what constitutes human rights violations makes it impossible to compare human rights protection over time.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The solution ‚Äì correct for changing standards¬†of accountability:</strong>¬†In a landmark paper ‚Äì Fariss (2014)[ref]Christopher J. Fariss (2014) ‚Äì Respect for Human Rights has Improved Over Time: Modeling the Changing Standard of Accountability. In American Political Science Review / Volume 108 / Issue 02 / May 2014, pp 297-318 DOI: <span class="s1">http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055414000070</span> (About DOI), Published online: 08 May 2014[/ref] ‚Äì the political scientist Christopher J. Fariss¬†investigated whether the standards by which human rights organizatios measure the protection of human rights have indeed changed over time.</p>
<p class="p1">Fariss‚Äô assessment¬†of the protection of human rights focusses on the protection of the physical integrity of citizens. He aims to measure¬†how a government protects the physical integrity takes into account¬†torture, government killing, political imprisonment, extrajudicial executions, mass killings and disappearances.</p>
<p class="p1">To correct for the bias introduced by changing standards in the measurement of human rights protection Fariss developed the 'dynamic standard model‚Äô. With this model he adjusts for the bias in measurements so that human right protection measurements can be compared over time. Fariss¬†uses available¬†quantitative information on human rights violations and then employs statistical¬†techniques¬†to correct for the changing¬†standards of human right protections.</p>
<p class="p1">His¬†empirical measures¬†of human right protection are presented in the visualisation below. You can move the slider underneath the map to see the change over time and by switching to the Chart view you can see his assessment of¬†human rights protection country by country over time.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>How to read this chart:</strong> Higher values ‚Äì higher human rights scores ‚Äì indicate better human rights protection.</p>
<p class="p1">The human rights scores¬†represent the relative position of one country¬†in one¬†year¬†relative¬†to the average across the entire time (1949-2014)¬†of all countries: This means, a zero score represents the average level of observed physical integrity abuses for the entire period (1949-2014). The human rights scores represent standard deviations above and below zero; as can be seen the worst and best country-years fall 2 to 3 standard deviations below or above the average.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The finding of the research:</strong> After¬†correcting for changing standards of human right measurement¬†Fariss concluded that globally¬†‚Äòphysical integrity practices have improved over time.‚Äô</p>
<p class="p1">This is an important finding as such, but it is particularly important also because it contradicts the unadjusted data from human right organizations, which have¬†indicated that there has been no trend of either improving or worsening human rights protection.¬†Fariss¬†found that¬†‚Äôthe pattern of constant abuse found in data derived from human rights reports is not an indication of stagnating human rights practices. Instead, it reflects a systematic change in the way monitoring agencies, like Amnesty International and the U.S. State Department, encounter and interpret information about human rights abuses.'</p>
<p class="p1">Fariss research findings¬†suggest that we saw no trend in human rights protection because at the same time¬†as human right protection improved we also raised the standards by which we measure human right protection.</p>

<h2>Correlates, Determinants, &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Prosperity is correlated with better human rights protection</h3>
The chart below plots the level of GDP per capita against the Human Rights Protection Score from Schnakenberg and Fariss. We see that¬†more prosperous countries tend to¬†protect human rights better.¬†Some¬†resource rich economies ‚Äì Saudi-Arabia, Kuwait, Equatorial-Guinea and others ‚Äì are outliers which are both rich and have low human rights protection scores. The countries with the lowest human rights protection scores are also poor economies.

Every year, 4.3 million people die due to the exposure to household air pollution caused by indoor open fire. To bring this in perspective: This is 45-times the number of the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/environmental-change/natural-catastrophes/#annual-global-number-of-deaths-from-natural-catastrophes-1900-2013-per-decade-max-roserref">global annual deaths from natural catastrophes (¬±95,000 in the 2010s)</a>.

It might be the most unreported of the world‚Äôs big problems.

It is predominantly women and young children who are killed by indoor air pollution.

The World Health Organization estimates that <em>"4.3 million people a year die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution caused by the inefficient use of solid fuels (2012 data)."</em>[ref]WHO (2014) ‚Äì Fact sheet N¬∞292 ‚Äì Household air pollution and health. Updated March 2014. Online <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/">here</a>.[/ref]

According to the WHO these deaths are attributable to the following diseases:
<ul>
	<li>12% are due to pneumonia</li>
	<li>34% from stroke</li>
	<li>26% from ischaemic heart disease</li>
	<li>22% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and</li>
	<li>6% from lung cancer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
The burning of solid fuels fills the houses and huts in poorer countries with smoke that kills the world‚Äôs poor by causing pneumonia, stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. The solid fuels responsible for this include wood, crop residues, dung, charcoal, and coal. The solution for this problem is straightforward: shift from solid fuels to modern energy sources.

And the following chart shows that the world is making progress in this direction. In 1980 almost two thirds of the world‚Äôs population used solid fuels for their cooking. 30 years later this is down to 41%. The chart also shows that it is a problem associated with poverty: In richer Europe and North America the share is much lower than in the rest of the world; and in the high income countries of the world the use of solid fuels is entirely a thing of the past.

The use of solid fuels is going down in all of the world‚Äôs regions. But the success rapidly developing South East Asia is particularly impressive: Here the share fell from 95% to 61%.

Notes by the original source:
1 Strong evidence: Many studies of solid fuel use in developing countries, supported by evidence from studies of active and passive smoking, urban air pollution and biochemical or laboratory studies.
Moderate evidence: At least three studies of solid fuel use in developing countries, supported by evidence from studies on active smoking and on animals.
Moderate I: strong evidence for specific age/sex groups.
Moderate II: limited evidence.

2 The relative risk indicates how many times more likely the disease is to occur in people exposed to indoor air pollution than in unexposed people.
<p style="text-align: left;">3 The confidence interval represents an uncertainty range. Wide intervals indicate lower precision; narrow intervals indicate greater precision.[/ref]

In this entry we begin by analyzing available data on historical trade patterns around the world, and then move on to discuss more recent data, outlining trade patterns from the last couple of decades. In the last section, we turn to analyze empirical evidence regarding the determinants and consequences of international trade.

From a historical perspective, international trade has grown remarkably in the last couple of centuries. After a long period characterized by persistently low international trade, over the course of the 19th century, technological advances triggered a period of marked growth in world trade (the 'first wave of globalisation'). This process of growth stopped, and was eventually reversed in the interwar period; but since the Second World War international trade started growing again, and in the last decades trade expansion has been faster than ever before. Today, the sum of exports and imports across nations is higher than 50% of global production. At the turn of the 19th century this figure was below 10%.

In the last couple of decades, transport and communication costs have decreased across the world, and preferential trade agreements have become more and more common, particularly among developing countries. In fact, trade among developing nations (often referred to as South‚ÄìSouth trade), more than tripled in the period 1980‚Äì2011.

Free international trade is often seen as desirable because it allows countries to specialize, so that they produce goods that they are relatively efficient at producing, and import other goods. This is the essence of the comparative advantage argument supporting gains from trade: exchange allows countries to ‚Äúdo what they do best, and import the rest‚Äù.

Available empirical evidence shows that while trade does lead to economic growth on the aggregate, it also creates ‚Äòwinners and losers‚Äô within countries ‚Äì so it is important to consider the distributional consequences of trade liberalization.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>International trade in the long run</h3>
<h4>International trade has grown remarkably in the last couple of centuries</h4>
The following visualization presents a compilation of available trade estimates, showing the evolution of world exports and imports as a share of world output (you can read more about aggregate output measures in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">GDP</a>).

As we can see, until 1800 there was a long period characterized by persistently low international trade ‚Äì globally the sum of exports and imports never exceeded 10% before 1800. This then changed over the course of the 19th century, when technological advances triggered a period of marked growth in world trade ‚Äì the so-called 'first wave of globalization'. Until 1913, worldwide trade grew by more than 3% annually.

The first wave of globalization came to an end with the beginning of the First World War, when the decline of liberalism and the rise of nationalism led to a slump in international trade. In the chart we see that there was a sizeable reduction on international trade in the interwar period.

After the Second World War trade started growing again. This new ‚Äì and ongoing ‚Äì wave of globalization has seen international trade grow faster than ever before. Today the sum of exports and imports across nations is higher than 50% of global production.

Notes on the calculation of the lower and upper bound estimates from the authors: <em>"1500‚Äì1800: Trade growth rates from O‚ÄôRourke and Williamson [2002, Table 1; volume estimates only]. Level index derived, and scaled by world GDP levels from Maddison [2001, Table B-18]. The ‚Äúupper bound‚Äù series is then scaled to the benchmark 8 percent European trade-GDP ratio for 1780 due to O‚ÄôBrien [1982], probably an overstatement of the world trade-GDP ratio. The ‚Äúlower bound‚Äù series is scaled to the benchmark 2 percent world trade-GDP ratio for 1820 due to Maddison [1995, Table 2-4], possibly biased downwards relative to the long-run trend because of the blockades during the Napoleonic Wars."</em>[/ref]

Throughout the last two centuries, the rate of growth increased constantly ‚Äì trade grew faster and faster. This remark can be best appreciated in the following visualization, presenting estimates of world exports for the period 1800-2014. The data comes from Federico and Tena-Junguito (2016)[ref]Federico, Giovanni and Antonio Tena-Junguito (2016). 'A tale of two globalizations: gains from trade and openness 1800-2010'. London, Centre for Economic Policy Research. (CEPR WP.11128).[/ref] and the vertical axis is in constant prices (i.e. world exports have been indexed, so that values are relative to the value of exports in the year 1913). As it can be seen, trade growth roughly followed an exponential path in the period 1800-2010. In fact, growth in exports has been so large in the last century that the interwar slump is almost not visible when we use this scale.

<h4>Before the 19th century trade was strongly linked to colonialism</h4>
Over the early modern period, transoceanic flows of goods between empires and colonies accounted for an important part of international trade. The following visualizations provides a comparison of intercontinental trade, in per capita terms, for different countries.

As we can see, intercontinental trade was very dynamic, with volumes varying considerably across time and from empire to empire.

<h4>Trade within Europe was very important in the 'first wave of globalization'</h4>
The following visualization provides details regarding trade patterns for specific countries during the first wave of globalization. It shows the most common measure of international integration: trade openness, measured as the sum of exports and imports, expressed as a share of GDP.

The data shows that over the course of the 19th century, international trade became increasingly important across many nations. Yet we can also see that in some countries, trade was already very important before the 19th century. The Netherlands is a case in point: the so-called Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century stands out exceptionally in the graph.

By comparing the series labelled 'Europe (total)' and 'Europe (total) without intra-Europe trade', we can also see that the 'first wave of globalization' implied a substantial growth in trade <em>within</em> Europe.

<h4>European integration collapsed in the interwar period</h4>
In the previous visualization we highlighted the important process of economic integration that took place in Europe during the 19th century. Here we focus on the impact that the First and Second World Wars had on this process.

The following graph shows exports and imports as a share of GDP for a selection of European countries, during the period 1815-1949. As can be seen, economic integration collapsed across European countries in the interwar period.

<h3>The 'second wave of globalization'</h3>
<h4>The second half of the 20th century saw increasing trade across the world</h4>
We have already pointed out that after the Second World War, global trade openness started growing even faster than before the First World War. Here we show, country by country, how trade has been expanding across the globe in the last few decades.

The visualization below presents a world map of trade openness. It shows the sum of a country's exports and imports, divided by that country's GDP. You can explore country-specific time series by clicking on the 'Chart' option on top of the map. As can be seen, trade has changed over time differently in each country, but in the vast majority of countries there is a marked upward trend.

<h4>Reductions in trading costs have contributed to the recent expansion of trade</h4>
The world-wide expansion of trade after the Second World War was largely possible because of reductions in transaction costs stemming from technological advances, such as the development of commercial civil aviation, the improvement of productivity in the merchant marine, and the democratisation of the telephone as the main mode of communication. The visualization below shows how, at the global level, costs across these three variables have been going down since 1930.

<h4>The 'second wave of globalization' has been characterized by increasing intra-industry trade</h4>
The 'first wave of globalization' was characterized by inter-industry trade. This means that countries exported goods that were very different to what they imported ‚Äì England exchanged machines for Australian wool and Indian tea. This changed in the 'second wave of globalization'. Intra-industry trade (i.e. the exchange of broadly similar goods and services) has increased substantially since the Second World War ‚Äì France now both imports and exports cars to and from Germany.

The following visualization, from the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/477365-1327525347307/8392086-1327528510568/WDR09_12_Ch06web.pdf">UN World Development Report (2009)</a>, plots the fraction of total world trade that is accounted for by intra-industry trade, by type of goods. As we can see, intra-industry trade has been going up for primary, intermediate and final goods.

This pattern of trade is important because the scope for specialisation increases if countries are able to exchange intermediate goods (e.g. auto parts) for related final goods (e.g. cars).
<h6>Share of intraindustry trade by type of goods ‚Äì Figure 6.1 in <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/477365-1327525347307/8392086-1327528510568/WDR09_12_Ch06web.pdf">UN World Development Report (2009)</a></h6>

<h4>What is traded around the world?</h4>
The <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/">Observatory for Economic Complexity (OEC)</a>, at the MIT, produces fascinating interactive visualizations of international trade patterns. The following chart shows a breakdown of world exports by product, since the 1960s. You can visit the OEC website for an <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/03l9gb">interactive version of this chart</a>, including figures in absolute terms (exports and imports by products in current US dollars).

In the figure below, we can see that oil, machinery and electronics, have been traditionally large trading sectors since the 1960s. However, electronics have grown particularly fast, while the importance of oil has declined. Today, electronics account for a larger share of world exports, and are only second to machinery.

<h3>Recent developments in bilateral and regional trade</h3>
<h4>Bilateral trade is more frequent than unilateral trade</h4>
Most countries that export goods to a country, also import goods from the same country. The following visualization, from Helpman et al. (2007)[ref]Helpman, E., Melitz, M., &amp; Rubinstein, Y. (2007). Estimating trade flows: Trading partners and trading volumes (No. w12927). National Bureau of Economic Research.[/ref] provides evidence of this. In this figure, all possible country pairs are partitioned into three categories: the top portion represents the fraction of country pairs that do not trade with one-another; the bottom portion represents those that trade in both directions (they export to one-another); and the middle portion represents those that trade in one direction only (one country imports from, but does not export to, the other country). As we can see, the majority of trading relationships are bilateral.

Another important conclusion from the figure below is that growth in international trade throughout the second half of the 20th century took place specifically through growth in bilateral exchanges. Nevertheless, today there are still many countries that do not trade with each other.
<h6>Distribution of country pairs by type of trade (bilateral, unilateral, or non-trading), 158 countries, 1970-1997 ‚Äì Figure 1 in Helpman et al.

<h4>South-South trade is becoming increasingly important</h4>
The following visualization, from the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/14/hdr2013_en_complete.pdf">UN Human Development Report (2013)</a>, shows the share of world merchandise trade that corresponds to exchanges between emerging and advanced economies. Specifically, this chart plot series for South-South trade (i.e. trade between emerging economies), South-North trade (i.e. trade between advances and emerging economies) and North-North trade (i.e. trade between advanced economies). For the purpose of this graph, the 'North' corresponds to Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and Western Europe.

This figure shows that, as a share of world merchandise trade, South‚ÄìSouth trade more than tripled over 1980‚Äì2011, while North‚ÄìNorth trade declined. China has been a key driver of this dynamic: the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/14/hdr2013_en_complete.pdf">UN Human Development Report (2013)</a> estimates that between 1992 and 2011, China's trade with Sub-Saharan Africa rose from $1 billion to more than $140 billion.

<h4>The majority of preferential trade agreements are between emerging economies</h4>
The last few decades have not only seen an increase in the volume of international trade, but also an increase in the number of preferential trade agreements though which exchanges take place. A preferential trade agreement is a trade pact that reduces tariffs between the participating countries for certain products.

The following visualization shows the evolution of the cumulative number of preferential trade agreements that are in force across the world, according to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). These numbers include notified and non-notified preferential agreements (the source reports that only about two-thirds of the agreements currently in force have been notified to the WTO), and are disaggregated by country groups.

This figure shows the increasingly important role of trade between developing countries (South-South trade), vis-a-vis trade between developed and developing countries (North-South trade). In the late 1970s, North-South agreements accounted for more than half of all agreements ‚Äì in 2010, they accounted for about one quarter. Today, the majority of preferential trade agreements are between emerging economies.

<h4>Trading patterns have been changing quickly in middle income countries</h4>
The increase in trade among emerging economies over the last half century has been accompanied by an important change in the composition of exported goods in these countries. To provide a concrete example of this, the following visualization plots the share of food exports in each country's total exported merchandise. These figures, produced by the World Bank, correspond to the Standard International Trade Classification, in which 'food' includes, among other, live animals, beverages, tobacco, coffee, oils and fats.

Two important patterns emerge from the data. First, there has bee a substantial decrease in the relative importance of food exports since 1960s in most countries (although in the last decade it has gone up slightly globally). And second, this decrease has been largest in middle income countries, particularly in Latin America. Colombia is a notable case in point: food went from 67% of merchandise exports in 1986, to 11% in 2015.

Regarding levels, as one would expect, in high income countries food still accounts for a much smaller share of exports than in most developing countries.
<h2>Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</h2>
<h3>Explaining trade patterns</h3>
<h4>Countries tend to export what would be cheap to produce under autarky</h4>
Most trade theories in the economics literature focus on sources of comparative advantage. Broadly speaking, the principle of comparative advantage postulates that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, and import the rest: ‚Äúdo what you do best, import the rest‚Äù.

For countries with relative abundance of certain factors of production, the theory thus predicts that they will export goods that rely heavily in those factors: a country typically has a comparative advantage in those goods that use more intensively its abundant resources. Under this theory, Colombia exports bananas to Europe because it has comparatively abundant tropical weather. Under autarky, Colombia would find it cheap to produce bananas relative to e.g. apples.

The empirical evidence suggests that the principle of comparative advantage does help explain trade patterns. Bernhofen and Brown (2004)[ref]Bernhofen, D., &amp; Brown, J. (2004). A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan. Journal of Political Economy, 112(1), 48-67. doi:1. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/379944 doi:1[/ref], for instance, provide evidence using the experience of Japan. Specifically, they exploit Japan‚Äôs dramatic nineteenth-century move from a state of near complete isolation to wide trade openness.

The following graph shows the price changes of the key tradable goods after the opening up to trade. It presents a scatter diagram of the net exports in 1869 graphed in relation to the change in prices from 1851‚Äì53 to 1869. As we can see, this is consistent with the theory: after opening to trade, the relative prices of major exports such as silk increased (Japan exported what was cheap for them to produce and which was valuable abroad), while the relative price of imports such as sugar declined (they imported what was relatively more difficult for them to produce, but was cheap abroad).

<h4>Financial institutions affect trade</h4>
Conducting international trade requires that producers in exporting countries have access to external capital, such as credit.
The following scatter plot, from Manova (2013)[ref]Manova, Kalina. "Credit constraints, heterogeneous firms, and international trade." The Review of Economic Studies 80.2 (2013): 711-744.[/ref] shows the correlation between levels in private credit (specifically exporters‚Äô private credit as a share of GDP) and exports (average log bilateral exports across destinations and sectors). As can be seen, financially developed economies ‚Äì those with more dynamic private credit markets ‚Äì typically outperform exporters with less evolved financial institutions.

Other academic research has shown that non-economic institutions are also important determinants of trade. Country-specific language knowledge for example, has been shown to promote foreign relative to domestic trade (see Melitz 2008[ref]Melitz, J. (2008). Language and foreign trade. European Economic Review, 52(4), 667-699.[/ref]).

<h4>Trade diminishes dramatically with distance</h4>
The resistance that geography imposes on trade has long been studied in the empirical economics literature, typically under the lable of 'gravity trade models'. The main conclusion in this literature is that trade intensity is strongly linked to geographic distance.

The following visualization, from Eaton and Kortum (2002)[ref]Eaton, J., &amp; Kortum, S. (2002). Technology, geography, and trade. Econometrica, 70(5), 1741-1779.[/ref], graphs 'normalized import shares' against distance. Each dot represents a country-pair from a set of 19 OECD countries, and both the vertical and horizontal axis are expressed on logarithmic scales (1995 data). The 'normalized import shares' in the vertical axis provide a measure of how much each country imports from different partners (see the paper for details on how this is calculated and normalised), while distance in the horizontal axis corresponds to separation between central cities in each country (see the paper and references therein for details on the list of cities). As we can see, there is a strong negative relationship. Through econometric modelling, the paper shows that this relationship is not just a correlation driven by other factors: their findings suggest that distance still imposes a significant cost on trade.
<h6>Import share versus distance, country pairs for a set of 19 OECD countries, 1990 ‚Äì Figure 1 in Eaton and Kortum (2002)[ref]Eaton, J., &amp; Kortum, S. (2002). Technology, geography, and trade. Econometrica, 70(5), 1741-1779.[/ref]</h6>

The fact that trade diminishes with distance is also corroborated by data of trade intensity within countries. The following visualization shows, through a series of maps, the geographic distribution of French firms that export to France's neighboring countries. The colors reflect the percentage of firms which export to each specific country. As we can see, the share of firms exporting to each of the corresponding neighbors is largest close to the border. The authors also show in the paper that this pattern holds for the value of individual-firm exports ‚Äì trade value decreases with distance to the border.

<h3>Trade and economic performance</h3>
<h4>How is trade related to economic growth?</h4>
A useful first step to establish whether trade and economic growth are somehow related is to search for correlations. The following figure, from Ventura (2006)[ref]Ventura, J. (2005). A global view of economic growth. Handbook of economic growth, 1, 1419-1497.[/ref], plots the growth rates of these two variables against each other, using pooled data from various regions and periods. Each dot in this plot corresponds to growth in a specific world region during a specific time period. There are in total seven regions (Western Europe, Western Offshoots, Eastern Europe and former USSR, Latin America, Asia and Africa) across four periods (1870‚Äì1913, 1913‚Äì1950, 1950‚Äì1973 and 1973‚Äì1998). As can be seen, there is a strong positive correlation between growth in per capita income and growth in trade.

This relationship is only a correlation, and does not imply causation ‚Äì countries differ in many aspects other than trade openness, and hence we cannot attribute the observed differences in growth to differences in trade. In other words, trade is 'endogenous': countries whose incomes are high for reasons other than trade, may trade more.

The academic economics literature has tried to address the issue of endogeneity in a number of ways. In a seminal paper, Frankel and Romer (1999) suggest using geography as a proxy for trade. The idea is that geography is fixed, and mainly affects national income through trade ‚Äì so if we observe that a country's distance from other countries is a powerful predictor of economic growth (after accounting for other characteristics), then it must be because <em>trade</em> has an effect on economic growth. Following this logic, the authors suggest that there is a strong positive causal effect of trade on economic growth. This, of course, does not prove that trade is the only driver of growth ‚Äì indeed, the related findings from Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi (2004)[ref]Rodrik, D., Subramanian, A., &amp; Trebbi, F. (2004). Institutions rule: the primacy of institutions over geography and integration in economic development. Journal of economic growth, 9(2), 131-165.[/ref], suggest that trade matters through its interaction with other institutions, like the rule of law. For more literature on this topic see Alcala and Ciccone 2004[ref]Alcal√°, F., Ciccone, A. (2004). ‚ÄúTrade and productivity‚Äù. Quarterly Journal of Economics 119 (2), 613‚Äì646.[/ref] and the references therein.

<h4>How does trade affect the distribution of incomes?</h4>
A core prediction of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade-new-draft/#countries-tend-to-export-what-would-be-cheap-to-produce-under-autarky">the above-mentioned 'comparative advantage' theories of trade</a> is that, through liberalization and economic integration, the relative prices of goods will change. In its simplest form, the prediction is that countries that open up to trade will see the relative prices of some goods go up, while others will go down. It is clear, then, that even such simple and stylized prediction implies that trade creates winners and losers, depending on what different people produce and consume, and what factors of production they can contribute to the economy.

A growing empirical literature in economics has tried to address the question of whether trade liberalization helps specifically the incomes of those at the bottom of the distribution. Topalova (2010) finds that the 1991 Indian trade liberalization, had a negative effect on poverty reductions: rural districts in which production sectors were more exposed to liberalization, experienced slower decline in poverty and lower consumption growth. The author provides evidence suggesting that the reason for this was the fact that those who were worse off struggled to relocate to other sectors, in order to reap the benefits from trade. Here again we see how trade interacts with region-specific characteristics that determine the consequence of trade.

Other studies, using data from other countries, have also found that trade may have important distributional consequences. Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013)[ref]David, H., Dorn, D., &amp; Hanson, G. H. (2013). The China syndrome: Local labor market effects of import competition in the United States. The American Economic Review, 103(6), 2121-2168.[/ref], for example, study the consequences for the US of rising Chinese imports in the period 1990-2007. The visualization below shows a scatter plot of cross-regional exposure to rising imports, against changes in employment. Each dot on this graph corresponds to a different area within the US ('commuting zones', CZs); the vertical axis shows the percent change in manufacturing employment for working age population; and the horizontal axis shows what the authors predict to be the per-worker exposure of the different areas to rising imports (depending on industrial composition, etc.). As can be seen, there is a negative correlation. In fact, the authors go beyond, and suggest that rising Chinese imports in the period 1990-2007 <em>caused</em> higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries (see the paper for details on the empirical strategy used to determine causality).

While both of the studies mentioned above suggest a negative impact of trade on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/">income inequality</a>, they do not prove that e.g. India or the US were on the whole made worse-off because of trade. In fact, there are other studies, such as Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016)[ref]
Pablo D. Fajgelbaum and Amit K. Khandelwal (2016). Measuring the Unequal Gains from Trade. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, forthcoming. Published online March 14, 2016[/ref], that show that trade does favour specifically the poor. The aspect via which trade benefits the poor is consumption ‚Äì they find that the relative change in prices produced by trade typically favors the poor, who concentrate spending in more traded sectors. This is at the heart of the classic trade-off in public economics: efficiency sometimes comes at the cost of equity.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Growth of the Internet</h3>
The number of Internet users worldwide has skyrocketed since the birth of the World Wide Web in 1990. On the 20 December 1990, the world's first website and server went live at CERN. The first ever website was published by the Internet's creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, on 6 August 1991 and¬†in 1993 CERN made the World Wide Web available on a royalty free basis to the public domain. By 1993, there were 14 million Internet users worldwide and 130 websites.

Access to the Internet is almost universal in developed countries and although usage rates are much lower in the developing world, the trend is positive. The chart below shows that between 2004 and 2014 Sub-Saharan Africa saw a 1400% increase in internet users. While this increase is massive, user numbers still lag behind <em>East Asia &amp; Pacific</em> and <em>Europe and Central Asia</em>.

A very recent development is the use of internet enabled mobile devices including phones and tablet computers. The chart below shows the slow rise of Internet use on mobile devices in the late 1990s which gave way to the dramatic increase in use of Internet on mobile devices throughout the 2000s.

<h3>ARPNET: The Evolution of the Pre-Internet</h3>
Before the World Wide Web there was ARPANET, the first working packet switching network which allowed users to communicate with each other using their computers. ARPANET was a major advance in technology made by scientists in the Network Working Group (NWG). ARPANET was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which was formed by the government as a part research, part military agency. It is thought that the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957 sparked the U.S to form¬†ARPA. Dr J.C.R Licklider was one of the trailblazers in moving computers beyond the batch processing computer system and into systems of interactive digital communication (ARPANET). Licklider created Information Processing Techniques (IPT), an office he dedicated to researching advancement in computer technologies. Notable research outside of ARPA was led by Paul Baron and Thomas Marill. What follows is a brief timeline of the major developments to ARPNET:[ref]The data is taken from the following sources:
"History of ARPANET: Behind the Net - The untold history of the ARPANET Or - The "Open" History of the ARPANET/Internet" a working paper by Michael Hauben, available online <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/jbcoco/Arpa-Arpanet-Internet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

"Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet" by Michael Hauben and Ronda Hauben, April 1997, available online <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0818677066.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<ul>
	<li><strong>1967</strong>: ARPA called for protocol specifications to be decided for the Interface Message Processor (IMP), it was decided that the hosts (participants' computers) would be connected by AT&amp;T phone lines.</li>
	<li><strong>1968</strong>: The specifications for the IMP were finalised and ARPANET was given the green light and a several million dollar budget. BBN Technologies was given the contract to develop the ARPANET subnetwork. However, the communication protocol still was left to be developed, this task was opened up to the academic computer science community to work on.</li>
	<li><strong>1969</strong>: UCLA's Network Measurement Centre installed the first set of IMPs. The IMPs were also installed at Stanford, the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah.¬†On October 29th 1969 at 10:30pm UCLA graduate student Charles Kline typed 'LO' the first word into the system. He had been attempting to type "LOGIN" but the system went down, shortly after he was able to type the full word in and connect to a computer in the Stanford Research Institute 350 miles away. Although this was a significant step forward for computer technology, Larry Roberts from the University of Utah told NWG that they could do more. So NWG continued their research and came up with the Network Control Program (NCP) a host to host protocol designed to make, break and switch connects and to control traffic.</li>
	<li><strong>1971</strong>: NWG had over 100 members who gave feedback on the development through the system 'Request for Comments (RFC)'. This system allowed developers to make one sentence comments to question or suggest a change for the software. This informal, open network allowed democratic discussions amongst developers which was significant for a developing team at the time.</li>
	<li><strong>1972</strong>: The first email was sent by Ray Tomlinson from BBN Technologies.</li>
	<li><strong>1973</strong>: University College London and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway connect to ARPANET.</li>
	<li><strong>1987</strong>: The number of hosts on the ARPNET had exceeded 20,000.</li>
	<li><strong>1991</strong>: A year after Tim Berners-Lee developed HyperText Markup Language (HTML), CERN introduces the World Wide Web to the public marking the death of ARPANET.</li>

Many were concerned that the dawn of the Internet would widen the gap between developed and developing nations. The digital divide is a social theory conceived in the late 1990s about the disadvantages for those who do not have good access to the Internet compared to those who do. Many predicted the gap would exponentially widen, however, by looking at data on price, speed and availability of the Internet it seems the gap is closing. The concern remains that although the access divide is not so great that the content divide is widening due to controls put in place by certain governments.[ref]Warschauer, Mark. <em>Technology and social inclusion: Rethinking the digital divide</em>.

Broadband refers to wide bandwidth data transmission, which translates into faster internet connections. Before 2000, access to broadband was mainly limited to the most technologically developed economies, mostly in the far east -- Hong Kong and South Korea being notable examples. Since 2000, broadband has spread throughout the world. However, many countries still lack the resources and infrastructure to boost internet speeds. Moreover, the digital divide is most apparent when comparing worldwide download speeds. The fastest download speeds are seen in North America, Europe and Eastern Asia. With South America, Africa, the Middle East, Southern Asia having much slower download speeds. To put these numbers into perspective, Skype requires a download speed of 1.5mbps for video calls, Youtube will stream a video at 360p with a download speed of 0.5mbps and you can watch Netflix with a download speed of 1.5mbps.[ref]This data is taken from Ookla speed test online support forum available <a href="https://support.speedtest.net/hc/en-us/articles/203845210-What-speeds-do-I-need-for-Skype-Netflix-video-games-etc-" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

<h3>Breakdown of Internet Users</h3>
In 1996 the typical internet user was a white male with a college degree, midway through their career. At this point the internet was not yet commercialised and the only websites available were basic email and news websites. Although women were in the minority they used the internet to connect with each other. An electronic mailing list called Systers began in 1987 and connected technical women in computing. A quote from Kramarae and Taylor (1992) suggests society's attitude about what use those other than white men may have had for the internet at this time, "<em>women and other marginalized people</em> use the internet to connect with <em>kindred souls</em>."[ref]"Adapting the internet" by Debra Winter and Chuck Huff of St. Olaf College, Available online <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/info/Papers/Winter.Huff.1996.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

In 2014 the gender gap has almost been bridged with women making up almost half of all internet users. Those with degrees still outweigh those without but there has been a rapid increase in internet users of all education levels. This is likely due to how easy to use, widespread and affordable the internet has become. Those aged over 65 remain in the minority of users due to their unfamiliarity with technology and its advancements.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants, &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>The Internet's Contribution to GDP</h3>
In 1987 the economist Robert Solow famously proclaimed: "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." This caused many policy makers and economists to analyse the supposed 'productivity paradox'. In <em>Beyond the Productivity Paradox:¬†Computers are the Catalyst for Bigger Changes</em> written in 1998, Erik Brynjolfsson questioned to what extent computers increased productivity. He found that computers do increase productivity when staff using the computers are trained effectively. Brynjolfsson notes that the businesses which adequately trained their staff in using the new technology saw much greater returns than those that neglected to do so.[ref]"Beyond the Productivity Paradox:¬†Computers are the Catalyst for Bigger Changes" written by Erik Brynjolfsson, June 1998 available online <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/bpp.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref]

Although this finding may seem obvious to us in today's world where computers are ubiquitous and have undoubtedly improved productivity, this was not obvious to those living in a world where computers were new. In all developed countries today, computers are an integral part of education at all levels and even very young children are using computers. It is estimated today that the internet contributes to GDP more than traditional sectors like agriculture, utilities, mining and education!

The Internet increases productivity by allowing market players to connect quickly and easily, this also increases information flows. Increasing information efficiency between markets is difficult to measure and is not included as in the Internet's contribution to GDP although it is an important factor. From 1995 to 2000¬†productivity increased from its long-term growth rate of 1.4% per year to an average of 2.6 percent per year - this increase is credited to companies investing in training staff to work with the new technologies, from 2001 to 2003 productivity increased to 3.6% per year, from 2004 to 2006 the productivity rate fell to 1.3% due to a decline in IT investments, from 2007 to 2008 productivity returned to 2.4%.[ref]Brynjolfsson, Erik, and Adam Saunders. "Wired for innovation: how information technology is reshaping the economy." (2010). Available online <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2344976" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] There is a very robust correlation across all countries between internet usage and measures of GDP. Countries with very high levels of internet usage tend to be the most developed.

<h4>The Benefit of the Internet on GDP in Developed Countries v. Undeveloped Countries</h4>
The McKinsey Global Institute's 2011 'Internet matters' report found that the Internet‚Äôs contribution to GDP growth had been significantly higher in the developed world.[ref]"Internet matters: The Net's sweeping impact on growth, jobs, and prosperity"¬†<span id="rightframe_1_AuthorPipe" class="pipe">by¬†</span><span id="rightframe_1_articleAuthors">Matthieu P√©lissi√© du Rausas, James Manyika, Eric Hazan, Jacques Bughin, Michael Chui, R√©mi Said for¬†McKinsey&amp;Company, found <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/internet_matters" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref]</span> There is around $450 billion added to global GDP growth each year by flows. However, the most connected countries receive 40% more of the benefit than the least connected. "Despite expectations that the Internet would enable emerging markets to participate as fully in global networks as developed economies do, emerging economies still lag behind in their broadband and digital infrastructure and quality and affordability of access. Therefore, they also trail in their production and consumption of valuable data and communication flows. In 2013, emerging markets accounted for only 24 percent of global online traffic, up from 10 percent in 2005 but still far below their share of Internet users. In per capita terms, the developed world‚Äôs lead is even larger. For example, per capita online traffic in Western Europe in 2013 was nearly 13 times that of online traffic in China and more than 20 times that of the Africa and Middle East region."[ref]Mckinsey (2014) - Global flows in a digital age: How trade, finance, people, and data connect the world economy, online <a href="http://www.mckinsey.de/sites/mck_files/files/140425_globalflows_full.pdf">here</a>.[/ref]

<h3>The Effects of the Internet on Education and Healthcare</h3>
In many ways the internet has transformed education at all levels. The ability for students to access learning materials online as well as for researchers to share findings and collaborate has revolutionised education. Where education used to be concentrated in universities or schools, it can now be accessed by billions of people (almost) anywhere in the world. This allows individuals in developing countries to learn independently and without the cost of tuition online. What is more, many leading research universities have begun making their course material online for anybody to access (<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>). Wikipedia has created the world's largest resource of information that is continuously updated and monitored by experts and dedicated enthusiasts. We can see that years of education is highly correlated with internet access from the graph below; note that this is likely to be driven by the fact that internet access and education are correlated with overall development. For more information on the effect of the internet on the international research community see our page <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/international-research-community/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/85" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Healthcare has also been transformed by the internet. It is now possible to receive advice and an online diagnosis from medical professionals through the internet. Apps are now being developed that can diagnose illnesses in developing countries where access to medical professionals is limited or expensive. One notable examples is the Portable Eye Examination Kit (Peek) that detects cataracts and can conduct eye tests. The app was trailed on 233 people in Kenya and found that the phone performed as well as eye charts, the results of which are published in the JAMA Ophthalmology. More information and a full list of relevant publications can be found on their website <a href="http://www.peekvision.org/" target="_blank">peekvision.org</a>.
<h3>The Effect of the Internet for Political Change</h3>
Technology helped to accelerate and organise the political revolution in Tunisia in 2010 which quickly across the entire Arab world during the Arab Spring. Activists in Tunisia used social media to raise awareness of police brutality through videos and photographs. These videos and photographs disproved the propaganda being broadcast through Tunisia's state media. This generated support in the affluent parts of the country where more people got involved through the use of social media - primarily Facebook- to organise. Of Tunisia's 10 million inhabitants only 2 million had access to Facebook and a mere 500 had access to Twitter, yet this was enough to spread awareness and ultimately bring down the ruling party.[ref]"How Social Media Accelerated Tunisia‚Äôs Revolution: An Inside View" by Colin Delany posted to <a href="http://www.epolitics.com/2011/02/10/how-social-media-accelerated-tunisias-revolution-an-inside-view/" target="_blank">Epolitics.com</a> and can also be found on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/colin-delany/how-social-media-accelera_b_821497.html" target="_blank">The Huffington Post</a>[/ref] The videos showing the violence and horror which were uploaded to Facebook were picked up first in the Netherlands before eventually being transmitted worldwide.

Many countries, including China, Thailand and Iran, have cut off access to news and social media sites during times of political unrest. However, when the Egyptian government shut off access to the internet - not just blocking individual sites but shutting down internet service providers (ISPs) - it unprecedented in the history of the internet. The graph below shows how internet activity all but disappeared after the shutdown.[ref]Source: <a href="http://www.arbornetworks.com/corporate/about-us" target="_blank">Arbor Networks</a> via Danny O'brien's article "Watching Egypt Disappear from the Internet" posted to the Committee to Protect Journalists, found <a href="https://cpj.org/blog/2011/01/watching-egypt-disappear-from-the-internet.php" target="_blank">here</a> Also can be found on The Huffington Post Tech in the article "Graph Visualizes Egypt's Internet Blackout" by Catharine Smith, found <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/28/this-is-what-egypts-cutoff-from-the-net-looks-like_n_815335.html" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref] During the five days that the Egyptian government closed the Internet Hackers from all around the world helped Egyptians connect with one another through basic mobile set ups using mesh networking.[ref]Hackers' Egypt Rescue: Get Protestors Back Online, read more¬†<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/hackers-egypt-rescue-get-protesters-back-online-68643" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref]

Inspired by the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, the 'Occupy Wall Street' movement was born out of the peoples' frustration with the "corrosive influence of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process, and the role of Wall Street in creating an economic collapse that has caused the greatest recession in generations."[ref]Occupy Wall Street, found <a href="http://occupywallst.org/about/" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref] Their slogan "we are the 99%" references the severe income inequality in the US. The initial protest was advertised through a blog post proposing the movements' followers occupy Wall Street peacefully. A Facebook page was created for the movement and featured videos of the protests. The movement relied heavily on social media and online messaging to communicate and publicise between the ranks. Protesters created an 'information area' which contained laptops and wireless routers on which they ran unofficial websites, live streams and Skype calls for other protesters.

The world map below shows how much freedom users have on the Internet within their country. Freedom on the Internet means the government does not control, block or monitor online content. Citizens of countries where the Internet is not free or partially free risk arrest for many types of online expression as their governments fear and oppose the open nature of the Internet.

<h3>The Internet's Influence on Job Creation</h3>
While technology has destroyed jobs in many old industries, rising employment demonstrates its ability to also create new jobs. Examples of entirely new, online-only jobs can be found in Youtube channels and online blogs. More than a million advertisers use Google ad platforms and top Youtube Creators were found to be more popular than mainstream celebrities among US teenagers. Partner revenue is over 50% and more than a million Youtube channels in dozens of countries are earning revenue from the Youtube Partner Programme with thousands of channels making 6 figures per year.[ref] Statistics -Youtube available online <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/en-GB/statistics.html" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

In 2013, the Airbnb community generated¬†US$824 million in economic activity¬†in the UK and supported¬†11,600 jobs.The study found that Airbnb generated¬†$175 million in economic activity in Barcelona in one year alone and supported¬†more than 4,000 jobs.[ref]Airbnb Economic Impact. Available online <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/economic-impact" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] Similar examples can be found in Uber, which through the internet has revolutionsed the taxi business worldwide.
<h3>Pornography: The Internet's Quiet Catalyst?</h3>
Internet pornography is¬†credited by many for creating a demand for higher bandwidth, for commercialising the Internet in 1990, for developing technologies to stream video online in 1994, for creating the webcam in 1996 and for creating subtitles and closed captioning for the hearing impaired.[ref]This data is taken from the article "Ten indispensable technologies built by the pornography industry" by Paul Rudo for Enterprise Features (2011)¬†found <a href="http://www.enterprisefeatures.com/ten-indispensable-technologies-built-by-the-pornography-industry/" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref] Nowadays, although it is difficult to find exact statistics due to the nature of the industry, Internet pornography is estimated to take up around 30% of Internet traffic. Internet pornography is also known to have commercialised the Internet and still takes over $1 billion.[ref]This data is taken from the article "In the tech world, porn quietly leads the way" by Doug Gross for CNN found¬†<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/23/porn.technology/" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref] As the mainstream market takes over the Internet porn makes up a smaller slice of Internet content. Barss estimates around 80% of modern technologies we owe to pornography.[ref]This data is taken from an interview with Patchen Barss "Porn industry, the Internet innovation engine we (prefer to)¬†ignore"¬†on his research for his book "The Erotic Engine" found¬†<a href="http://thewebobserver.it/2013/06/04/porn-industry-the-internet-innovation-engine-we-prefer-to-ignore/" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref]

Pornography is illegal in many countries, primarily China, the Middle East and Northern Africa. The People's Republic of China banned pornography in 1949 under a law condemning anything that¬†"violat[es] public morality and harm[s] the physical and mental health of youth and young people."[ref]Read more on China boycotting pornography on China daily, "Chinese portal calls for pornography boycott" by Xinhua available online <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-01/06/content_7372355.htm" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref] Pornography is prohibited in Islamic countries. In the past India has attempted to ban pornography but with little success for a number of reasons including India's history of celebrating sex.[ref] Read more about India's battle against pornography in the article "How India tried to ban porn and failed" by A.R for the Economist, available online <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-2" target="_blank">here</a>[/ref] Liberal Iceland has strict laws against pornography because it goes against the feminist values of the country.

The map below shows the pornography consumption in the United States.¬†Unsurprisingly, liberal states Nevada, Illinois and Massachusetts have some of the highest rates of porn consumption and more conservative states like Montana, Wyoming and and Idaho have relatively low rates of porn consumption. Although pornography has negative stigma particularly among religious groups, the conservative evangelical Protestant south eastern and south central states, nicknamed the "Bible Belt", do not have as a low a porn consumption as might be expected.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
Several papers have recently shown that light density at night reflects well standards of living. Both across geographic regions and across time. Some of these papers are:

Striking is the difference between North and South Korea by night shown in the satellite image below. It illustrates the point about the correlation between night time light and living conditions in terms of health, food provision, and poverty.

<h3>Change of night light over time to measure poverty</h3>
As a country develops the luxury of having light at night becomes available to more and more people. This simple fact was used by Maxim Pinkovskiy and Xavier Sala-i-Martin to study how poverty levels changed by studying how nighttime light ‚Äì visible in satellite images ‚Äì changed over time. The comparison of South Asia in 1994 and 2010 is taken from their study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2016.[ref]Maxim Pinkovskiy and Xavier Sala-i-Martin (2016) ‚Äì Lights, Camera ‚Ä¶ Income!

In times of peace, few countries spend more than 5% of GDP on their military, choosing instead to maintain their capabilities and make use of their armies in other ways. 

<h2>Empirical View</h2>

<h3>Historical Perspective</h3>

There are two ways in which we might want to measure military spending; the first way is spending in real terms and the second is as a percentage of GDP. Military expenditure in real terms is important since the absolute level of expenditure matters for the outcome of war. The US spending 10% of its GDP fighting a war is likely to defeat a low or middle income country spending 50% or more of its GDP. Yet, military expenditure as a percentage of GDP allows us to get a handle on the priorities and ambitions of a country.

The military expenditure of a country is largely determined by the whether it is at war or not. Outside of wartime, countries continue to spend substantial sums on maintaining their military capability. Below are two time series plots of military expenditure in real terms; the first is in thousands of 1900 UK pounds for the period 1830-1913, the second is in thousands of 2000 US dollars for the period 1914-2007.

<iframe src="http://ourworldindata.org/chart-builder/public/view/103" style="width:100%;height:660px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

The extent to which war influences military spending is demonstrated in the visualisation below. The UK's military spending as a percentage of GDP in peacetime fluctuates around 2.5%, in times of war however, military spending rises dramatically. At the height of the Second World War, the UK was spending around 53% of its GDP on its military. Such a dramatic rise is consistent with the existential danger faced by the UK during the Second World War.

<h3>Military Expenditure Today and in the Future</h3>

The following visualisations provide a snapshot of military expenditure in the world today and into the future. World military expenditure in 2014 was dominated by the United States, with the top 5 completed by China, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Kingdom. Projections of Military expenditure in 2045 suggest that while the US will continue to be the largest spender, nevertheless China is expected to close the gap considerably.

The following map displays military expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Military spending is particularly high in the Middle East, a region that has experienced dozens of conflicts since the Second World War. Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen all have very high levels of military expenditure relative to GDP and are all either currently engaged in conflict or have been in recent years. Two other countries that rank highly are Eritrea and North Korea, both of which are in perpetual conflicts with their neighbours Ethiopia and South Korea, respectively. It is estimated that North Korea spends roughly one-third of their national income on defence.[ref]"North Korea spends about a third of income on military." Reuters (2011).

The first nuclear weapons were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The devastating power of the bombs dropped on Japan forced the surrender of the Japanese and brought forward the end of the Second World War. Since then, controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons has been an important issue in international relations. This section details the continued development of nuclear technology, the number of warheads and the increase in the number of countries with nuclear capabilities.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>

<h3>Nuclear Attacks and Tests</h3>

There are two common ways of understanding the development of nuclear weapons and the arms race that took place between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The first is to look at the stockpiles of nuclear weapons each superpower built up. The total number of nuclear weapons in the world peaked in 1986. It is also worth remembering that the destructive power of each nuclear warhead has increased significantly since the first atomic weapons used in the Second World War. What is more, the number of states with confirmed nuclear capabilities now includes the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea.[ref]Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons but maintains a policy of nuclear ambiguity.[/ref]

If we consider the number of nuclear weapons tests, we can see that the Cold War was a very active period of nuclear weapons development. Although nuclear weapons were only ever used in warfare during the Second World War, there have been over 2000 nuclear weapons tests since then. Most recently North Korea conducted nuclear weapons tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

<h3>Nuclear Powers</h3>

It is a common misconception that more and more nations are exploring and developing nuclear weapons since the Second World War. As the following graph demonstrates, this is not completely true. There have been peaks in nuclear weapon development in the past few decades. By the late 1980s, the number of nations developing nuclear weapons¬†started falling and has remained steady since the mid-1990s. The names in the graph below represent nations developing weapons, and countries marked with "-" represent the year in which development in that country ceased.

<h2>Data Quality & Definitions</h2>

Obtaining an accurate count of the nuclear warheads possessed by each country today is difficult, if not impossible. Each country controls the publically available information relating to its nuclear capabilities for security reasons. The data presented here is taken from the <em>Federation of American Scientists Nuclear Notebook</em> and should be taken as a best-estimate of the capabilities of each country. In addition to this, Israel maintains a policy of nuclear ambiguity and refuses to confirm or deny its nuclear capabilities.

The data on nuclear weapons tests come from the Oklohoma Geological Survey and can be considered an accurate count of nuclear weapons tests.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>International Peacekeeping Operations</h3>

Since the UN does not have its own military it relies on contributions from member states. The role of these peacekeeping forces is not to engage in combat but to prevent future conflict and support stabilisation and rebuilding efforts. The mandate of the early peacekeeping operations ‚Äúwas primarily limited to maintaining ceasefires and stabilizing situations on the ground, providing crucial support for political efforts to resolve conflict by peaceful means.‚Äù[ref] ‚ÄúThe early years.‚Äù United Nations. Available online <a href=‚Äùhttp://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/early.shtml‚Äù>here</a>. Retrieved 08/09/2015.[/ref] Modern peacekeeping forces include economists, police officers, legal experts, electoral observers, human rights monitors as well as military personnel.

The first two peacekeeping operations are still ongoing; these are the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in the Middle East and the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). The first armed peacekeeping operation was the First UN Emergency Force (UNEF I) in response to the 1956 Suez Crisis in Egypt. At the end of the Cold-War the focus of UN peacekeeping shifted from primarily dealing with inter-state conflicts to intra-state conflicts/civil wars. For more information on civil wars visit the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/war-peace/civil-wars/" target="_blank">Civil War page on Our World in Data</a>.

<iframe src="http://ourworldindata.org/chart-builder/public/view/94" style="width:100%;height:660px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

Not all peace keeping missions are conducted by the UN. The following chart shows the breakdown of peacekeeping operations by organisation for the decade 2004-2013. In many cases, it is regional alliances or organisations that step in to stabilise conflict zones.

<h3>Peacekeeping Personnel</h3>

The change in the number of UN peacekeepers during the Cold War roughly corresponds to changes in the number of active operations globally. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, this relationship breaks down and we see large reductions in UN personnel size in the late 90s but only a smaller reductions in the number of ongoing operations. A large part of this decline in personnel numbers can be attributed to the failure of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) and the UN's withdrawal from Somalia in 1995. The UN's Peacekeeping website explains:



<blockquote>Missions were established in situations where the guns had not yet fallen silent, in areas such as the former Yugoslavia - UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), Rwanda - UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) and Somalia - UN Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II), where there was no peace to keep.

These three high-profile peacekeeping operations came under criticism as peacekeepers faced situations where warring parties failed to adhere to peace agreements, or where the peacekeepers themselves were not provided adequate resources or political support. As civilian casualties rose and hostilities continued, the reputation of UN Peacekeeping suffered.

The setbacks of the early and mid-1990s led the Security Council to limit the number of new peacekeeping missions and begin a process of self-reflection to prevent such failures from happening again.</blockquote>

<h2>Correlates, Determinants & Consequences</h2>

<h3> Successes </h3>

In recent years, the peacekeeping operation of the UN in Sierra Leone has become an often cited example of successful peacekeeping. From 1999 to 2005, UN peacekeepers worked in Sierra Leone to stabilise the country during and after the civil war. The main objectives of the mission were to assist in the disarmament and enforce the terms of the Lome Peace Agreement. The UN was also involved in setting up a court to try those accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of both international humanitarian law and domestic laws.

A study by Virginia Page Fortna titled <em>Does Peacekeeping Work?</em> looked directly at the outcomes of peacekeeping in instances of civil war.[ref]Blattman, Christopher, and Edward Miguel. "Civil war." <em>Journal of Economic Literature</em> (2010): 3-57. Available online <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3693574" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] She finds that while on average peacekeeping missions have a lower success rate (defined as continued peace), this is due to a selection effect. The selection effect exists because the decision to intervene is not random -- neither is the onset of conflict. Peacekeeping missions are less successful on average because the UN and other peacekeeping organisations only intervene in the most challenging and difficult conflicts. Controlling for these factors, she finds that the presence of peacekeepers reduces the risk of sliding back into civil war by 80 percent. More information on civil wars can be found on the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/war-peace/civil-wars/" target="_blank">Civil War, Our World in Data page</a>.

<h3> Failures </h3>

Unfortunately, the successes of recent UN peacekeeping operations are overshadowed by its failures in Europe and Africa. The Srebrenica Massacre during the Bosnian War of 1992-95 happened on the watch of Dutch UN peacekeepers. The massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys is the worst massacre to have taken place in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

In Africa, the UN failed to prevent the Rwandan genocide of 1994 which left between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people dead. In addition to this, UN peacekeepers in Somalia were forced to withdraw after the situation deteriorated in 1995. The Somali Civil War continued after the UN withdrawal and is still ongoing. Most recently, reports have emerged of UN peacekeepers sexually abusing children in the Central African Republic. The current UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon described the  problem as a "cancer in our system" and has vowed to tackle the problem.[ref] Ban Ki-moon says sexual abuse in UN peacekeeping is 'a cancer in our system'. The Guardian (2015). Available online <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/14/ban-ki-moon-says-sexual-abuse-in-un-peacekeeping-is-a-cancer-in-our-system" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Moore's Law - Exponential Increase of the Number of Transistors on Integrated Circuits</h3>
Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. This accelerating progress is important as the capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's Law and are¬†improving exponentially. I will show how aspects as diverse as processing speed, product price, memory capacity, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras have been progressing with similar speed.

The law was described as early as 1965 by the Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore after whom it is named.[ref]The original paper of Moore (1965) is still hosted by Intel <a href="http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf">here</a>. [/ref]

Before we look at the development so far, I have reprinted the famous little graph that Moore published in 1965.
<h6>Moore's Original Graph: 'The Number of Components per Integrated Function' ‚Äì¬†Intel[ref]</h6>
The source of the graph is Intel <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/events/moores_law_40th/index.htm?iid=tech_mooreslaw+body_presskit">here</a>.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.[/ref]

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Number-of-Components-per-Integrated-Function-Moores-Original-Graph-Moore0.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3954" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Number-of-Components-per-Integrated-Function-Moores-Original-Graph-Moore0.png" alt="The Number of Components per Integrated Function Moore's Original Graph - Moore0" width="358" height="422" /></a>

As you can see, Moore had seven observations from 1959 until 1965 and he predicted a continuing growth saying, "There is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly¬†constant for at least 10 years".[ref]Quoted from the original paper of Moore (1965)¬†<a href="http://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf">here</a>. [/ref]¬†As the next graph shows, he was not only right about the next ten years but astonishingly the regularity he found is true for more than half a century now.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.¬†The line corresponds to exponential growth with transistor count doubling every two years.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Transistor-Count-over-time.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7766" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Transistor-Count-over-time-750x548.png" alt="Transistor-Count-over-time" width="750" height="548" /></a>
<h3>Other Laws of Exponential Technological Progress</h3>
In the following, I show that technological developments in many different respects are growing exponentially. Moore's early observation is important as it showed that technological advances do not progress linearly but exponentially. But in and of itself, the doubling of transistors every two years¬†does not directly matter¬†in our lives. Therefore I ask in which ways¬†the exponential growth of technology matters and will give an overview of how the exponential technological advancement is a driver of technological and social change that very much matters for our live now.

More importantly for us is that the power and speed of computers increased exponentially; the doubling time of computational capacity for personal computers was 1.5 years between 1975 to 2009. The increasing power of a wider range of computers - starting with the¬†first general purpose computer (ENIAC)¬†in 1946 - is shown in the following graph.

<h3>Increasing Product Quality for a Decreasing Price</h3>
Increasing computational power - and increasing product quality¬†- matters indeed more than a mere doubling of transistors. But if the technologically-advanced products are prohibitively expensive then they can only have a limited impact on the whole society. For this reason, it is interesting to look at both the product quality and the price.¬†The author and inventor Ray Kurzweil analyzed the change of price and quality for computing machines since 1900. He not only analyzed the improvements of integrated circuits but also looked at the predecessors - earlier transistors, vacuum tubes, relays and electromechanical computers. What he found is that¬†Moore did not only make a valid prediction of the future, but his description is also valid for the past!¬†The exponential growth rate that Moore picked up in the 1960s was driving technological progress since the beginning of the century.

The following graph shows¬†the computer power that consumers could purchase for a price of $1000. It is especially insightful if one wants to understand how technological progress mattered as a driver of social change.
<h6>Calculations per second per $1000 - exponential growth of computing for 110 years ‚Äì¬†Kurzweil[ref]</h6>
The source of this is the website of Kurzweil <a href=" http://www.kurzweilai.net/exponential-growth-of-computing#!prettyPhoto">here</a>.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.[/ref]
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="//ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1480 aligncenter" src="//ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil.png" alt="Calculations per Second per 1000$ - Exponential Growth of Computing for 110 years - Kurzweil" width="802" height="540" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The extension of the time frame also makes clear how our modern computers evolved. It is an insightful way of understanding that the computer age really is the successor to the Industrial Revolution.</p>
One could also view the previous graph as a function of price instead of calculations per second;¬†in this view you would find an exponentially decreasing price for a given product quality over 110 years.

The implication of this rapid simultaneous improvement in quality and decrease of the product price is that, according to a detailed discussion on reddit (<a href="http://de.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1dazzt/how_far_back_in_time_would_i_have_to_go_for_my/">here</a>), a current laptop (May 2013) has about the same computing power as the most powerful computer on earth in the mid 1990s.
<h3>Exponential Increase of the Electrical Efficiency (computing per kWh) of Computing</h3>
The cost to keep the machine running also matters. Electrical efficiency measures the computational capacity per unit of energy, and it is also important with respect to the environmental impact that energy production has.

The progress in this respect has been tremendous: researchers found that over the last six decades the energy demand for a fixed computational load halved every 18 months.[ref]The source of the paper is in the next side note. A short ungated article on this research is in the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/425398/a-new-and-improved-moores-law/">MIT Technology Review</a>.[/ref]

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.¬†Efficiency doubled every 1.57 years from 1946 to 2009.[/ref]

<h3>Exponential Increase of Computer Memory - Exponentially Increasing Storage Capacity and Decreasing Storage Costs</h3>
Looking at these two pictures below it becomes immediately clear how fast technological progress increased the storage capacity. The left image is a hard disk from 1956 with a storage of 5MB on the right is a cheap modern Micro SD Card that stores as much as 12 800 of the old IBM drive.
<h6>The IBM Model 350 disk file with a storage space of 5MB &amp; an¬†8GB Micro SD Card[ref]</h6>
The original press release of IBM to announce the hard disk can be read <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/650/650_pr2.html">here</a> (from September 14, 1956).

The source for the picture of the micro SD is Wikipedia (cropped).[/ref]

&nbsp;

Considering the time since the introduction of the IBM 350 in 1956, the growth rate of storage capacity has not been as constant as for the other measures discussed before. Early on, technological revolutions boosted the capacity stepwise and not linearly. Yet for the time since 1980, progress has been very steady and at an even higher rate than the increase of computer speed.

The hard disk capacity is based on for-retail products.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.

The increase in storage capacity has been called 'Kryder's Law' after the engineer Mark Kryder and a discussion can be found at his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kryder">Wikipedia site</a>.[/ref]

<h3>Exponential Increase of the Quality &amp; Exponential Decrease of the Price of Digital Cameras</h3>
Exponentially advancing technological progress can not only be found in computing machines. Cameras are a different example: for a given price consumers can¬†buy cameras with more and more pixels. The number of pixels has¬†again exponentially increased. This is shown in the following graph.
<h6>Exponential growth of pixels per Australian dollar, 1994-2005¬†‚Äì¬†Wikipedia[ref]</h6>
The source is <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hendys_Law.jpg">Wikipedia</a> (cropped).

The prices are recommended retail prices of Kodak digital cameras in Australian Dollars. The source says, 'Typically the cameras have been basic models with no zoom as these deliver the highest Pixels per Dollar'.¬†This has been called Hendy's Law.

Note the logarithmic vertical axis chosen to show the linearity of the growth rate.[/ref]

<h3>The Future of Exponential Technological Growth</h3>
The exponential growth rates that we have observed over the last decades seem to¬†promise more exciting technological advances in the future.

Many other types of technology have seen exponential growth rates beyond the ones discussed above. A couple of exceptionally promising examples are: Butters' Law of Photonics and Rose's Law. Butters' Law says the amount of data one can transmit using optical fiber is doubling every nine months,¬†which you can convert¬†and say that the cost of transmission by optical fiber is halving every nine months.¬†Rose's Law describes the exponential growth of the number of qubits of quantum computers. If this growth rate should remain constant, it leads to some mind-bending opportunities.[ref]Here is an article (including a graph of the exponential growth) on Rose's Law by Steve Jurvetson on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/8054771535">flickr</a>.[/ref]

For clarity, the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/war-peace/terrorism/#data-quality-definitions">Data Quality & Definitions section</a> below carefully outlines the definition used in contructing the dataset presented here and compares it with the legal definition in the UK. While acts of terrorism across the globe have increased markedly in recent decades, in most parts of the world it continues to be a relatively rare event and is instead focussed in particular countries or regions of instability.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>

<h3>Historical terrorism</h3>

Terrorism is not a 21st century phenomenon and has its roots in early resistance and political movements. The Sicarii were an early Jewish terrorist organisation founded in the first century AD with the goal of overthrowing the Romans in the Middle East. Judas of Galilee, leader of the Zealots and a key influence on the Sicarii, believed that the Jews should be ruled by God alone and that armed resistance was necessary.

Unlike the Zealots, the Sicarii targeted other Jews they believed to be collaborators or traitors to the cause. The tactics employed by the Sicarii were detailed by the historian Josephus around 50AD: "they would mingle with the crowd, carrying short daggers concealed under their clothing, with which they stabbed their enemies. Then when they fell, the murderers would join in the cries of indignation and, through this plausible behavior, avoided discovery."[ref]<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1202887" target="_blank">Horsley, Richard A. "The Sicarii: Ancient Jewish" Terrorists"." <em>The journal of religion</em> (1979): 435-458.</a>[/ref]

There are many other key examples of terrorism throughout history before the modern terrorism of the 20th century. Guy Fawkes' failed attempt at reinstating a Catholic monarch is an example of an early terrorist plot motivated by religion. Meanwhile, The Reign of Terror during the French Revolution is an example of state terrorism.

<h3>Modern terrorism after the second world war</h3>

The use of terrorism to further a political cause has accelerated in recent years. Modern terrorism largely came into being after the Second World War with the rise of nationalist movements in the old empires of the European powers. These early anti-colonial movements recognised the ability of terrorism to both generate publicity for the cause and influence global policy. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Centre of Security Studies at Georgetown University writes that, "The ability of these groups to mobilize sympathy and support outside the narrow confines of their actual ‚Äútheaters of operation‚Äù thus taught a powerful lesson to similarly aggrieved peoples elsewhere, who now saw in terrorism an effective means of transforming hitherto local conflicts into international issues."[ref]Hoffman, Bruce. <em>Inside terrorism</em>. Columbia University Press, 2013.[/ref] This development paved the way for international terrorism in the 1960s.

The following charts highlight the extent to which acts of terrorism are concentrated geographically in areas of conflict and instability. The first shows how deaths from terrorism has declined in recent years if we exclude deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the global count of terrorist acts spiked in 2006, this was primarily driven by the insurgency in Iraq. The second chart is a time series count of terrorist incidents in a select group of countries.

<h3>Terrorism after 9/11</h3>

The attacks of 11 September 2001, known as 9/11, marked a turning point in world history and the beginning of the 'War on Terror'. The attacks are estimated to have killed 3000 people making it the deadliest terrorist incident in human history. The subsequent War on Terror led to the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The following table summarises the concentration of terrorist attacks pre- and post-9/11. It reveals that terrorism pre-9/11 was concentrated in Latin America and Asia, but shifted to the Middle East post-9/11--Peru, Chile and El Salvador completely disappear from the top 10. More than a quarter of all terrorist attacks between 9/11 and 2008 took place in Iraq.

<h3>Airline hijackings and international terrorism</h3>

The deadliest terrorist attacks in history, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, were the result of two plane hijackings. Yet aviation terrorism has a long history and its development marks the beginning of international terrorism. On 22 July 1968, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked Israeli El Al Flight 426 from London to Tel Aviv via Rome. They diverted the flight to Algiers where they held the Israeli hostages for several days while they negotiated the release of Arab prisoners in exchange for the hostages. Once the terms were agreed the hostages were released with no fatalities.

The success of this early hijacking made it an increasingly popular weapon of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). In 1976 Zehdi Terzi, the first PLO representative to the United Nations, stated that the "first several hijackings aroused the consciousness of the world and awakened the media and world opinion much more--and more effectively--than 20 years of pleading at the United Nations."

While terrorism in the Middle East has spiked in recent years, there have been successes in combating terrorism elsewhere. One notable example is the ETA, the Basque separatist movement in Spain, which put down arms in 2011.

<h3>The risk of terrorism in a broader perspective</h3>

Despite the intense media focus on terrorist activity around the world, the numbers of people actually killed by terrorist attacks has remained low. Terrorism only killed 13,000 in 2010, a relatively low number when compared with other types of violent death, namely armed conflict and interpersonal violence.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants & Consequences</h2>

<h3>Rational motives?</h3>

Martha Crenshaw, professor of Political Science at Stanford, argues that terrorist groups make calculated decisions to engage in terrorism, and moreover, that terrorism is a "political behavior resulting from the deliberate choice of a basically rational actor."[ref]<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/421717" target="_blank">Crenshaw, Martha. "The causes of terrorism." <em>Comparative politics</em> (1981): 379-399.'</a>[/ref]In addition to this, she suggests "Terrorism is a logical choice ... when the power ratio of government to challenger is high."

Crenshaw breaks down the causes of terrorism into three layers:

<ol>
<li><strong>Situational factors</strong>: This can be subdivided into two parts; (1) conditions that allow the possibility of radicalisation and motivate feeling against the 'enemy', and (2) specific triggers (events) for action.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic aims</strong>:
<ul><li>Long-run; political change, revolution, nationalists fighting an occupying force, minority separatist movements </li>
<li>Short-run; recognition or attention to advertise their cause</li>
<li>Disrupt and discredit the process of government</li>
<li>Influence public attitudes; fear or sympathy</li>
<li>Provoke a counter-reaction to legitimise their grievances</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Individual motivations</strong>: This is concerned with psychology and the character traits of terrorists; why do individuals turn to terrorism in the first place? does a 'terrorist personality' or 'terrorist predisposition' exist?</li>
</ol>

<h3>The war on terror</h3>
One major consequence of the rise of international terrorism, particularly Islamic extremist groups, has been the global War on Terror. The War on Terror, which began in 2001, has so far seen the full-scale invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as other operations in Yemen, Pakistan and Syria.

An important question is whether the global campaign against terrorism, known as the War on Terror, has made us any safer. Many commentators argue that the War on Terror has had the perverse effect of making us less safe, with some going as far as claiming the War on Terror is the leading cause of terrorism. Richard Clarke, a counter-terrorism expert that worked in the US National Security Council between 1992‚Äì2003, was highly critical of the Bush administration's counter-terrorism strategy and the decision to invade Iraq.[ref]Clarke, Richard A. <em>Against all enemies: Inside America's war on terror</em>. Simon and Schuster, 2008.'[/ref] Clarke writes: "Far from addressing the popular appeal of the enemy that attacked us, Bush handed that enemy precisely what it wanted and needed, proof that America was at war with Islam, that we were the new Crusaders come to occupy Muslim land."


<h3>The internet</h3>

The internet has become a central tool for terrorists, largely replacing print and other physical media. It has allowed terrorist organisations to costlessly communicate their message and aims to the world, allowing them to recruit new members, coordinate global attacks and better evade surveillance. The terrorist group known as the Islamic State (also, ISIS and ISIL) are arguably the first to harness the power of the internet and social media. Their well-organised online propaganda campaign has seen them recruit thousands of foreign fighters.

The increasing use of the internet was noted by Bruce Hoffman in <em>Inside terrorism</em> as early as 2006. He argues that "terrorists are now able to bypass traditional print and broadcast media via the Internet, through inexpensive but professionally produced and edited videotapes, and even with their own dedicated 24/7 television and radio news stations. The consequences of these developments [are] far-reaching as they are still poorly understood, having already transformed the ability of terrorists to communicate without censorship or other hindrance and thereby attract new sources of recruits, funding, and support that governments have found difficult, if not impossible, to counter."[ref]Hoffman, Bruce. <em>Inside terrorism</em>. Columbia University Press, 2013.[/ref]

<h3>Does terrorism work?</h3>

Measuring the effectiveness of terrorism requires us to have both a well defined set of objectives for a given terrorist organisation as well as a definite way to determine success and failure. Consider the example of 9/11 and whether Al-Qaeda achieved its objectives: If the objective was to destroy America, then it clearly failed. Yet if goal was to intimidate America and publicise the cause, it may be considered a success.

With respect to the question of effectiveness, there are two opposing views in the literature. The first posits that terrorists are able to influence policy and public opinion and that terrorism is increasing worldwide simply because it is effective. The second view argues that terrorists hardly ever achieve their main objectives and that terrorist groups tend to be unstable and disintegrate over time.

Robert Pape, professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, is a major proponent of the view that terrorism can be effective and his research focusses on suicide terrorism. Pape finds that suicide attacks targeted at democracies tend to be more effective at influencing policy.[ref]Pape, Robert Anthony. <em>Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism</em>. Random House Trade Pbk. ed. New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2006.[/ref] Recent research by Eric Gould and Esteban Klor support this view; they find that terrorist attacks in the Arab-Israeli conflict influence public opinion and "cause Israelis to be more willing to grant territorial concessions to the Palestinians."[ref]<a href="http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/125/4/1459.abstract" target="_blank">Gould, Eric D., and Esteban F. Klor.

Max Abrahms argues that terrorism never succeeds. Abrahms analysed 28 groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US State Department in 2001.[ref]<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2006.31.2.42" target="_blank">Abrahms, Max. "Why terrorism does not work." <em>International Security</em> 31, no. 2 (2006): 42-78.</a>[/ref] He finds that the groups only achieved 7 percent of their 42 policy objectives. Moreover, Abrahms suggests that his findings "challenge the dominant scholarly opinion that terrorism is strategically rational behavior." Further support for the idea that terrorism never succeeds comes from Audrey Cronin's research on the collapse of terrorist groups.[ref]Cronin, Audrey Kurth. How terrorism ends: understanding the decline and demise of terrorist campaigns. Princeton University Press, 2009.[/ref] Cronin also finds that terrorist groups fail to achieve their objectives and that these groups only last between 5-9 years on average.
 
 
<h2>Data Quality & Definitions</h2>

<h3>Data quality</h3>

Ivan S. Sheehan has written on the importance of data quality in terrorism research and highlights several key issues that researchers must be aware of when using these datasets.[ref]Sheehan, Ivan Sascha. "Assessing and comparing data sources for terrorism research." In <em>Evidence-based counterterrorism policy</em>, pp. 13-40. Springer New York, 2012.[/ref] Firstly, the issue of definition becomes important. Consider the example of Palestinian terrorist attacks in Israel; should these be coded as international or domestic terrorist attacks. Furthermore, can a state-entity engage in terrorist activity? Issues such as this lead to large discrepancies between commonly used datasets. The following chart shows just how large these discrepancies are between the ITERATE and RAND datasets.

Another issue is that many of these databases were developed in the intelligence and defence communities before being used by researchers. This has meant that they often lag behind the normal data standards of academic datasets, however this is changing. Sheehan also suggests that retrospective data collection can yield underestimates since "not all sources that are available in real time are still available or accessible years later." 

<h3>RAND Database of Worldwide Terrorism Incidents and Bruce Hoffman</h3>
The data visualisations in this page are generated using the RAND Database of Worldwide Terrorism Incidents, and so it is important to understand the definition used in their construction. The RAND database uses the following definition of terrorism:

<blockquote>Terrorism is defined by the nature of the act, not by the identity of the perpetrators or the nature of the cause; key elements include:

<ul>
	<li>Violence or the threat of violence</li>

	<li>Calculated to create fear and alarm</li>

	<li>Intended to coerce certain actions</li>

	<li>Motive must include a political objective</li>

	<li>Generally directed against civilian targets</li>

	<li>Can be a group or an individual</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

Their definition is closed tied to Bruce Hoffman's definition:[ref]Hoffman, Bruce. <em>Inside terrorism</em>. Columbia University Press, 2013.[/ref]

<blockquote>We may therefore now attempt to define terrorism as the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change. All terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects beyond the immediate victim(s) or object of the terrorist attack. It is meant to instill fear within, and thereby intimidate, a wider ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù that might include a rival ethnic or religious group,an entire country, a national government or political party, or public opinion in general. Terrorism is designed to create power where there is none or to consolidate power where there is very little. Through the publicity generated by their violence, terrorists seek to obtain the leverage, influence, and power they otherwise lack to effect political change on either a local or an international scale.</blockquote>

<h3>Legal definition</h3>

One important point of departure in many legal definitions of terrorism is computer hacking. The 'interference with or disruption to an electric system' is explicitly stated in UK terrorism law; this does not fit into the definitions above which centre on violence. The UK the Terrorism Act 2000 defines terrorism as:

<blockquote>
The use or threat of action designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public, or a section of the public; made for the purposes of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause; and it involves or causes:

<ul>
	<li>serious violence against a person;</li>
	<li>serious damage to a property;</li>
	<li>a threat to a person's life;</li>
	<li>a serious risk to the health and safety of the public; or</li>
	<li>serious interference with or disruption to an electronic system.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<h2>The open-source tool to store and visualize data online</h2>
As every other tool developed and used at OurWorldInData this tool is also completely open source and is <em>free to use on any other web publication</em>. <a href="http://github.com/OurWorldInData/our-world-in-data-grapher">The Grapher is completely open source on GitHub</a>.

The <em>OurWorldInData-Grapher</em> is the chart building tool which is used on our web-publication <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/">OurWorldInData.org</a>.

Essentially these are two tools in one:
<ol>
	<li>A first tool allows the author to upload panel data into one central SQL database and tn the process of uploading the data, the author can store all the relevant information about the data source so that the authors get credited and the definitions, units, and other relevant information get stored with the data.</li>
	<li>A second tool then allows to pull any of the data from this database and visualize it in an interactive chart in many, many different ways.</li>
</ol>
We have so far developed the capabilities to visualize data in the following ways:
<ul>
	<li>scatter plot,</li>
	<li>line chart,</li>
	<li>stacked area chart,</li>
	<li>bar chart (horizontal and vertical; single- and multi-bar charts)</li>
	<li>choropleth maps (world maps and maps of all countries and continents)</li>
</ul>
With this tool it will is possible for the reader to pull the information for additional countries from the database and add them to the visualization. The reader can then build her own charts or maps and save it as a .svg vector image or as a .png image. These visualizations work for all countries, many different data types and are highly customizable.
The OurWorldInData-Grapher was developed by the web developers <a href="http://www.zdenekhynek.cz/">Zdenek Hynek</a> and <a href="https://mispy.me/">Jaiden Mispy</a> with the support from Max Roser. Since February 2016 Jaiden Mispy is the developer of the Grapher.

&nbsp;

Zdenek Hynek shows in this short video the basic work flow to store data and create a chart:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fods4ygADLg

The Grapher makes use of the beautiful reusable visualizations made available by two libraries that have been built on top of D3: The library <a href="http://datamaps.github.io">datamaps.js</a> for maps and the <a href="http://nvd3.org">NVD3.js</a> library for line charts, bar charts and some other types of charts. The backend is written in PHP using the Laravel Framework. The frontend is written using Backbone.js. You find more information and the source code on the <a href="http://github.com/OurWorldInData/our-world-in-data-grapher">Grapher page at GitHub</a>.

The data shown is the mean ICCS scale of ‚Äúsupport for equal rights for ethnic minorities‚Äù among grade 8 students.

The explanation and references given by the OECD are the following:
Students‚Äô attitudes towards equal rights for ethnic minorities are captured by the mean ICCS scale of
students‚Äô responses to a series of questions related to attitudes towards minorities‚Äô rights. The questions ask¬†if students express support for equal rights for all ethnic groups. These scales are set to have an international¬†mean of 50 scale points and a standard deviation of 10 points. See Lauglo (2011) for more details on how this¬†scale is developed.
- Lauglo, J. (2011), Statistics of Possible Interest to OECD Based on Data from the IEA International Civic and¬†Citizenship Education Study 2009, unpublished mimeo, Norwegian Social Research (NOVA), Oslo.

Civic knowledge means knowing about and understanding elements and concepts of citizenship, as well as those of traditional civics (Schultz, et al., 2010). The ICCS assessment is based on a 79-item test administered to lower-secondary students (8th grade) and covers issues related to civic society and systems, civic principles, civic participation and civic identities. Three-quarters of the test items involve reasoning and analysis associated with civics and citizenship, while the rest focuses on knowledge about civics and citizenship. Civic knowledge is measured on a scale with an international average of 500 points and a standard deviation of 100. There is significant variation across and within countries in civic knowledge: half of the total variance in civic knowledge was found to be at the student level, a quarter at the school level, and a quarter across countries. See Schulz, et al. (2010) for more details on how civic knowledge is conceptualised.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The past was not peaceful</h3>
It would be wrong to believe that the past was peaceful. One reason why some people might have this impression is that many of the past conflicts feature less prominently in our memories, they are simply forgotten.

An overview of all the conflicts that we have historical knowledge and an estimate of the number of fatalities of is shown in the visualization below.

The red circles visualize all conflicts in the Conflict Catalog (<a href="http://www.cgeh.nl/data#conflict">here</a>) authored by Peter Brecke. Brecke's dataset contains information on 3708 conflicts, but in the more distant past it is still incomplete and for many past conflicts Brecke is either lacking an estimate of the number of fatalities or we can suspect that entire conflicts are completely unknown.
<h6>Global deaths in conflicts, since 1400¬†‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The Conflict Catalog (Violent Conflicts 1400 A.D. to the Present in Different Regions of the World) authored by Peter Brecke contains information on 3708 conflicts, data on parties, fatalities, date and duration between the year 1400 and 2000.
It is available at the Center for Global Economic History <a href="http://www.cgeh.nl/data#conflict">here</a>.

The data on the military death rate after 1946 is taken from the Human Security Report Project, which takes data from the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset v.3.0.

OurWorldInData is an online publication that shows how living conditions around the world are changing. It communicates this empirical knowledge through interactive data visualisations (charts and maps) and by presenting the research findings on global development that explain what drives the changes that we see and what the consequences of these changes are.

The publication is developed at the <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/world-data">University of Oxford</a> and covers a wide range of topics across many academic disciplines: Trends in health, food provision, the growth and distribution of incomes, violence, rights, wars, culture, energy use, education, and environmental changes are empirically analysed and visualised in this web publication. For each topic the quality of the data is discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website is also a database of databases. Covering all of these aspects in one resource makes it possible to understand how the observed long-run trends are interlinked and the research on global development is presented to the audience of interested readers, journalists, academics, and policy people. The articles cross-reference each other to make it possible for the reader to learn about the drivers of the observed long-run trends. For each topic the quality of the data will be discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website works as a database of databases ‚Äì a meta-database.

Our World In Data is made available as a <em><strong>public good:</strong></em> The entire publication is freely available, the data published on the website is available for download, the visualizations published in the web publication are made available under a permissive Creative Commons license, and all the tools to publish OurWorldInData and to create the visualizations are free to use by everyone (completely open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/OurWorldInData/our-world-in-data-grapher">GitHub here</a>).
<h2>What do I find at Our World in Data?</h2>
The idea is to tell the history of our present world ‚Äì based on empirical data and visualised in graphs. Individual data entries deal with the different aspects of living standards. These entries are arranged into <a title="Data" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/">the 16 categories that you find in the data section</a>.

We need to know in which aspects the world has seen progress and why and we also need to show where people live in destitute conditions and present clearly what the big challenges of today are. This helps us to prioritize where and on which aspects policy makers and all of us focus our efforts.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the long-run trends are positive and paint an optimistic view of our world that is unknown to many who only follow the daily news to inform themselves about the world. The research presented on OurWorldInData backs up the statement by Karl Popper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_popper-english-quote.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7157"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7157" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_popper-english-quote-750x375.png" alt="Popper-English-Quote" width="750" height="375" /></a> The empirical view of our world shows how the Enlightenment continues to make our world a better place. It chronicles how human societies became <a title="Homicides" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/violence-rights/homicides/">less violent</a> and increasingly more <a title="Democratisation" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/political-regimes/democratisation/">democratic</a>. The empirical evidence shows how new ideas continue to <a title="Light" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/economic-development-work-standard-of-living/light/">improve living standards</a>, allowing us to live a <a title="Life Expectancy" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/">healthier</a>, <a title="GDP Growth Over the Last Centuries" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-growth-over-the-last-centuries/">richer</a> and <a title="Happiness and Life Satisfaction" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/economic-development-work-standard-of-living/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/">happier</a> life. It is the story of <a title="World Poverty" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">declining poverty</a> and <a title="Food per Person" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/food-per-person/">better food provision</a> in a world <a title="Forest Cover" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/environmental-change/forest-cover/">we care about</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The empirical view on our world shows how misplaced doom and defeatism is and my aim is to encourage those who work to make our world a better place still. At the same time my hope is also to help to change the mind of those of you who do not think that we are creating a better world. By looking at the empirical data I want to explain why I am optimistic about how we are changing our world and why I think it is worthwhile to engage in the global long-term project of Enlightenment. Although most trends are clearly going in the right direction I also show where this is not the case. In a world of hysteria we cannot focus on what is important, but a fact based view on our world should help us to focus on the topics that are most important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We need to present the research that lets us understand why living conditions change. What is driving progress to improve global health and education and how can we further reduce extreme poverty, violence, hunger? We need to bridge the gap between researchers and the public and clearly show that we have it in our hands to work towards a world where living conditions are improving for all of us. We can be more effective when the public ‚Äì including policy makers, journalists, and academics ‚Äì knows where and how we need to act to improve living conditions for every person around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the feedback I know that readers of Our World In Data include academics, policy makers that need to know what works in global development, journalists that want to have a longer view on current events, professors and teachers who use the material for their students, and many laypeople interested in global development.¬† Many members of the general public are interested in how the world is changing but find it hard to get access to the relevant research.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The data-entries on OurWorldInData</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On OurWorldInData overview articles ‚Äì called data entries ‚Äì give the reader an overview of how a particular social, economic or ecological aspect of the world has changed over the long run. The content structure of each data-entry on OurWorldInData is shown in the following figure:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_data-entry-structure.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7163"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7163" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_data-entry-structure-750x383.png" alt="Data Entry Structure" width="750" height="383" /></a>In the <strong>1st section</strong> of every data entry ‚Äì the section titled ‚ÄòEmpirical View‚Äô ‚Äì we present the most important facts of the long-term development of the topic of that data entry. The presentation of these trends makes use of interactive data visualizations and presents the available empirical evidence about what we know about the historical development (up to now) about each of the many different aspects of global development. The data visualizations are a distinctive feature of OurWorldInData and are often used in journalistic and academic articles, on social media and in school and university teaching.</p>
Here is an example for a data visualization in section 1: The world map shows how life expectancy has changed over time. Use the slider below the map to see the change over time. (If you click on Chart in the top right corner you can explore the change for each country in the world.)
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/64?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>Section 2</strong> is titled ‚ÄòDeterminants &amp; Consequences‚Äò. To illustrate and communicate the research findings in this section we also use data visualizations ‚Äì while the summarized (and referenced) research will show the current evidence on what is behind the observed changes and what they mean for our living conditions. To give a concrete <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/">example</a>, while the peer-reviewed research on the causal links between mother‚Äôs education and higher child survival is summarized, this same section is illustrated with the correlation of these two measures across countries.

<strong>Section 3</strong> is a very important section: Too often empirical studies are not critical enough about the data that is used in their empirical research (and this is equally an issue for data visualizations which are shared online for example on social media sites). Section 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄòMeasurement, Data Quality &amp; Definitions‚Äô ‚Äì defines the used measures and explains the limitations of the empirical data by reviewing the literature that scrutinizes data sets.

<strong>Section 4</strong> is pointing the visitor to the relevant original data sources and allows policy makers and interested researchers to study the empirical evidence themselves. This section of each data-entry links to the original sources of the data: This can either be a 1) specialized institute (like the Peace Research Institute Oslo PRIO) or a 2) research article (like Bourguignon &amp; Morrison ‚Äì ‚ÄôInequality Among World Citizens: 1820-1992‚Äô in the American Economic Review [2002]) or a 3) statistical agency that provides relevant data. This section makes the web publication a database of databases ‚Äì a meta-database.

The presentation of text and data makes use of the capabilities of online publishing. Almost all publications on the web ‚Äì including those in the best journals ‚Äì are currently just emulating the possibilities (and restrictions) of publishing on paper. They are published online, yet they as static combinations of text and visuals which were essentially already at the disposal of Johannes Gutenberg when he invented the printing press in the 1440s. OurWorldInData uses the possibilities of the web ‚Äì links that show the interconnectedness of development, options are available to search and explore the publication, and the empirical evidence is presented in interactive visualizations for which OurWorldInData is famous. OurWorldInData moves publishing from a static medium to a dynamic medium with computational responsiveness.
<h2>The 'Grapher'</h2>
The OurWorldInData‚ÄìGrapher is at the heart of this publication. It is the tool that allows us to store all data in an online database and then to visualise this data in line charts, maps, bar charts, scatter plots, area charts etc.

As everything else on OurWorldInData the Grapher is also completely open source.

You find more ‚Äì many examples, a video that shows the backend, and everything else ‚Äì on the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/OWID-grapher/">OurWorldInData page about the Grapher</a>.
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Team</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The intention for this publication was always to be a collaborative publication and from 2015 onwards several researchers and web developers contributed to the content and expanded the technical framework of the publication:</p>
<strong>Current contributors to Our World In Data</strong>

Since February 2016: <strong>Jaiden Mispy</strong>, who is a web developer with experience in the software industry, and is particularly interested in using technology to improve academic collaboration and science communication. In the past, Jaiden has helped build tools for geneticists, quantum physicists, and others, which aid in their research. Jaiden is developing the very heart of this web publication ‚Äì our data storage and data visualization tool <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher/">The OurWorldInData-Grapher</a>. This tool is completely open source and everyone is free to¬†use this¬†tool.

<h2>Why are we working on Our World In Data?</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1) Because the daily news are not enough to know about the world</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To understand how the world is changing it is not enough to follow the daily news. The news that make the headlines focus on events and fail to communicate the slow trends that slowly, and persistently reshape our world.
The important consequence of the media‚Äôs focus on events rather than slow trends is that global development does not get reported. Harm is done in an instant and disasters are happening at once: an earthquake, a plane crash, or the attack of a group of terrorists. In contrast, many of the best news for life on earth are shaped by trends that slowly and over the course of decades or centuries change our world: <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/">Global child mortality fell from 18.2% in 1960 to 4.3% in 2015</a>; while 4.3% is still too high, this is a substantial achievement. But understandably on no day in the last 5 decades was there ever the headline ‚ÄòGlobal Child Mortality Fell by 0.00719% Since Yesterday‚Äô. This is not necessarily a critique of the news media, but it does mean that we have to do more to see that global development is reality. We have to communicate how global living conditions are gradually changing and OurWorldInData aims to be a complementary source that informs us all about the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The motivation for publishing OurWorldInData could not be explained better than in the words of Albert Schweitzer who realized several decades ago:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_schweitzer-english-quote.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7156"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7156" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_schweitzer-english-quote-750x375.png" alt="Schweitzer-English-Quote" width="750" height="375" /></a>
Now we can make a publication on real progress possible, with a reach and in a technological form that was unimaginable by Schweitzer.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2) To make it possible to know about global development</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that the media fails to communicate a large part of global development would be less an issue if our own perception would provide us with an accurate representation of how the world is changing.
Unfortunately this is not the case. And even worse, the lack of information on global development is compounded by, rather than corrected by, our perception: We are bad intuitive statisticians. This ‚Äì in a nutshell ‚Äì is the research result of psychologists and behavioral economists, summarized in Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>.
Two of the important biases that make us such bad intuitive statisticians are:
‚Äì¬†¬† ¬†The <em>availability heuristic</em> biases our perception towards the events that we see repeatedly and for which we can recall examples easily. This is aggravating the predicament of a media that mostly focuses on gloomy event news.
‚Äì¬†¬† ¬†The <em>negativity bias</em> describes the fact that our perception responds more strongly to unpleasant news. From an evolutionary perspective it is clear that it is most important for an organism to survive that it notices danger and threats and therefore to focus on these aspects of our world. But what makes us well equipped for our immediate daily surrounding makes us ill-equipped to understand the world around us at large. The consequence of which is that we pay excessive attention to threats and losses and fail to see opportunities and gains.
To balance these biases we have to develop greater sensitivity in measuring opportunities and gains and we have to measure slow changes over time accurately. To develop this clear-eyed view of our world is what scientists around the world are doing. To communicate these gains, opportunities, and slow trends and to make this research accessible for all of us is what OurWorldInData.org aims to do.
As the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26616">put it</a> when examining why we fail to see human progress: ‚Äòthe diagnosis comes from cognitive science and the cure from data science‚Äô.</p>
The available evidence for how well informed we are about the world suggests that in important aspects this work is vital. Studies show that the public‚Äôs knowledge of how the world is changing in important aspects is sadly rather low. The study ‚Äò<a href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/_assets/sri/perils/">Perils of Perception</a>‚Äô published annually by Ipsos MORI, for example, showed how wrong the British public were about some of the most important trends:¬† <a href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx">One of the findings</a> of the study was that 58% of the British public do not believe that crime is falling, when in fact the ‚ÄòCrime Survey for England and Wales‚Äô shows that incidents of crime in 2012 were 53% lower than in 1995.
Similarly the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/">Gapminder Ignorance Project</a> ‚Äì focusing not on domestic but global trends ‚Äì found that 66% of people in the USA believed that ‚Äòthe proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty‚Äô has increased in the past 30 years.¬† Only 5% of the public knew that it has actually decreased (<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">here</a> is Our World In Data showing the evidence). As the chart below shows, the empirical knowledge about one of the most fundamental changes in our time is not much better in the population with a university degree in the UK.
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_igonorace-in-uk-on-global-poverty-university-population.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7161"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7161" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_igonorace-in-uk-on-global-poverty-university-population-750x525.png" alt="Igonorace-in-UK-on-Global-Poverty-(University-population)" width="750" height="525" /></a>
The issue we are tackling with Our World In Data is that the barriers for the general public to get informed by the important quantitative social research carried out in academic institutions are frustratingly high. OurWorldInData changes this and makes research on social, economic and environmental trends accessible.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3) To pursue more of what works and to get engaged in a world that achieves progress</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The annual question of the science portal Edge is ‚ÄúWhat do you consider the most interesting recent scientific news?‚Äù and Professor <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26616">Steven Pinker answered</a> that in his opinion it is the possibility to ‚Äúquantify human progress‚Äù.
Pinker explains why he considers this to be the most important and interesting news: <em>"Foremost, quantified progress is a feedback signal for adjusting what we have been doing. The gifts of progress we have enjoyed are the result of institutions and norms that have become entrenched in the last two centuries: reason, science, technology, education, expertise, democracy, regulated markets, and a moral commitment to human rights and human flourishing."</em>
The motivation of publishing Our World In Data is indeed to be more constructive about development. We have to know what works so that we pursue more of it. To me this is also about trust in our institutions and about believing in each other. It is too easy to be cynical about the world and cynicism is leading to misanthropy.</p>
The absence of information on global development has an additional sorry consequence: The lack of feedback on our efforts as a society can make us lose trust in ourselves and at the extreme make us lose will to change the world for the better.
Here is how a reader of OurWorldInData put it in an email: ‚Äúnobody is able to accomplish anything when ones mind is preoccupied with negative news, insecurity, and fear. Quite the contrary, to achieve something great we need to know that our efforts are worthwhile, yet understand that many aspects need our work so that we can further improve our world."
It is disempowering if we wrongly think that we are going down the wrong way and contrariwise it can be empowering to know that we are doing something right.
It reinforces development also because it makes us ask questions. To see how agricultural yields have increased or how the child mortality rate is falling in all countries in the world makes you ask questions.
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4) To communicate what we know about global development, to choose better policies</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim for the web publication OurWorldInData.org is to bring together the best available quantitative research on the many different aspects of global development and to present the most reliable empirical data openly to the public.
We believe that communicating knowledge about global development matters for the quality of our democratic political system and ultimately for better decisions by policy makers and citizens. Democracy depends on informed citizens and the knowledge on global development and global challenges will help us to seek better policies.
Democracy crucially depends on informed consent and people view their world very different if they falsely believe that global living conditions are getting worse.¬† Fortunately empirical evidence is increasingly becoming the basis for political discussions and decisions and this project will provide a database for discussants to refer to. It is helpful for this form of political debate because while statistics are becoming the principal language of public argument, a comprehensive platform on global development accessible to the interested citizen does not exist.</p>
OurWorldInData is motivated by the sense that statistics are the dominant language of public argument. The interactive visualizations ‚Äì licensed under a permissive <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA-Creative Commons license</a> ‚Äì are directly <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/media-coverage/">usable for journalists</a> (who can either copy the visualizations or directly embed them in their web publications). The experience with Our World In Data shows that many of us do pay attention to evidence and that there is a strong demand for the research on global development presented in this publication. The reason why research and data on global development does not play a larger part in the public debate and perception is the gap between academia and the wider public. For researchers, policy makers, and the public an open approach to empirical evidence is the best way to maximize the benefits of research.
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5) To know where to focus our efforts</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our World In Data always shows both, the change so far and the challenge ahead. <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/VisualHistoryOf/Poverty.html">In the Visual History of World Poverty</a> we see the reduction of extreme poverty from 44% in 1981 to less than 10% in 2015. This reduction is an extraordinary achievement. But at the same this data visualisation and <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">the accompanying data-entry</a> on OurWorldInData¬† also show that almost 10% of the world population live in extreme poverty ‚Äì clearly an outrageously high number of individuals that live in abysmal living conditions in our present world.
The medical doctor and director of the Global Burden of Disease study Chris Murray believes that ‚ÄúYou could solve humanity‚Äôs most pressing problems once you recognize them [‚Ä¶] that‚Äôs why I keep obsessing about marshaling the facts and putting them in a way for people who need to think about them‚Äù.[ref]Cited after Jeremy Smith (2015) ‚Äì Epic Measures - One Doctor. Seven Billion Patients. <a href="https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780062237507/epic-measures">https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780062237507/epic-measures</a>[/ref] OurWorldInData does both, it shows the successes so far and the pressing challenges ahead so that we know where we should focus our efforts.
We are convinced that portraying the difficult yet successful efforts of humanity will be a helpful way to look at history and our present condition. In this spirit our work is directed against cynicism and in favor of engagement in a developing world.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6) To communicate a broad understanding of development ‚Äì not just economic growth</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The perception and discussion of development is focused on a single, narrow aspect of development: Economic growth.
The growth of incomes is important, yet it is a means to an end and certainly it is no guarantee that we achieve the ends of development that we care about (health, education, human freedom, sustainable relationship with nature and more). Our World In Data promotes a broad understanding of what development means. The aim is to broaden the debate and make measures of health and other aspects of development as ubiquitous and easy to access as data on economic output is today.
The Millennium Development Goals with a focus on health and even more the Sustainable Development Goals with the understanding that development is even broader were steps in the right direction. Our World In Data gives this perspective a permanent home.</p>
As recommended by <a href="http://www.insee.fr/fr/publications-et-services/dossiers_web/stiglitz/doc-commission/RAPPORT_anglais.pdf">Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi (2009)</a>, GDP per capita remains an important part of the empirical perspective on development, but the measure will not be used to capture aspects that it is not able to capture. For the wider range of aspects of development OurWorldInData will also follow the recommendation of the Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi report and present a range of indicators (dashboard approach). The website is therefore structured into 16 categories and aims to communicate the empirical research on all of these aspects:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) Population Growth &amp; Vital Statistics
(2) Health
(3) Food &amp; Agriculture
(4) Resources &amp; Energy
(5) Environmental Change
(6) Technology &amp; Infrastructure
(7) Growth &amp; Distribution of Prosperity
(8) Economic Development, Work &amp; Standard of Living
(9) The Public Sector &amp; Economic System
(10) Global Interconnections
(11) War &amp; Peace
(12) Political Regime
(13) Violence &amp; Rights
(14) Education &amp; Knowledge
(15) Media &amp; Communication
(16) Culture, Values &amp; Society</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7) To counter fatalism and make us appreciate the progress the world has achieved</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nostalgia for a better past is widespread and many see the world in decline. The chart shows, few of us are optimistic.[ref]The underlying data is published <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/z2knhgzguv/GB_Website.pdf">here</a>. YouGov covered the same data <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/01/05/chinese-people-are-most-optimistic-world/">here</a>.[/ref]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_optimistic-about-the-future.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7162"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7162" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ourworldindata_optimistic-about-the-future-750x525.png" alt="Optimistic-about-the-future" width="750" height="525" /></a></p>
Our World In Data seeks to put this widespread pessimism in context. In the best case people will question their pessimism about the world and it is an initiative that fosters a kind of public optimism. For this effort to succeed we need to present the picture of true progress that we see in the data.¬† Steven Pinker <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26616">again</a>: <em>"Quantified human progress emboldens us to seek more of it. A common belief among activists is that any optimistic datum must be suppressed lest it lull people into complacency. Instead, one must keep up the heat by wailing about ongoing crises and scolding people for being insufficiently terrified. Unfortunately, this can lead to a complementary danger: fatalism.‚Äù</em>

Because our hopes and efforts for building a better future are inextricably linked to our perception of the past it is important to understand and communicate the global development up to now. Studying our world in data and understanding how we overcame challenges that seemed insurmountable at the time should also give us confidence and guidance to tackle the problems we are currently facing. It is easy to be cynical about the world and to maintain that nothing is ever getting better. But fortunately the empirical evidence often contradicts this view. We believe it is partly due to a lack of relevant and understandable information that a negative view on how the world is changing is so very common.
This is the perspective on the world that OurWorldInData presents and the ambition is that seeing the world through this online publication makes more of us appreciate the progress the world has achieved and seek more of it in the future.
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Impact of OurWorldInData</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started preparing this publication in 2011 and in June last year and made the website available online in June 2014. Since then more than 2,00,000 people have visited OurWorldInData.org. Over the last year more than <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/media-coverage/">200 articles</a> portrayed the project or used material on global development from OurWorldInData.</p>
English speaking media outlets using OurWorldInData include <em>The New York Times, The Washington Post, Forbes, Slate, Vox, Foreign Policy, Thomson Reuters, The Guardian, Quartz, Bloomberg, World Economic Forum, Business Insider, The Financial Times, and the New Yorker.</em>
Non-English speaking media outlets using OurWorldInData include La Presse (Canada &amp; France), Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung (Switzerland), Svenska Dagbladet (Sweden), Veja (Brazil), Les Echos (France), Bild am Sonntag (Germany), Polimaty (Poland), Aftenposten (Norway), Rue 89 (France), Blic (Serbia), Chabad (Israel), Scientias (Dutch), Jutarnji (Croatia), Rusplt (Russian), Kushima (Japan), Berlingske (Denmark), Vice (Italy), Contrepoints (France), RPP (Peru), S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (Germany), Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Germany), and Der Spiegel (Germany).
<p style="text-align: justify;">In videos and television material from Our World In Data has been used by the BBC in <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/">an hour-long documentary on global poverty with Hans Rosling</a>, by German speaking stations (such as ORF), and in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5DZF7YvwwM">work</a> of the author John Green.
On the radio and in podcasts Our World In Data and its content was discussed in detail by public radio stations in Germany (SWR, BR, Deutschland Radio), <a href="http://datastori.es/data-stories-57-human-dev-w-max-roser/">Data Stories</a>, Forschergeist, and WNYC (<a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/news-grim-until-you-look-data/">Takeaway</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the feedback we know that the content of OurWorldInData is used widely in teaching and in lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visualising data is a form of knowledge compression and the experience has shown that investing in Our World In Data is therefore an effective way to communicate research through the media and influence policy and public understanding of our world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">History of OurWorldInData</h2>
In 2011 I started working on this publication by myself. The first idea was to write a book that presents a long-run perspective on global development, but since I found it was difficult to find the empirical literature and empirical data on global development¬†I changed these plans and decided to provide this basic information for everyone online myself. In the following years my supervisor Sir Tony Atkinson and I developed the concept for such a publication, I collected a lot of data to structure and plan this publication. Over the following years this was my project that I worked on on weekends and the evenings. In 2014 I was done with¬†a first basic version of the¬†website and made OurWorldInData available online.

Over the course of 2015 the project was hosted at the Institute for New Economic Thinking and the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford while the financial support was provided by a small research grant from the London-based Nuffield Foundation.
Now, from 2016 onwards this work will be carried out at the University of Oxford‚Äôs <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Martin School</a>. The Martin School is an interdisciplinary research institution within the University of Oxford and close links between the publication of OurWorldInData and the Martin School already exist. However, funding is only secured for the first 6 months of 2016 and during this period the project has to be successful to secure funding for a longer time horizon, otherwise it will not continue.

&nbsp;

The Oxford Martin School was chosen as the institution to host this work as it is a truly interdisciplinary research institution with a focus on the challenges of global development. It is therefore the ideal place to carry out this research.
A small selection of the names of the <a href="http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/">other programs</a> at the Martin School makes clear that there is a close-knit research environment around OurWorldInData from which this publication can benefit: Global Health, Armed Conflict, Migration, Climate Change, Food, Vaccines, and the Future of Humanity Programme are some of the related programmes.
Collaborations with several of these and other research programs of the Martin School are already established and were already useful in the development of OurWorldInData.org.

The best aspect of the work on Our World In Data was that we are now able to work on this project as a team. The web developer Jaiden Mispy and the research economist Dr Esteban Ortiz Ospina have both made a tremendous contribution to this free online publication. Their work is only possible thanks to the very generous donations that we receive from readers! (You can support our work <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/support/">here</a>.)
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Work in Progress</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right now this website is still very much work in progress. We are always looking for data. So if you know of or come across some data that might be relevant for this project please let me know. There is a full <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/list-of-all-data-entries/">List of all current and future data-entries</a>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How we choose which data to present</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 7 guidelines to decide which sources to accept and which data to present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1) As far back into the past as possible - but up to today</strong>
The goal is to give a perspective on the long-term development and therefore we always aimed for finding data series that reach back as far as possible. Unfortunately the availability of data is often itself an achievement of modern development and data is not available for the more distant past. A solution for this problem is data that has later been reconstructed and we aim to give a more complete picture by taking this data into account.
At the same time the idea is also to present a 'history of the present' and we therefore also want to ensure that the data presented reaches until today.
<strong>2) As global as possible</strong>
A second objective is to give an account of each topic that includes as many societies, countries, and world regions as possible.
<strong>3) Present data in its entirety</strong>
Shorter sample periods may mask important trends and a recent reversal of a long-term trend could be falsely interpreted as the direction of the long-term trend. The merit of taking a historical perspective that studies long-term trends is that it shows the direction in which some aspect of our world is developing. Therefore we also always ensure to present the whole dataset and we do not want to cut off the original data.
<strong>4) Comparable through time and across societies</strong>
A third objective is to ensure that the data we present is comparable across time and across societies. In particular absolute numbers are mostly not meaningful when compared between societies with very different population sizes. It is not surprising that there are many more higher educated people today than a century ago, but this obviously does not mean that the educational background of today's population is better than in the past ‚Äì it could simply mean that there are more people overall. To make measures comparable we aim to include relative measures that account for the differences in population size.
<strong>5) There is no other data - or we would include this data</strong>
An important promise is that we are not withholding any data that would give a different impression of the long-term development of some aspect. If two credible sources would publish statistics that contradict each other then we would say so.
<strong>6) Reference the original source</strong>
To make the data base useful for readers and credit the important work of those who construct the data presented here we aim to always reference the original source of the data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We could very well fail to notice that we violated our own guidelines: If you find that we are not following my own guidelines, or you have any other complaints, please contact us through the form above.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Media Coverage</h2>
The media coverage of OurWorldInData.org is now moved to a <a title="Media Coverage of OurWorldInData.org" href="http://ourworldindata.org/media-coverage/">dedicated page</a> that lists all coverage that we are aware of.

<h3>Inequality of Food Consumption in France and England</h3>
Before modern technology increased the productivity of the agricultural sector, food was very scarce in both England and France. In both countries the inequality in food consumption was very high, and it was only small share of the population that had enough to eat. As it is shown in the following graph, the highest decile consumed roughly three times as much much as the lowest decile. Fogel[ref]Fogel (2004) -¬†The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100: Europe, America, and the Third World. New York: Cambridge University Press.[/ref] points out how grave the consequences for the poor were: 'Individuals in the bottom 20 percent of the caloric distributions of France and England near the end of the eighteenth century lacked the energy for sustained work and were effectively excluded from the labor force. Moreover, even those who participated in the labor force had only relatively small amounts of energy for work.'
<h6>Inequality of food consumption ‚Äì daily food consumption (in kcal) for men aged 20-39 at the end of the eighteenth century in France and England ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
I have taken this data from table 2.4 in Floud, Fogel, Harris, and Hong (2011) - The Changing Body: Health, Nutrition, and Human Development in the Western World since 1700.

&nbsp;

The data refers to food consumption per consuming unit. The authors explain what a consuming unit refers to: "In order to standardize for the age and sex distribution of a population, it is convenient to convert the per capita consumption of calories into consumption per equivalent adult male aged 20‚Äì39 (referred to as a consuming unit). This transformation involves weighting persons at each age and sex relative to adult males aged 20‚Äì39." (Quote from the same book, page 44).[/ref]

<h3>Improving Food Supply in Early Modernized Countries</h3>
As productivity increased, famines and the exclusion of the poor due to hunger and too little energy became a thing of the past in both France and England. The improving supply of food in both countries is shown in the following data visualization.¬†In terms of calories, the average food supply in France more than doubled over the last 300 years. Fogel (2004)[ref]Fogel (2004) - The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700-2100: Europe, America, and the Third World.[/ref], the original source for some of the presented data, brings the numbers in perspective: 'the energy value of the typical diet in France at the start of the eighteenth century was as low as that of Rwanda in 1965, the most malnourished nation for that year in the tables of the World Bank'.

<h3>The Global Perspective on Food Supply</h3>
While the population in the early modernized countries consumed more than 2500 kcal on average by the turn from the 19th to the 20 century other world regions lagged behind. Goklany (1999) presents data taken from the FAO to give a global overview on food consumption since the 1930s. As we have seen before France - the highest series on the graph¬†- has already left the hungry past behind. The other three countries for which we have data before 1960 are Brazil, China and India, and none of these countries managed to increase the food supply before 1960. But over the last six decades this has changed considerably, and all series presented in the graph are now trending upwards. This is an especially huge achievement as the <a title="World Population Growth" href="http://explainingprogress.com/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/">population increased massively in our world</a>,¬†but that is the nature of productivity growth - while there are more and more people there is still more and more for each of them.

The most widely used data on food supply and consumption is published by the UN ¬†Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This data is annually available and is updated by the FAO but it only goes back until 1961. I have presented this data in the last graph. It shows that food supply has been almost constant in Oceania and Europe while it has been rising rapidly in the rest of the world. The rise in the poorer regions of the world means that in terms of food supply we are living in a more and more equal world. At the beginning of this entry we have seen the huge gap between the rich and the poor within countries. Now we see that, similarly to what has happened within countries, we are now experiencing a constantly decreasing inequality across the world. As we are certainly heading in the right direction, it is also true that we are surely not where we want to be. Technological progress, better institutions, research and education ended malnutrition in parts of the world - and this is certainly not a small achievement - but we have to continuously improve to end malnutrition for everyone.

Health is a fundamental aspect of quality of life, not only because being free from illness or injury directly affects our capacity to enjoy life, but also because health indirectly affects our capacity to produce and consume other valuable goods and services.

In this entry we begin by providing an overview of the available empirical evidence on aggregate health <em>outcomes</em>, focusing on lon-run cross-country data from mortality and morbidity tables; and then provide an analysis of available evidence on health <em>determinants</em>, focusing specifically on the returns to macro healthcare investments.

Life expectancy is the most commonly used measure used to describe a population's health. Historical data shows that global life expectancy has increased drastically over the last couple of centuries, with substantial long-run improvements in all countries around the world. In fact, recent life expectancy gains in developing countries have helped reduce global inequalities. However, despite recent progress towards long-run cross-country convergence, there are still huge differences that have to be addressed: people in sub-Saharan Africa have a life expectancy of less than 60 years, compared to 80 years in countries such as Japan.

Historical reductions in child mortality and maternal mortality have been crucial to improving life expectancy around the world. But also for these two measures of health we observe large remaining inequalities: low-income countries still have, on average, child mortality rates that are more than ten times higher than those in high-income countries. We show that similarly large gaps remain for other measures of health, including recent burden-of-disease estimates.

A growing body of empirical research suggests that, at a macro level, health outcomes are highly responsive to healthcare investments. Moreover, as one would expect, the evidence suggests large health returns to healthcare expenditure at low levels of baseline expenditure. This implies that international resources channeled through development assistance for health, if suitably targeted and managed, have the potential of drastically reducing global inequalities in living standards.

<h3>Life Expectancy</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
One way to assess health in a population is by looking at mortality data. Life expectancy is the most commonly used measure to aggregate mortality data in order to describe a population's health. It measures how many years, on average, a person is expected to live based on current age and sex-specific death rates.

<em><strong>Further in-depth information on life expectancy, including definitions, data sources, historical trends and much more, can be found in our dedicated entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">Life Expectancy</a>.</strong> </em>
<h4>How has cross-country life expectancy changed in the long-run?</h4>
The following visualization summarises available life expectancy data over the last few centuries. The estimates from the UK ‚Äì the country for which we have the longest time-series ‚Äì show that life expectancy before 1800 was very low, but since then it has increased drastically. We can see that in less than 200 years the UK doubled life expectancy at birth. And the data shows that similarly remarkable improvements also took place in other European countries during the same period.

The chart below also shows large historical changes in life expectancy estimates for other countries. Notice, for example, that a century ago life expectancy in India and¬†South Korea was as low as 23 years ‚Äì and a century later, life expectancy in India almost tripled, and in South Korea almost quadrupled.

You can switch to the map view in this visualization by clicking on the corresponding tab, in order to compare life expectancy across countries. The map shows that, despite long-run cross-country convergence, there are still huge differences between countries: people in some sub-Saharan African countries have a life expectancy of less than 50 years, compared to 80 years in countries such as Japan.

The increase in life expectancy happened to a significant extent because of changing mortality patterns at a young age, but this was not the only reason: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/health-inequality/">life expectancy increased for people at all ages</a>.

The visualization below shows the cumulative share of the world population (horizontal axis) against the corresponding life expectancy (vertical axis) at different points in time (colored lines). You can think of this as a bar-chart of life expectancy by country, but where countries have been ordered by life expectancy, and the width of each bar has been drawn proportional to each country's share of the world population.

For 1800 (red line) we see that the countries on the left ‚Äì including India and also South Korea ‚Äì have a life expectancy of around 25 years. And on the very right we see that in 1800 no country had a life expectancy above 40 (Belgium had the highest life expectancy with just 40 years).

In 1950 life expectancy in all countries was higher than in 1800, but we can see that inequality grew substantially. This happened because very large improvements in health outcomes took place in some countries (mainly the richer countries in Europe and North America), while others (notably India and China) made only little progress.

In 2012 (green line), we can see again an improvement in life expectancy across all countries; yet interestingly, improvements in this last period implied a <em>reduction</em> in inequality. This happened through very large recent improvements in life expectancy across developing countries.

The conclusion is that the world developed from equally poor health in 1800, to great inequality in 1950, and back to more equality today ‚Äì but equality at a much higher level.
<h6>Life expectancy of the world population, 1800, 1950 and 2012[ref]The data on life expectancy is taken from Version 7 of the <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/">dataset published by Gapminder</a>. The <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/">data on the population of each country</a> is also taken from Gapminder.</h6>
The included world population in 1800 is 1,036 billion. In 1950 it is 2,72 billion. And for 2012 it is the life expectancy of that year and the population measures refer to 2010 (7 billion people are included in this analysis).[/ref]

<h4>Inequality in life expectancy within countries decreased hugely in the long run</h4>
We have already pointed out that recent improvements in life expectancy across developing countries have implied substantial reductions in global health inequalities. But has inequality in life expectancy also implied large within-country reductions in health inequality?

This question can be addressed by measuring inequality in the distribution of years of life within countries, in the same way that we measure, for example, inequality in the distribution of incomes. The idea is to estimate the extent to which a small share of a country's population concentrates a large 'stock of health', hence living much longer than most of the population in the same country.

The following visualization presents estimates of inequality of lifetimes as measured by the mortality Gini coefficient. A high Gini coefficient here means a very unequal distribution of years of life ‚Äì that is, large within-country dispersion around the average number of years that people live. These estimates are from Peltzman (2009)[ref]Sam Peltzman,¬†‚ÄúMortality Inequality‚Äù, Journal of Economic Perspectives 23(4), Fall 2009: 175-19. Online <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.23.4.175">here</a>.[/ref], where you can find more details regarding the underlying sources and estimation methodology. For an analogous discussion of inequality in the context of incomes, see our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/">Income Inequality</a>.

As can be seen in the chart below, inequality in health outcomes has also fallen within countries.

To place these numbers in perspective, we can compare the changes in mortality Gini coefficients with contemporaneous changes in income Gini coefficients. Peltzman (2009) notes that the numerical decline in mortality Ginis seems to have exceeded the decline of income Ginis in the last century or so ‚Äì which suggests that there has been a larger contribution to social equality from improved longevity than from income redistribution.

<h3>Child mortality</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
In the preceding section we studied life expectancy at birth as a key measure of aggregate health in a population. This measure provides an overview of health outcomes for the average person in a country. In this section we focus on health outcomes specifically for children.

An analysis of mortality for children provides important information regarding aggregate health in a country, because the first years of life are characterised by important health-related challenges. Consequently, life expectancy increases substantially conditional on surviving the first years of life. Indeed, as we shall show, an important part of the gains in life expectancy at birth are precisely due to large reductions in child mortality.

Child mortality is usually measured as the probability per 1,000 live births that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five under current age-specific mortality patterns.

<em><strong>Further in-depth information on child mortality, including definitions, data sources, historical trends and much more, can be found in our dedicated entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality">Child Mortality</a>.</strong></em>
<h4>How has cross-country child mortality changed in the long-run?</h4>
The interactive time-series plot below shows how child mortality has changed over the long run. As we can see, child mortality in industrialised countries today is below 5 per 1,000 live births ‚Äì but these low mortality rates are a very recent development. In pre-modern countries child mortality rates were between 300 and 500 per 1,000 live births. In developing countries the health of children is quickly improving ‚Äì but child mortality is still much higher than in developed countries.

A second interesting feature of the trends depicted in this chart is that there are many sharp ‚Äòspikes‚Äô in the 19th century. This is partly because the data quality is improving over time, but also because health crises were more frequent in pre-modern times. The decline of crises is an important aspect of improving ‚Äòliving standards‚Äô. In our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/volatility-of-food-prices/#year-to-year-variation-in-the-price-of-wheat-in-pisa-1351-1799-o-gradaref">food price volatility</a> you find empirical evidence of how frequent food crises were. In the following plot you can see what these and other crises ‚Äì epidemics or wars, for example ‚Äì meant for the health of the population.

You can switch to the map view in this visualization by clicking on the corresponding tab, in order to compare child mortality estimates across countries and time. The map reinforces what we already noted: all countries have reduced child mortality in the long run, but there are still large differences between developed and developing countries.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Are developing countries catching up with low child mortality rates in developed countries?</h4>
The fact that developing countries have made particularly fast improvements to reduce child mortality in the last fifty years, has meant that cross-country gaps have been closing. The following visualization shows child mortality estimates by income level of countries for the period 1960-2012. We can see a clear downward trend across all groups. And since high-income countries have seen the slowest progress (due to their already high health outcomes) we can see that the gap between these countries and the rest of the world has been narrowing. Upper middle income countries are in fact close to catching up.

Nevertheless, the latest figures show the important challenges that remain: low-income countries have, on average, child mortality rates that are still more than ten times higher than in high-income countries. The remaining gap is still large.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-by-income-level-of-country" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Maternal mortality</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
Similarly to child mortality, maternal mortality provides important information regarding the level of health in a country.

Maternal mortality is usually defined as the number of women dying from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant, or within 42 days of pregnancy termination (typically expressed as a ratio per 100,000 live births).

<em><strong>Further in-depth information on maternal mortality, including definitions, data sources, historical trends and much more, can be found in our dedicated entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality">Maternal Mortality</a>.</strong> </em>
<h4>Maternal mortality reduced in the long run</h4>
The visualizations above highlight the drastic long-term improvements that countries have made to reduce child mortality. But have these health improvements also materialized for mothers?

The chart below shows long-run maternal mortality estimates for a selection of mainly high income countries. We can see that a hundred years ago, out of 100,000 child birth, between 500 and 1,000 ended with the death of the mother. This means every 100th to 200th birth led to the mother‚Äôs death. Since <a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/fertility-rates/">women gave birth much more often than today</a>, the death of the mother was a common tragedy. Today, these countries have maternal mortality rates close to 10 per 100,000 live births.

The decline of maternal mortality to around 10 per 100,000 births can be attributed to our modern scientific understanding of the causes leading to maternal mortality. In fact, a common reason for mothers to die was puerperal fever (or childbed fever), which was caused by unhygienic conditions leading to infections in the mothers' genital tract during childbirth. It was the physician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> who first noticed the link between hygiene and the survival of mothers in the middle of the 19th century, but it was only until the germ theory of disease became known that appropriate practices became widely adopted.

The visualization below also shows that different countries have achieved progress in maternal mortality at different points in time. The decline of maternal mortality in Finland, for example, began in the middle of the 19th century and didn‚Äôt reach today‚Äôs low level until more than a century later. Malaysia in contrast achieved this progress in only a few decades.
<h6>Maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births) over the long run[ref]
The visualized data is taken from Claudia Hanson (2010) ‚Äì¬†Gapminder Documentation 010 - Documentation for Data on Maternal Mortality Historical information compiled for 14 countries (up to 200 years). The accompanying documentation is online <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd010/">here</a>.</h6>
If data is given for time brackets of more than a year, then observations have been plotted at the midpoint of the bracket.

<h4>How do countries around the world currently compare in terms of maternal mortality?</h4>
Recent data on maternal mortality shows improvements around the world. The following interactive visualization presents a world map of maternal mortality rates for the period 1990-2013. You can switch to the chart view to explore country-specific trends.

As before, the conclusion here is that despite recent widespread improvements in the developing world, there are huge challenges ahead: in sub-Saharan Africa more than 500 mothers die per 100,000 live births. This is more than 60 times higher than the figure for countries in the European Union.

<h3>Burden of disease</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
In the preceding sections we discussed health outcomes, as measured only from data on mortality. Here we discuss a related, but different measure of health that accounts for the incidence and burden of disease.

The most common way to measure the burden of disease is to estimate the number of 'lost' years due to poor health ‚Äì the so-called loss in Disability Adjusted Life Years, or DALYs. This variable is calculated as the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality, and the years of productive life lost due to disability. As such, the measure of a country's DALYs extends the notion of life expectancy, in the sense that it incorporates both the prevalence of different diseases or risk factors, and the relative harm they cause. One DALY lost can be thought of as one lost year of ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô life. You can read more about the definition and calculation of DALYs in the technical report <a href="http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/GlobalDALYmethods_2000_2011.pdf">WHO methods and data sources for global burden of disease estimates</a>.

<em><strong>Further in-depth information on burden of disease can be found in our dedicated entry on <a>Burden of Disease</a>.</strong></em>
<h4>How many healthy life years are lost around the world due to diseases and disabilities?</h4>
The following visualization presents a map of Disability Adjusted Life Years. The source for the data is the <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">Global Burden of Disease Project</a>, which estimates that in 2012, around 2.8 billion healthy live years were lost to premature death or compromised by disability. The map shows that a large part of these lost years of healthy lives are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa.

In a recent scientific article, GBD (2015)[ref]Vos, T., Barber, R. M., Bell, B., Bertozzi-Villa, A., Biryukov, S., Bolliger, I., ... &amp; Duan, L. (2015). Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990‚Äì2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. The Lancet, 386(9995), 743-800.[/ref] provide the following analysis of this data: <em>"Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLD [(years lost due to disability)] are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa."</em>

<h4>How do different health conditions contribute towards the burden of disease?</h4>
The following visualization ‚Äì produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) ‚Äì presents a breakdown of burden-of-disease estimates for selected countries. A dedicated <a href="http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/">IHME website</a> provides a fascinating interactive tool to explore all available data on burden of disease worldwide.

As the chart below shows, different conditions contribute differently to health outcomes depending on the specific country and gender. While in Angola there are clear challenges relating to HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea and malaria, in countries such as the US or Germany, the biggest challenges relate to cardiovascular and respiratory disease and cancer (the main cause of 'neoplasms').

<h3>Incidence of Disease</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
The data from the <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">Global Burden of Disease Project</a>, discussed above, shows that there are still important challenges regarding certain diseases, notably HIV/AIDS and malaria. Here we discuss trends showing how the fight against these diseases is evolving.

The most common way of measuring the evolution of diseases is to estimate the number (and frequency) of deaths caused by the diseases; as well as the number of new people suffering from them.

<em><strong>Further in-depth information can be found in our entries dedicated to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids/">HIV/AIDS</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria/">Malaria</a>.</strong> </em>
<h4>How is the world progressing in the fight against HIV/AIDS?</h4>
The 1990s saw a large increase in the number of people infected with HIV and dying of AIDS. At the height of the AIDS crisis, almost 3.7 million people were diagnosed with HIV per year. However, after 1997 the number of new diagnoses began to slow down; and eventually around 2005, the annual number of deaths from AIDS began to decrease. As a consequence, the number of people living with HIV is beginning to plateau.

The following chart shows these global trends. According to the <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/publications/2012/name,76120,en.asp">UNAIDS 2012 report</a>, in most regions of the world the number of new infections has decreased or stayed fairly steady since 2001. However, the number of new HIV infections has actually increased in the Middle East and North Africa.

<h4>How is the world progressing in the fight against malaria?</h4>
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the WHO has published global estimates of the number of people dying from malaria. The following visualization presents these estimates. As we can see, in these 15 years the global death toll has been cut in half: from 839,000 deaths in 2000 to 438,000 in 2015.

Africa is the world region that is most affected by malaria. In 2015, the African continent held 9 out of 10 malaria victims (click on the button labeled 'Relative' to see this). Importantly, however, Africa is also the world region that has achieved most progress: from 2000 to 2015, African deaths from malaria were reduced from 764,000 to 395,000.

<h2>Cross-country Health Determinants</h2>
<h3>The 'production' of health outcomes</h3>
Economists often think of health as a ‚Äòstock‚Äô variable relating to the absence of illness or injury. As such, health is often thought of as an individual characteristic beginning with inherited conditions (e.g. genetics) and evolving over time as a function of other inputs, such as environmental conditions and medical care.[ref]More precisely, the economics literature treats health as a ‚Äòdurable capital stock‚Äô that yields an output of ‚Äòhealthy time‚Äô. The main idea in such models is that individuals inherit an initial amount of this stock that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. This conceptualization gives rise to a household production function model of consumer behavior that can be employed to account for the gap between health as an output and medical care as one of many inputs into its production. For more details see Culyer, A. J., &amp; Newhouse, J. P. (Eds.). (2000). Handbook of health economics. Elsevier. [/ref] In general, the inputs for ‚Äòproducing health‚Äô fall under the following broad categories:
<ul>
 	<li>Biology and genetics (e.g. inherited conditions)</li>
 	<li>Public policy and regulation (e.g. vaccination campaigns)</li>
 	<li>Healthcare (e.g. timely treatment and diagnosis of disease)</li>
 	<li>Habits (e.g. smoking)</li>
 	<li>Social and environmental factors (e.g. exposure to crime, pollution)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health returns to healthcare investment</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
Arguably the most important input to health is health<em>care</em>. Here we study cross-country evidence of the link between aggregate healthcare consumption and production, and health outcomes.

The most common way of measuring national healthcare consumption and production is to estimate aggregate expenditure on healthcare (typically expressed as a share of national income).

<em><strong>More information about the provision of healthcare can be found in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">Financing Healthcare</a>.</strong></em>
<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy?</h4>
Healthcare is one of the most important inputs to produce health. The following visualization shows the cross-country relationship between life expectancy at birth and healthcare expenditure per capita. This chart shows the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available (1995 and 2014 respectively). The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. As it can be seen, countries with higher expenditure on healthcare per person tend to have a higher life expectancy. And looking at the change over time, we see that as countries spend more money on health, life expectancy of the population increases.

Notice that the relationship in this chart seems to follow a pattern of 'diminishing returns': the increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in healthcare expenditure decreases as expenditure increases. This means the proportional highest gains are achieved in countries with low baseline levels of spending. This pattern is similar to that observed <a href="/life-expectancy/#life-expectancy-and-gdp">between life expectancy and per capita income</a>.

The countries are color-coded by world region, as per the inserted legends. Many of the green countries (Sub-Saharan Africa) achieved remarkable progress over the last 2 decades: health spending often increased substantially and life expectancy in many African countries increased by more than 10 years. The most extreme case is Rwanda, where life expectancy has increased from 32 to 64 years since 1995 (which was one year after the Rwandan genocide). The graph also shows that the African countries that suffered the most under the HIV/AIDS epidemic ‚Äì Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa ‚Äì experienced a decline of life expectancy from which they have not yet recovered.

The two most populous countries of the world ‚Äì India and China ‚Äì are emphasized by larger arrows. It is interesting to see that in 1995 China achieved good health outcomes at comparatively low levels of health spending.

The association between health spending and increasing life expectancy also holds for rich countries in Europe, Asia, and North America in the upper right corner of the chart. The US is an outlier that achieves only a comparatively short life expectancy considering the fact that the country has by far the highest health expenditure of any country in the world.

You can also explore this relationship between healthcare spending and child mortality in an <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-vs-healthcare-expenditure">interactive visualization</a>.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-life-expectancyl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8304" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-life-expectancyl-750x525.png" alt="health-exp-vs-life-expectancyl" width="750" height="525" /></a>
<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and child mortality?</h4>
The following visualization presents the relationship between child mortality and healthcare expenditure per capita. Global data on health expenditure per capita is available since 1995 and in this chart we show the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available. The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. We can see that child mortality is declining as more money is spent on health.

Focusing on changes over time, we can see a particularly striking fact: while there is huge inequality in levels ‚Äì child mortality in the best-performing countries is almost 100-times lower than in the worst ‚Äì inequality in trends is surprisingly stable. Specifically, if you look at the paths over time it is surprising how little heterogeneity there is between very different countries in the world. No matter whether it is a rich country in Europe or a much poorer country in Africa, the proportional decline in child mortality associated with a proportional increase in health expenditure is remarkably similar.

The visualization also shows the very high global inequality in health spending per capita that is still prevalent today. In the Central African Republic only 25 international-$ are spent per capita while on the other end of the distribution, in the US, 9,403 international-$ are spent. The ratio between the two countries is 376; on average Americans spent more on health per day than a person in the Central African Republic spends in an entire year. This is a very large gap, considering that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/#international-gdp-comparisons-market-vs-ppp-exchange-rates">International-$</a> are adjusted for price differences between countries ‚Äì if price differences were not taken into account, and the spending would have been expressed in US-$ by simply using the exchange rate between the different currencies, the difference would be even larger.

<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and national income?</h4>
At a cross-country level, the strongest predictor of healthcare spending is national income (you can find more about measures of national income in our <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a>). The following visualization presents evidence of this relationship. The correlation is striking: countries with a higher per capita income are much more likely to spend a larger share of their income on healthcare. In a seminal paper, Newhouse (1977)[ref]Newhouse, J.P. (1977), ‚ÄúMedical care expenditure: a cross-national survey‚Äù, Journal of Human Resources 12:115‚Äì125.[/ref] showed that aggregate income explains almost all of the variance in the level of healthcare expenditure (specifically, Newhouse (1977) showed that among a group of 13 developed countries, GDP per capita explained 92 percent of the variance in per capita health expenditure). Other studies have confirmed that this strong positive relationship remains after accounting for additional factors, such as country-specific demographic characteristics.[ref]Interestingly, there are important institutional variables that are also significantly correlated with healthcare expenditure after controlling for income. For example, the use of primary care ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù seems to result in lower health expenditure. And lower levels of health expenditure also appear to occur in systems where the patient first pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement, compared to other systems. For more information see page 46 in Culyer, A. J., &amp; Newhouse, J. P. (Eds.). (2000). <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FQCgxj_Ho_YC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Handbook+of+health+economics&amp;ots=fgypbKmLSP&amp;sig=B_JwMhjjvveLkGYjK6Ne3Q9Oyv4#v=onepage&amp;q=Handbook%20of%20health%20economics&amp;f=false">Handbook of health economics</a>. Elsevier.[/ref] Although in strict sense this result cannot be interpreted causally ‚Äì¬†since countries differ in many unobservable aspects that relate both to income and healthcare spending ‚Äì, more sophisticated econometric models dealing with the issue of 'omitted variables' seem to confirm that the effect of per capita GDP on expenditure is clearly positive and significant (for a technical discussion of this conclusion see Culyer and Newhouse (2000)).[ref]Culyer, A. J., &amp; Newhouse, J. P. (Eds.). (2000). <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FQCgxj_Ho_YC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Handbook+of+health+economics&amp;ots=fgypbKmLSP&amp;sig=B_JwMhjjvveLkGYjK6Ne3Q9Oyv4#v=onepage&amp;q=Handbook%20of%20health%20economics&amp;f=false">Handbook of health economics</a>.

<h3>The finances of healthcare </h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
In the preceding section we provide evidence supporting the fact that there are potentially large health returns to healthcare investments. Here we explore empirical evidence regarding how healthcare investments are financed around the world.

<em><strong>In depth information on healthcare expenditure and finances, including definitions and data sources, can be found in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">Financing Healthcare</a>.</strong></em>

<h4>When did high-income countries start expanding their healthcare systems?</h4>
The earliest data on financing of healthcare dates back to the late 19th century ‚Äì this is when many European countries began officially establishing healthcare systems through legislative acts. The following visualization presents public expenditure on healthcare as a percent of GDP for a selection of high-income countries for the period 1880-1994 using data from Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000)[ref]Tanzi, Vito, and Ludger Schuknecht. <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kHl6xCgd3aAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Public+spending+in+the+20th+century:+A+global+perspective&amp;ots=WhdEEdxaWN&amp;sig=XJsyIdSA8C2cD-wqOFVrBCtuaY4#v=onepage&amp;q=Public%20spending%20in%20the%2020th%20century%3A%20A%20global%20perspective&amp;f=false">Public spending in the 20th century: A global perspective</a>. Cambridge University Press, 2000 [/ref] and Lindert (1994)[ref]Lindert, Peter H. "The rise of social spending, 1880-1930." Explorations in Economic History 31, no. 1 (1994): 1-37.[/ref]. We've included eight countries for reference, but you can add other countries to the same chart by clicking on the corresponding option. As it can be appreciated, public expenditure on healthcare in all of these countries followed roughly similar paths; and this is despite early differences in their healthcare regimes (for a detailed account of the institutional evolution of healthcare regimes in these countries see the <a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Social-Policy/Health/Organisational-Structure/DR4-04-ev-HC-ref.html">report prepared by CESifo DICE</a>).

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-expenditure-on-healthcare-as-share-of-national-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>How quickly can healthcare coverage expand?</h4>
As noted above, european countries pioneered the expansion of healthcare systems in the first half of the twentieth century. The following visualization, from the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2014-human-development-report.html">Human Development Report (2014)</a>, places the achievements of these countries in perspective. Specifically, the following graph plots healthcare protection coverage for a selection of countries during the period 1920-2010. As we can see, France, Austria and Germany increased healthcare coverage in the years 1920-1960, while Spain, Portugal and Greece did it later, in the years 1960-1980. Interestingly, however, this graph also shows some notable examples of countries that expanded healthcare coverage much later, but much more quickly. In particular, China, Rwanda and Vietnam built health protection systems in the 21st century, almost from scratch, achieving near universal coverage in only a decade. These examples show that healthcare protection can be expanded very quickly, and not only at low baseline levels of coverage.
<h6>Evolution of health protection coverage as a percentage of total population, selected countries ‚Äì Figure 4.2 in the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2014-human-development-report.html">Human Development Report (2014)</a>[ref]The source given for the data corresponds to Figure 1 in ILO, (2011), Social Protection Floor for a Fair and Inclusive Globalization.

<h4>Has aggregate global expenditure on healthcare increased in the last couple of decades?</h4>
In the last two decades total aggregate global expenditure on healthcare has been relatively stable, albeit with a slow steady increase. The following visualization uses data from the World Health Organisation (published in the World Development Indicators) to show this. Total healthcare spending as a percent of GDP has seen an overall increase of roughly 1.5 perceptual points over the last two decades, with a relatively constant share of resources coming from the public sector.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-health-expenditure-as-share-of-global-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>How has healthcare expenditure evolved across different countries?</h4>
Global trends in healthcare expenditure mask a great deal of heterogeneity. The following map shows how total expenditure on healthcare has changed across the world. Clicking on the 'chart' tab in this visualization allows you to plot country-specific series. Although trends are not very pronounced for most countries, there are clear exceptions (e.g. Ecuador). And there are strong differences in levels.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-healthcare-expenditure-as-share-of-national-gdp-by-country?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

World-wide cross-country data also shows that, while the public share of resources used to finance healthcare has been stable in the aggregate, there is substantial underlying heterogeneity in this respect. The first visualization below presents public spending on healthcare as a share of total healthcare spending by country (again, with our usual 'chart' and 'map' views) ‚Äì it shows large differences even among relatively homogeneous industrialized market economies. The second visualization presents the same variable (public spending on healthcare as a share of total healthcare) but aggregating countries by income levels (World Bank classification) ‚Äì this shows that there have been substantial underlying shifts across regions. More specifically, in countries in the low-income and upper-middle-income brackets, there has been a marked increase in the share of public resources used to finance healthcare; in high-income countries there is no clear trend.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-public-expenditure-on-healthcare-by-country?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-expenditure-on-healthcare-by-country-income-groups" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>How important is out-of-pocket spending around the world?</h4>
In many countries an important part of the private funding for healthcare takes the form of 'out-of-pocket' spending. This refers to direct outlays made by households, including gratuities and in-kind payments, to healthcare providers. The following visualization presents out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare by country (as percent of total healthcare expenditure). As it can be seen, in high-income countries these outlays tend to account for only a small fraction of expenditure on healthcare (e.g. France, where the share was always below 8% in the entire series 1995-2013); while in low-income countries, they account for the majority of funding (e.g. Afghanistan, where the share of out-of-pocket expenditure reached 87.7% in 2002). Many countries have followed a clear path in the direction of reducing this type of expenditures (particularly in the developing world), yet some countries have moved in the opposite direction (Russia is a notable case in point, with a threefold increase in the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in the last decade).

<h3>Public policy and regulation</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
Public policy has the scope for affecting health outcomes. We provide here some evidence regarding effective healthcare regulatory policies in two different contexts: health insurance, and vaccinations.

<em><strong>Further in-depth information can be found in our entries dedicated to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination/">Vaccination</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases/">Eradication of Disease</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/">Healthcare Finances</a>.</strong> </em>

<h4>The Affordable Care Act in the US is improving healthcare coverage</h4>
In June 2012 the US introduced the Affordable Care Act (ACA) ‚Äì a legal reform aiming to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of healthcare.[ref]See <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjevoice/v_3a7_3ay_3a2010_3ai_3a5_3an_3a1.htm"> White, C. (2010). The health care reform legislation: an overview. The Economists' Voice, 7(5)</a> for a non-specialist overview of the ACA‚Äôs major provisions, their logic, and the federal budgetary implications. [/ref] This was, to a great extent, motivated by the fact that the share of uninsured individuals in the US is large and has remained virtually constant during decades of substantial growth in expenditure. The following visualization shows the percentage of individuals in the US without health insurance for the period 1963-2015. As we can see there are two marked changes in the trends separated by a long period of remarkable stability: there is a sharp drop in the number of uninsured in 1965 with the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, then relatively little change for decades, and then another sharp drop in 2012 with the introduction of the ACA. Disaggregated data shows that those states that decided to expand their Medicaid programs saw larger reductions in their uninsured rates from 2013 to 2015, especially when those states had large uninsured populations to start with (see <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2533698">Obama (2016)</a>.[ref] Obama, B. (2016). United States health care reform: progress to date and next steps. JAMA. [/ref] for further discussion of these figures). While strictly speaking this is only descriptive evidence ‚Äì we cannot know what would have happened to the trends without the introduction of the ACA ‚Äì, it seems reasonable to assume that the observed improvements in healthcare coverage are indeed a consequence of the ACA.

<h4>Vaccination campaigns improve the incidence and burden of diseases</h4>
The rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea and causes 527,000 childhood deaths annually (2011 estimates). Many more become sick and are hospitalized.[ref]Both the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus">virus</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus_vaccine">vaccine</a> are described in Wikipedia[/ref] Mexico introduced the rotavirus vaccination between 2006 and 2007, and the following graph shows how quick and successful the countrywide vaccination was. According to the study, diarrhea mortality for children under the age of 5 fell by 56% over three years.

The graph shows the seasonal pattern of the disease and how the lifesaving effect of the vaccine affected different age groups.

Data comparing the prevalence of diseases before and after the introduction of different vaccinations in the US can be found in Roush and Murphy (2007)[ref]Roush and Murphy (2007), Historical comparisons of morbidity and mortality for vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. Journal of the American Medical Association, 298, 18, 2155-2163.[/ref]. Below we provide a table summarizing their findings. As it can be seen, in most cases the reduction of cases has been close to 100%.

<h4>Vaccination campaigns can eradicate diseases</h4>
Today smallpox is a disease of the past. The following map shows when smallpox was eradicated from each country. Parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Brazil were the last places to have smallpox eradicated. But smallpox was eradicated from other parts of the world, especially Europe, far earlier. This suggests that slow eradication in some parts of the world was due primarily to weaker control systems¬†and ineffective vaccination strategies.
<h6>Year in which smallpox ceased to be endemic in each country ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
I have taken the data from a series of maps in chapter 8 in F. Fenner, D. A. Henderson, I. Arita, Z. Jezek, I. D. Ladnyi (1988) ‚Äì <em>Smallpox and its Eradication</em>. World Health Organization (WHO) 1988. The book is online <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf">here at the WHO website</a>.

The only data not taken from the maps but from the text are the data for Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand: For Canada the authors reported that ‚Äúendemic smallpox was eliminated by 1944‚Äù, for the USA only that it was eliminated ‚Äúthe latter half of the 1940s‚Äù (I chose 1948 for the visualization). Dates for the last outbreaks of smallpox in Australia (1917) and New Zealand (1914) are reported in the text ‚Äì in both countries smallpox has always been rare.
The dates for Madagascar and Namibia are not exactly known ‚Äì the authors only report that smallpox was eradicated in Madagascar before 1918 and for Namibia before 1955 (so I chose these years for eradication).
Countries are shown in their current borders ‚Äì successor countries of Yugoslavia, the USSR and the Sudan are assigned the eradication date of these states: 1925 for Yugoslavia, 1936 for the USSR, and 1972 for the Sudan.[/ref]

<!--------------DATA QUALITY + SOURCES-------------------------->
<h2>Main data sources</h2>
The World Development Indicators (WDI), published by the World Bank, are the main source of up-to-date cross-country data on life expectancy, child mortality and maternal mortality. Other more specialised data sources are listed and discussed in our entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/#data-sources">Life Expectancy</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/#data-sources">Child Mortality.</a>

The main source of data on international healthcare expenditure is the World Health Organisation (WHO), more specifically the <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database">global health expenditure database</a>.

Trust is a fundamental element of social capital ‚Äì a key contributor to sustaining well-being outcomes, including economic development. In this entry we discuss available data on trust, as measured by attitudinal survey questions; that is, estimates from surveys asking about trusting attitudes.

Global comparisons of trust attitudes around the world today suggest very large time-persistent cross-country heterogeneity. In one extreme, in countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, more than 60% of respondents in the World Value Survey think that people can be trusted. And in the other extreme, in countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru, less than 10% think that this is the case.

Data from European countries shows that average trust in the police tends to be higher than trust in the political and the legal systems. And trust in the political system is particularly low ‚Äì in fact much lower than interpersonal trust for all countries except Switzerland. On the other hand, trust in the police is notably high, and in the majority of European countries people trust the police more than they trust each other.

Long-run data from the US, where the General Social Survey (GSS) has been gathering information about trust attitudes since 1972, suggests that people trust each other less today than 40 years ago. This decline in interpersonal trust in the US has been coupled with a long-run reduction in public trust in government ‚Äì according to estimates compiled by the Pew Research Center since 1958, today trust in the government in the US is at historically low levels.

Interpersonal trust attitudes correlate strongly with religious affiliation and upbringing. Some studies have shown that this strong positive relationship remains after controlling for several survey-respondent characteristics.[ref]Guiso, L., Sapienza, P., &amp; Zingales, L. (2006). <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/jep/2006/00000020/00000002/art00002">Does culture affect economic outcomes?</a>. The journal of economic perspectives, 20(2), 23-48.[/ref] This, in turn, has led researchers to use religion as a proxy for trust, in order to estimate the extent to which economic outcomes depend on trust attitudes. Estimates from these and other studies using an instrumental-variable approach, suggest that trust has a causal impact on economic outcomes.[ref]Algan, Y., &amp; Cahuc, P. (2010). <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yann_Algan/publication/226641179_Inherited_Trust_and_Growth/links/02bfe50d0a0f6b8a6c000000.pdf">Inherited trust and growth</a>. The American Economic Review, 100(5), 2060-2092.[/ref] This suggests that the remarkable cross-country heterogeneity in trust that we observe today, can explain a significant part of the historical differences in cross-country income levels.

Measures of trust from attitudinal survey questions remain the most common source of data on trust. Yet academic studies have shown that these measures of trust are generally weak predictors of actual trusting behaviour. Interestingly, however, questions about trusting attitudes do seem to predict <em>trustworthiness</em>. In other words, people who say they trust other people tend to be trustworthy themselves.[ref]Glaeser, E. L., Laibson, D. I., Scheinkman, J. A., &amp; Soutter, C. L. (2000). <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4481497/Laibson_MeasuringTrust.pdf?sequence">Measuring trust</a>. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 811-846.[/ref]

<!--------------Cross-Country-------------->
<h3>Cross-country surveys</h3>
<h4>How do countries around the world compare in terms of interpersonal trust?</h4>
The World Value Survey allows cross-country comparisons of self-reported trust attitudes. The following visualization shows estimates of the share of survey respondents agreeing with the statement "most people can be trusted".[ref]To be precise, respondents are asked <em>"Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?" </em>. Possible answers include "Most people can be trusted", "Don't Know" and "Can't be too careful". We report figures of "Most people can be trusted" as a share of all answers. [/ref]  Countries can be added by clicking on the option at the top of the chart.

As it can be seen, there are very large differences in levels, and trends tend to be fairly stable. For example, in China the share of people reporting to trust others is much higher than in Brazil ‚Äì and this have been true across several surveys over the last couple of decades.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/self-reported-trust-attitudes" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Using the same data discussed above, the following map shows a global picture of cross-country differences in trust levels. Here, estimates correspond to the latest available data from the World Value Survey. Once again, heterogeneity stands out. In one extreme, in countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, more than 60% of respondents think that people can be trusted. And in the other extreme, in countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru, less than 10% think that this is the case. Notice that even in some relatively homogeneous regions, such as Western Europe, there are some marked differences: there is a twofold difference between France and neighbouring Germany.

<h4>How large are cross-country differences in estimates of interpersonal trust in Europe?</h4>
The results from the World Value Survey discussed above show that there are very large, time-persistent cross-country differences in the share of people who report trusting others, even within European countries. But are these cross-country differences similarly large if we look at average ratings of trust in a scale that allows for differences in intensity? The following visualization shows the average rating of trust in others across European countries, using data from Eurostat. In this case, respondents answer to the question "would you say that most people can be trusted?" using an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 to 10. As it can be seen, results are consistent ‚Äì countries with high interpersonal trust in the World Value Survey also have high trust ratings in the Eurostat survey. Yet heterogeneity on the more granular scale used by Eurostat is somewhat smaller.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-rating-of-trust-in-others-selected-countries" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>How much do people in developed countries trust public institutions?</h4>
The OECD, using Eurostat data, provides estimates of trust in public institutions that are comparable to estimates of 'trust in others' (i.e. interpersonal trust). The following visualization, taken from the OECD report <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/how-s-life-2015_how_life-2015-en">How's life? (2015) </a>, shows average ratings of trust in (i) the political system, (ii) the police, and (iii) the legal system. These figures can be directly compared to those on interpersonal trust discussed in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-rating-of-trust-in-others-selected-countries">visualization above</a>. In both cases figures rely on Eurostat data from the same survey, so respondents here also rate trust in institutions using an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 to 10. As it can be seen, average trust in the police tends to be higher than trust in the political and the legal systems. And trust in the political system is particularly low ‚Äì in fact much lower than interpersonal trust for all countries except Switzerland

The data suggests a broad correlation between trust in others, and trust in the different public institutions. Specifically, northern Europe (and Switzerland) report higher levels of trust, while southern and eastern Europe (and France) report lower levels across the board.
<h6>Mean trust in public institutions, European countries, 2013 ‚Äì Figure 3.14 in the OECD report <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/how-s-life-2015_how_life-2015-en">How's life?

<h4>People in most European countries trust the police more than they trust each other</h4>
We mentioned above that the police is trusted more than other public institutions in most European countries. But do people in these countries trust the police more than they trust each other? This question is relevant, because trust in the police can become, in certain situations, an important substitute for interpersonal trust. The following visualization plots Eurostat figures for trust in the police (y-axis) and trust in others (x-axis). The size of each dot represents national income (PPP-adjusted GDP per capita). We can see that there is a clear positive correlation; and in the majority of countries people report the same or higher trust in the police than trust in others. The clear exceptions are Greece, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Slovenia ‚Äì these are the countries that lie significantly below a hypothetical line with slope one (i.e. the line below which trust in others is higher than trust in the police). Denmark and the Netherlands, both with higher levels of trust than the mentioned countries, are also somewhat below this hypothetical line.

<h4>Trust in OECD governments has been going down in recent years</h4>
From an inter-temporal perspective, the data from the Gallup World Poll suggests that trust in public institutions has been going down recently in OECD countries. The following visualization shows the OECD-average estimate of trust in governments over the period 2006-2014, using Gallup's data. As it can be seen, the percentage of the population reporting confidence in the national government went down every year in the period 2009-2013.

<h3>Country-specific surveys</h3>

<h4>In the US, trust in the federal government is at historically low levels</h4>
The Pew Research Center recently constructed a series of long-run estimates of trust in the government for the US, staring 1958. The following visualization uses their data, to plot the share of people who say they can trust the government in Washington always or most of the time.[ref]The survey asked the question "How much of the time do you think you can trust the government in Washington to do what is right?" Answers included "Just about always", "Most of the time", or "Only some of the time".[/ref] As it can be seen there are some clear patterns associated with political cycles, but in the long-run there is a negative trend. Today, trust in the government in the US is at historically low levels. The Pew Research Center has a <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/11/23/public-trust-in-government-1958-2015/">dedicated website</a>, with many interesting visualizations ‚Äì including disaggregated trends by ethnicity and political affiliation.

<h4>In the US, people trust each other less now than 40 years ago</h4>
In the US, the General Social Survey (GSS) has been gathering information about trust attitudes since 1972. To our knowledge, this is the longest available time-series on interpersonal trust estimates in the world. The following visualization uses this source to show the evolution of trust in the US. Specifically, this plot shows the share of respondents agreeing with the statement "most people can be trusted" in the surveys 1972-2014.[ref]To be precise, respondents are asked <em>"Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?"</em>. Available replies are "Can trust", "Cannot trust", "Depends" and "Don't Know". We report figures of "Can trust" as a share of all answers. [/ref] As we can see, there are short-term fluctuations, but people in the US seem to trust each other less today than 40 years ago.

<h4>In the UK, trust in others has remained relatively stable over the last couple of decades ‚Äì but other measures of social capital have not </h4>

Trust is a key element of social capital ‚Äì but it is not the only one. Data from the UK suggests that different aspects of social capital change in time at different rates. The following chart, from the <a href="http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk">Centre for Social Investigation</a> at Nuffield College, Oxford, shows that in the UK trust in other people fluctuates year by year, but there is no trend over the last couple of decades. This is consistent with the figures from the World Value Survey, where the UK shows little variation between the 1998 and 2009 surveys. Interestingly, however, associations with voluntary organisations declined significantly over the same period ‚Äì the chart shows that the percentage of the UK population that is active with one or more organization fell from 52% in 1993 to 43% in 2012.

<h4>In Sweden, trust is not only very high, but also remarkably stable</h4>
The data from Eurostat and the World Value Survey shows that Sweden is one of the countries with the highest levels of trust globally. The following visualization from the <a href="http://som.gu.se">SOM institute</a> ‚Äì an independent survey research organisation at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden ‚Äì, shows that interpersonal trust in Sweden is not only high, but also very stable across time. 

In this visualisation we see the degree of trust in others, raging from 0 to 10. We can see that estimates are very persistent ‚Äì the share of individuals rating trust as low (0-3), medium (4-6) and high (7-10) has not changed significantly over the last two decades.

<h6>Trust in people, Sweden, 1996-2015 ‚Äì Page 20 in SOM (2015)[ref]SOM report Swedish Trends 1986-2015, available online at <a href="http://som.gu.se/digitalAssets/1581/1581024_swedish-trends-1986-2015.pdf">http://som.gu.se/digitalAssets/1581/1581024_swedish-trends-1986-2015.pdf</a>[/ref]  </h6>

The data from the SOM in Sweden also allows an inter-temporal analysis of other measures of trust. The following visualization shows estimates of general trust in politicians. In this case stability is reflected in the fact that political cycles are not associated with accentuated fluctuations. This seems to contrast with the data from the US, where public trust in government seems to be highly cyclical.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</h2>
<h3>Trust and culture</h3>
<h4>Do trust attitudes correlate with religion?</h4>
A number of academic studies have explored the link between religious beliefs and self-reported trust attitudes. The following figure, from Guiso et al. (2006)[ref]Guiso, L., Sapienza, P., &amp; Zingales, L. (2006). <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/jep/2006/00000020/00000002/art00002">Does culture affect economic outcomes?</a>. The journal of economic perspectives, 20(2), 23-48.[/ref], summarizes the results from one such study using data from the World Values Survey. Specifically, the bars in this figure represent the effect of religious affiliation on trust, in percent of the sample mean of trust relative to "no religious affiliation". The reported effects correspond to estimated coefficients in a regression where the dependent variable is trust in others (i.e. a variable equal to 1 if participants report that most people can be trusted), and there are controls for demographic characteristics (health, gender, age, education, social class, income). Since the data is available for the same country over several years, the authors also control for country-specific time-invariant characteristics (the so-called country fixed effects).

Taking these results at face value, the reported effects suggest that being raised religiously raises the level of trust by 2.6 percent; and regularly attending religious services (the author's definition of being "religious" for the purpose of the figure), raises the level of trust by another 20 percent. Similarly, these results suggest that the effect of religion differs across denominations: self-reported Catholic and Protestant religious affiliation has a positive effect on trust; while Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist affiliation does not.

As usual, these results have to be interpreted with caution, since reported figures do not control for unobservable time-varying factors that may simultaneously affect attitudes towards religion and trust; in other words, it is likely that there are unaccounted sources of bias that undermine the causal interpretation of the coefficients. Indeed, other studies using attitudinal survey questions on trust have found different results. For instance, Alesina and La Ferrara (2000)[ref]Alesina, A., &amp; Ferrara, E. L. (2000). The determinants of trust (No. w7621). National bureau of economic research. Available online from <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6715665.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6715665.pdf</a>[/ref] use data from the General Social Survey in the US, and find that religious affiliation is not statistically related to trust after controlling for further characteristics, such as whether survey respondents had a history of traumatic experiences.
<h6>Effect of religious affiliation on trust relative to no religious affiliation ‚Äì Figure 1 in Guiso et al. (2006)[ref]Reported effects correspond to estimated coefficients in a regression where the dependent variable is trust in others (i.e. a variable equal to 1 if participants report that most people can be trusted), and there are controls for demographic characteristics (health, gender, age, education, social class, income). The underlying source of the data used for the regressions is the European Values Survey and World Values Survey 1981‚Äì84, 1990‚Äì93, 1995‚Äì97.

<h3>Trust and economic outcomes</h3>
<h4>What is the relationship between trust and GDP?</h4>
In a much cited article, Arrow (1972)[ref]Arrow, K. J. (1972). Gifts and exchanges. Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs, 343-362.[/ref] says that "Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust, certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time."

The extent to which trust is linked to economic development has been the subject of many academic papers in the economics literature on growth (see Guiso et al. 2006[ref]Guiso, L., Sapienza, P., &amp; Zingales, L. (2006). <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/jep/2006/00000020/00000002/art00002">Does culture affect economic outcomes?</a>. The journal of economic perspectives, 20(2), 23-48.[/ref], Algan and Cahuc 2010[ref]Algan, Y., &amp; Cahuc, P. (2010). <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yann_Algan/publication/226641179_Inherited_Trust_and_Growth/links/02bfe50d0a0f6b8a6c000000.pdf">Inherited trust and growth</a>. The American Economic Review, 100(5), 2060-2092.[/ref], and the references therein). A common way to get a first-order approximation of this relationship is to estimate the correlations between trust and GDP per capita. The visualization below provides evidence of this correlation, by plotting trust estimates from the World Value Survey against GDP per capita. Each dot on this scatter-plot corresponds to a different country. You can learn more about measures of national income in our <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a>.

As it can be seen, there is a very strong positive relationship. Most academic studies find that this relationship remains after controlling for further characteristics. And similar results can also be obtained by looking at other measures of economic outcomes. Looking at outcomes across individuals, Guiso et al. (2006), for instance, report that trust has a positive and statistically significant correlation with the probability of becoming an entrepreneur, even after controlling for education, age and individual income. Their results also hold if religious affiliation of the respondents' ancestors is used as a proxy for trust ‚Äì they thus argue that, since ancestors' religion correlates with respondents' trust attitudes, this instrumental variable approach can be taken as evidence that the estimated relationship goes in the suggested direction (i.e. that trust <em>leads</em> to entrepreneurship, rather than the other way around).

Other studies using instrumental variables have also found similarly large effects. Algan and Cahuc (2010)[ref]Algan, Y., &amp; Cahuc, P. (2010). <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yann_Algan/publication/226641179_Inherited_Trust_and_Growth/links/02bfe50d0a0f6b8a6c000000.pdf">Inherited trust and growth</a>. The American Economic Review, 100(5), 2060-2092.[/ref] predict that, according to their estimates, African countries would have a five-fold increase in GDP per capita if they had the same level of inherited social attitudes as Sweden, after controlling for lagged GDP per capita, contemporaneous political environment and time-invariant country characteristics.

Algan and Cahuc (2010) show that inherited trust of descendants of US immigrants is significantly influenced by the country of origin and the timing of arrival of their forebears. This is their instrumental variable: the inherited trust of descendants of US immigrants is used as a time-varying measure of inherited trust in the country of origin. This approach allows the authors to control for country fixed effects and interpret the effect of trust on growth <em>causally</em>. You can read a summary of their findings and approach in a <a href="http://voxeu.org/article/trust-and-economic-development">voxeu.org article written by the researchers</a>.

Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/41408736[/ref] provide evidence to explain mistrust in Africa: they show that current differences in trust levels within Africa can be traced back to the transatlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades. More specifically, they show that individuals whose ancestors were heavily raided during the slave trade are less trusting today ‚Äì and using a variety of different econometric strategies, they claim that this relationship is causal.

<h4>What is the relationship between trust and income inequality?</h4>
Cross-country data, as well as within-country data, suggest that economic inequality is negatively related to trust. The following visualization provides evidence of this relationship: it shows a scatter plot of trust estimates from the World Value Survey against income inequality measured by the Gini index. Each dot on this scatter-plot corresponds to a different country, with colors representing different world regions and dot sizes representing population. A Gini index of 0 reflects perfect equality, so the observed negative correlation in this graph implies that higher inequality is associated with lower trust. In other words, we can see that countries with higher income inequality also tend to report lower levels of trust. You can read more about income inequality and the Gini index in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">income inequality</a>.

This negative relationship can be explained through various mechanisms: social ties may imply that people are more willing to trust those who are similar to themselves, or higher inequality may lead to conflicts over resources. The empirical work from Alesina and La Ferrara (2000)[ref]Alesina, A., &amp; Ferrara, E. L. (2000). The determinants of trust (No. w7621). National bureau of economic research. Available online from <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6715665.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6715665.pdf</a>[/ref] provides evidence in support of the former mechanism.

Working Paper Series 715, Research Institute of Industrial Economics.[/ref] provides a discussion of these and other possible mechanisms.

<h3>Trust and social outcomes</h3>
<h4>Is there a link between education and trust?</h4>
One of the reasons to justify government intervention in the market for education, is that education generates positive externalities.[ref]That positive externalities justify government intervention in the provision of education is essentially an efficiency argument. The logic is that individuals may not spend enough on education because they fail to internalize the positive effect that their education has on other people. But there are, of course, also equity arguments to justify government intervention in the provision of education ‚Äì for instance, reducing inequality in education may be of intrinsic value, or may be instrumental in reducing inequalities in other outcomes.[/ref] This essentially means that investing in education yields both private and social returns. Private returns to education include higher wages and better employment prospects (as we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/skill-premium-income-by-education/">Skill Premium</a>). Social return include pro-social behaviour (e.g. volunteering, political participation) and interpersonal trust.

The following chart uses OECD results from the Survey of Adult Skills to show how self-reported trust in others correlates with educational attainment. More precisely, this chart plots the percentage-point difference in the likelihood of reporting to trust others, by education level of respondents. Those individuals with upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education are taken as the reference group, so the percentage point difference is expressed in relation to this group. As we can see, in all countries those individuals with tertiary education were by far the group most likely to report trusting others.

And in almost every country, those with post-secondary non-tertiary education were more likely to trust others than those with primary or lower secondary education. The OECD's report <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a> provides similar descriptive evidence for other social outcomes. The conclusion is that adults with higher qualifications are more likely to report desirable social outcomes, including good or excellent health, participation in volunteer activities, interpersonal trust, and political efficacy. And these results hold after controlling for literacy, gender, age and monthly earnings.

For example, in Norway, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education reporting to trust others increases by 20 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education. Similarly, after accounting for literacy proficiency, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education increases by 16 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education."[/ref]</h6>

<h4>Trust and civic engagement go together with peaceful collective decision making</h4>
Social cohesion is often defined as the capacity of a country to support peaceful collective decision making. The following pair of plots, from the World Development Report (2013),[ref]<a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNWDR2013/Resources/8258024-1320950747192/8260293-1322665883147/WDR_2013_Report.pdf">World Development Report 2013: Jobs</a>. Washington, DC: World Bank. DOI: 10.1596/978-0-8213-9575-2. License: Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 3.0.[/ref] show the correlation between the index of peaceful collective decision making, and two key measures of social cohesion at the micro level: trust and civic engagement. The index of peaceful collective decision making is a quantitative indicator that, for each country, aggregates data on political stability, the absence of violence, and voice and accountability.

The figure shows a strong positive relationship: countries where people are more likely to report trusting others, are also countries where there is less violence and more political stability and accountability.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Measurement</h2>
<h4>How sensitive are estimates of interpersonal trust from attitudinal survey questions to changes in surveying methodologies?</h4>
Attitudinal survey questions provide the main source of data to estimate interpersonal trust attitudes. Available evidence for countries with multiple such estimates, suggest that results are robust to the specific surveying methodologies. The following scatter plot bears this out, by comparing cross-country estimates from different surveys. Specifically, this figure plots the estimated interpersonal trust levels as measured by the World Values Survey, against interpersonal trust levels as measured by the European Social Survey and the Afrobarometer Survey. The resulting correlation is positive and very high.

<h4>Do trust estimates from attitudinal survey questions predict trusting <em>behaviour</em>?</h4>
In an academic paper, Glaser et al. (2000)[ref]Glaeser, E. L., Laibson, D. I., Scheinkman, J. A., &amp; Soutter, C. L. (2000). <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4481497/Laibson_MeasuringTrust.pdf?sequence">Measuring trust</a>. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 811-846.[/ref] examine the predictive power of two types of survey questions: questions about trusting attitudes and questions about past trusting behavior. The authors examine the predictive power of these questions by comparing survey answers with actual trusting behaviour in an incentivised experimental setting with monetary rewards. They show that, while measures of past trusting behavior are better than the abstract attitudinal questions in predicting subjects' experimental choices, in general terms they are both weak predictors of trust. Interestingly, however, questions about trusting attitudes do seem to predict <em>trustworthiness</em>. In other words, people who say they trust other people tend to be trustworthy themselves.

Between 1900 and 2000 the increase in world population was three times greater than the entire previous history of humanity‚Äì an increase from 1.5 to 6.1 billion in just 100 years.

A picture of world population in the very long-run fits the pattern of exponential growth (when a population grows exponentially the rate of growth is proportional to the size of the population). Yet an empirical observation of how growth rates have developed in the course of the last century reveals that this pattern no longer holds. The annual rate of population growth has recently been going <em>down</em>. A long historical period of accelerated growth has thus come to an end; the annual world population growth rate peaked in 1962, at around 2.1%, and has come down to almost half since.[ref]US Census Bureau data on <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_population.php">'Total Midyear Population for the World: 1950-2050'</a>[/ref]

Based on these observations, world history can be divided into three periods marked by distinct trends in population growth. The first period (pre-modernity) was a very long age of very slow population growth. The second period, beginning with the onset of modernity (with rising standards of living and improving health) and lasting until 1962, had an increasing rate of growth. Now that period is over, and the third part of the story has begun; the population growth rate is falling and will likely continue to fall, leading to an end of growth towards the end of this century.

<!------------------------------------>
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<!--------------Overview-------------->

<h3>Key changes in population growth</h3>

In order to study how the world population changes over time it is useful to focus on the <em>rate</em> of change (rather than just levels). The following visualization presents the annual population growth rate, superimposed on the total world population, for the period 1750-2010 (plus projections up to 2100). This is the period in history when population growth changed most drastically. Before 1800 the world population growth rate never exceeded 0.5%, while in the course of the first fifty years of the 20th century it went from 0.8% to 2.1% ‚Äì the highest annual growth rate in history, recorded in 1962. After this point, it has been systematically going down with projections estimating an annual rate of growth of 0.06% for 2100. Since the rate of growth corresponds to the slope of the line tracing the total world population over time, this means that under these projections we should expect an inflection in growth around the year 2100. In other words, under the assumption that the population growth rate will continue falling more or less at the current pace, population will stop growing before the end of this century.

<!--------------Long-run (1) Big Picture -------------->
<h3>Long-run historical perspective: the big picture</h3>
Around 108 billion people have lived on our planet. This means that about 6.5% of all people ever born are alive right now.[ref]As per 2011 estimates from Carl Haub (2011), "<a href="http://quelux.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PRB_howManyPeopleHaveEverLivedOnEarth.pdf">How Many People Have Ever Lived on Earth?</a>" Population Reference Bureau.[/ref] The following visualization plots estimates of the world population, from a number of sources, for different periods in history. As it can be appreciated, before 1,000 CE the population slowly but steadily increased, going from about 4 million in 10,000 BCE to 265 million in 1,000 CE. This represents an average increase of only about 24,000 people per year. By 1850, the world population had exceeded 1 billion people. In the period 1000-1850 the population grew on average almost 1.5 million people per year‚Äîthis represents an average growth almost 60 times larger than that recorded for the period 10,000 BCE - 1000 CE.

<!--------------Long-run (2) Countries--------------></p>
<h3>Long-run historical perspective: country trends in the last 500 years</h3>

As has been already mentioned, for a long period of time (staring at the beginning of the 19th century and ending in the 1960s) total world population grew faster as the growth rate increased. This global pattern, however, masks a great deal of heterogeneity across countries; in reality growth started climbing at different points in time in each country. Data from the Clio Infra project allows a cross-country analysis. The following visualization shows total population by country in the last five centuries. Substantial differences are evident here: adding the U.S. to the graph reveals that, while the population in France roughly doubled in the period 1800-2000, in this same period the population in the U.S. increased almost 50-fold.

<!--------------Long-run (3) Regions-------------->
<h3>Long-run historical perspective: regional shares</h3>

Differences at the regional level are also important. The estimates provided by the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) allow a regional analysis for the period 1400-2000. The following visualization provides a break down of the world population by regions using this source (plus projections from the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/">UN Population Division</a>). China, India and Africa are (and have been for a long time) the most populous regions in the world ‚Äì and this is predicted to remain true by 2100. Yet in relative terms (click on the 'expanded' option in this chart) the share of the world's population living in India and Africa is predicted to continue increasing, while China's share is expected to decrease, likely due to falling <a title="Fertility Rates" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/fertility-rates/">fertility rates</a>.

<!--------------Recent Developments (1) Rates -------------->
<h3>Recent history and projections</h3>

In terms of recent developments, the data from the UN Population Division provides consistent and comparable estimates (and projections) within and across countries and time, over the last century. This data starts from estimates for 1950, and is updated periodically to reflect changes in fertility, mortality and international migration (for more information see the Data Quality section at the end of this entry).

The following visualization presents the rate of population growth by country for the period 1955-2015, plus projections for 2015-2100 using the UN Population Division data (switch to the map view in this chart for a wider cross-country comparison). As you can see, in most countries growth rates have been going down since the 1960s. Yet substantial differences remain across countries and regions. While Western Europe currently has close to zero annual growth rates, sub-Saharan Africa has rates that are still higher than 3% ‚Äì that is, still higher than the peak growth rates recorded for the world at the beginning of the 1960s. Moreover, in many cases there has been divergence in growth rates. For instance, India and Nigeria had similar growth rates in 1960 (around 1.7%), but followed very different paths in the following years, and currently have populations that grow at very different rates (about 1.26% for India compared to 2.67% for Nigeria).

<iframe src="/grapher/population-growth-rates" width="100%" height="660px"></iframe>

In the last century developed countries have had lower growth rates than developing countries. While some convergence is expected, large differences are projected to remain for the next century. The following visualization presents how the population growth rate has changed for 'more developed', 'less developed' and 'least developed' countries (UN categorization), together with the corresponding projections (UN Population Division estimates and projections from the 2012 revision).

The 'least developed countries' are a subgroup of the 'less developed countries' - The UN defines the regions as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>More developed regions comprise Europe, Northern America, Australia/New Zealand and Japan.</li>
 	<li>Less developed regions comprise all regions of Africa, Asia (excluding Japan), Latin America and the Caribbean plus Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.</li>
 	<li>The least developed countries are 48 countries, 33 in Africa, 9 in Asia, 5 in Oceania plus one in Latin America and the Caribbean.</li>

<!--------------Recent Developments (2) Density -------------->

The above discussion also shows there are interesting patterns of population density: the most densely populated regions today have also been the most dense regions throughout modern history. India is a prime example of this. The following visualization shows population density patterns by country using the data from the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE).

<h3>World population by education level</h3>

The <em>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</em> (IIASA) is an interdisciplinary, highly-respected research institution near Vienna, Austria. The IIASA population projections are the most cited alternative to the UN work.

Interestingly their medium projection ‚Äì which they consider most likely ‚Äì stands in stark contrast to the UN projection. While the medium variant of the UN projection sees the world population growing continuously throughout the 21st century the IIASA medium (most likely) scenario sees the world population increase to 9.4 billion in 2070 and then begin a slow decline to below 9 billion by the end of the century.

As the IIASA researchers explain there are <a href="https://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">important methodological differences</a> between the UN and IIASA projections. The UN uses probabilistic population projections to extrapolate populations for each country over the 21st century and is applying the same statistical methodology to all countries. The IIASA researchers in contrast have a country-specific approach that takes into account the knowledge of experts for each country separately.

The other important feature of the IIASA projection is that it takes into account the education of the population. As we show below in this entry there is a strong link between education and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">fertility</a> ‚Äì more educated women have fewer children. This link is taken into account in the model of the IIASA researchers and contributes to their projection of a much smaller total world population over the course of the 21st century.

The breakdown by education level is especially interesting: it shows that our world will be inhabited by more and more educated people. In the visualization below you see that in 1970 there were only around 700 million people in the world that had secondary or post-secondary education. By the end of this century the number of people with secondary or post-secondary education will have increased 10-fold and will reach 7 billion people (a similar number to the entire current world population)!

The projection also shows that the number of people with no education will decrease continuously and that by the end of this century virtually all people in the world will have received some level of education.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>

<h3>Fertility</h3>

Perhaps the most direct and obvious determinant of population growth is fertility. In the following visualization we show the rate of fertility, defined as the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if the woman were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates, and the woman were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life. This data comes from the UN Population Division. As we can see, fertility rates were stable across the world until the 1960s, with some differences in levels between 'developed' and 'developing' countries. After this point, fertility rates started dropping and levels began converging. This coincides with the decline in growth rates that has already been discussed. In the next section we explore the combined effects of changing fertility and mortality. You can read more about these factors in our <a href="/fertility-rates/">fertility</a> and <a href="/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> entries.

<h3>Demographic transition</h3>

The statistical office of Sweden - the <em>Tabellverket </em>(Office of Tables) - was established in 1749 when the Swedish population was 1,764,724; today it is more than five times higher (9,555,893 in 2012). This long record of population statistics makes Sweden a particularly interesting case to explore the mechanisms driving population changes.

Statistics Sweden - the successor of the <em>Tabellverket</em> - publishes data on both deaths and births since record-keeping began more than 250 years ago. These records suggest that around the year 1800 the death rate of the Swedes started falling, mainly due to improvements in health and living standards, especially for children.[ref]Before 1800 more than 20% of the Swedish babies died before they reached their first birthday, and of those who survived another 20% died before their 10th birthday (see Croix, Lindh, and Malmberg (2009), <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo_Malmberg/publication/24017084_Demographic_change_and_economic_growth_in_Sweden_1750-2050/links/0912f506992677b743000000.pdf">Demographic change and economic growth in Sweden: 1750‚Äì2050</a>. In Journal of Macroeconomics, 31, 1, 132--148).[/ref] Yet while death rates were falling, birth rates remained at a constant pre-modern level until the 1860s. During this period and up until the first half of the 20th century, there was a sustained gap between the frequency of deaths and the frequency of births. It was because of this gap that the population of the Swedes increased. The following visualization supports these observations.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/Demographic-Transition-Mitchell" style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

The expansion of the Swedish population, caused by the widening gap between mortality rates and birth rates, has been observed in many other countries ‚Äì and is the main explanation for increasing population in the world as a whole. It is a fundamental part of a model of demographic transition, which is synthesised in the graph below.

<h3>Health improvements</h3>

The high fertility of families in poor health environments is widely considered to be a consequence of families attempting to ensure that enough children survive. As health improves, families tend to adapt to the new situation by lowering their expectations of how many children to have. Better child health has thus two opposing effects on population growth. In the first instance, the effect of improving health is lower mortality ‚Äì a driver initially pushing population growth up. But later on health improvements result in lower fertility ‚Äì a driver pushing growth in the <em>opposite</em> direction.

Since virtually all countries in the world have already achieved historically low child mortality rates, it is natural to think that the latter effect currently dominates the global landscape. The following visualization presents the correlation between population growth and child mortality across the world. Indeed, countries with high child mortality rates tend to grow faster. This is important, since it suggests that health improvements are effective at curbing population growth ‚Äì and that, by the same token, failing to tackle child mortality may actually foster faster population growth.

<!--------------DATA QUALITY------------------------>
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Measurement</h2>

<!--------------(1) Long run------------------------>
<h3>Data on the population of the ancient world</h3>

Kremer (1993) provides estimates of the total world population over the last 1 million years.[ref]Michael Kremer (1993) "<a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/210a/readings/kremer1993.pdf">Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990</a>", Quarterly Journal of Economics., August 1993, pp.681-716.[/ref] He puts together UN estimates for the period 1920-1990, as well as estimates from McEvedy and Jones (1978)[ref]McEvedy, Colin and Richard Jones (1978), "Atlas of World Population History," Facts on File, New York, pp. 342-351.[/ref] for the period 10,000 BCE-1900 CE, and Deevey (1960)[ref]Deevey, Edward S. "The human population." Scientific American 203 (1960): 194-204.[/ref] for the period 1,000,000 BCE-10,000 BCE.

The estimates from McEvedy and Jones (1978) after 200 BCE were obtained by aggregating population estimates for individual geographic regions taken from other authors (see references therein), and these in turn were based primarily on historical sources such as Roman and Chinese censuses. Their estimates of population prior to 200BCE were based on archaeological and anthropological evidence.

Many studies not considered in Kremer (1993) provide competing estimates of world population over long historial periods (Kremer (1993) mentions Clark (1977)[ref]Clark, Colin (1997). "Population growth and land use." London: Macmillan.[/ref] and Durand (1977)[ref]Durand, John D. (1974), "<a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=psc_penn_papers">Historical Estimates of World Population: An Evaluation</a>," Population and Development Review III, 253-96. [/ref], but there are more). The following two graphs provide a sense of the dispersion of different estimates. All long-run estimates appear to be fairly close.

<!--------------(2) Recent------------------------>
<h3>Data quality of recent world population estimates</h3>

The most discussed estimates from the last century are those from the UN Population Division. These are revised periodically and aim to be consistent and comparable within and across countries and time.

The methodology used by the UN to produce their estimates and projections is discussed extensively in the World Population Prospects' <a href="http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Methodology.pdf">Methodology Report</a>. As noted in this report, estimates are produced "by starting with a base population by age and sex for 1 July 1950 and advancing the population through successive 5-year time intervals using the cohort-component method, based on age-specific estimates of the components of population change (fertility, mortality, and international migration)." Population counts by age and sex from periodic censuses are used as benchmarks.

The process of 'revising' the estimates involves incorporating new information about the demography of each country. The following diagram explains the process used to ensure consistency.

<h6>Process for generating UN population revisions ‚Äì Table I.4. in the UN World Population Prospects Methodology Report[ref] UN World Population Prospects <a href="http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Methodology.pdf">Methodology Report</a>[/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-7241"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7241" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-750x469.jpg" alt="UN Population Methodology" width="750" height="469" /></a>

The main implication of this cohort-component framework by demographic trends is that it sometimes leads to marked inconsistencies with official country statistics. The following map, showing the coverage of births through civil registration, speaks to this issue: many countries, particularly those in the least developed regions of the world, have limited census data. For countries with no data in one or two decades before each revision, UN estimates are derived by extrapolating trends from countries in the same region with a socio-economic profile considered close to the country in question.

<!--------------(3) Future------------------------>
<h3>Uncertainty of future projections</h3>

The most discussed projections of population growth are also those from the UN Population Division.[ref]There are other organizations working on population forecasts, such as the Austria-based <a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at">Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) </a>[/ref] Keilman (2001)[ref]Nico Keilman (2001), <a href="http://folk.uio.no/keilman/Popstudies3.pdf">Data quality and accuracy of United Nations population projections, 1950-95</a>. In Population Studies, 55, 2, 149--164.[/ref] provides an assessment of the forecasts of world population published by the UN between 1951 and 1998. This comparisons of projected versus actual population levels suggests that UN forecasts are fairly accurate. The following visualization shows this.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Population-Size-The-Estimates-of-the-Wold-Population-compared-with-the-UN-Forecasts-since-1950-Keilman-2001.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1414 size-full" title="" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Population-Size-The-Estimates-of-the-Wold-Population-compared-with-the-UN-Forecasts-since-1950-Keilman-2001.png" alt="World Population Size - The Estimates of the Wold Population compared with the UN Forecasts since 1950 - Keilman (2001)" width="642" height="501" /></a>

Since projecting fertility is a fundamental part of the forecasting exercise, future estimates are usually presented for different variants. The following visualization presents world population projections under different fertility assumptions. As you might expect, projections are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions made about fertility.

With the onset of industrialization and rising productive the share of people living in poverty started to decrease and kept on falling ever since. As a consequence of falling poverty, <a href="/child-mortality/">the health of the population improved dramatically</a> over the last two centuries, and the <a href="/world-population-growth/">population started to grow</a>. The growth of the population caused¬†the absolute number of poor people in the world to increase;¬†only over the last decades has¬†the absolute number of people living in poverty started to fall as well.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>What do poor people think about poverty?</h3>
More and more people have left¬†the extreme poverty of the past behind. But why should we care? Is it not the case that poor people might only have less income but enjoy their lives just as much ‚Äì or even more ‚Äì than rich people?

One way to find out is to simply ask, which is what the <em>Gallup Organization</em> did. In the World Poll the organization asked people around the world what they think about their standard of living ‚Äì not only about their income. The economist Angus Deaton[ref]Deaton (2010) ‚Äì <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/Deaton_Price_Indexes_Inequality_and_the_Measurement_of_World_Poverty_AER.pdf">Price Indexes, Inequality, and the Measurement of World Poverty</a>. In American Economic Review, 100, 1, 5--34.[/ref] compared the answers that people in different societies gave with the average income of these societies. This research is summarized in the following graph; it shows that people living in poverty are clearly less satisfied with their living standards in a broader sense.

This¬†is one way of seeing that economic prosperity is not an end in itself but a means for a better life. The correlation between rising incomes and happiness and higher life satisfaction¬†is shown in the <a href="/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/">entry on happiness</a>.

<h3>Poverty lines</h3>
The most straightforward way to measure poverty is to calculate the share of population living below a certain poverty line as the fraction of the total number of people in the society. But drawing the line between the poor and the rest is not easy. If you look at the previous graph, it is easy to understand why. It would be easy if there was a clear¬†delineation between people who were satisfied with their standard of living and people who aren't. This is not the case. We see, on the contrary, that having more income always improves the self-perceived living standard of the people.

The fact that higher income always improves the standards of living means that¬†defining poverty by drawing a line¬†is always rightly subject to debate. It is necessarily controversial to propose a line that separates those that are poor from those that 'merely' have a low income.

The World Bank, which¬†gathers data on income from people around the world, defined absolute poverty as living on less than¬†$1.90 per day. This is measured in international dollars (in prices of 2011) that are adjusted for the fact that people in different countries face different price levels (PPP adjustment). It is also expressed in real terms to adjust for price changes over time. (How these adjustments are made is explained in the <a href="/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a>.)
<h3>Share of the population below the international poverty line</h3>
The latest data on extreme poverty can be explored in the data visualization below. The map shows the distribution of global poverty and with the slider below the map you can explore the change over time.

You can also switch to the 'chart'-tab to see the change over time for individual countries or world regions.

<iframe src="/grapher/share-of-the-population-living-in-extreme-poverty?tab=map" width="100%" height="660px"></iframe>

$1.90 per day is a very low cut off ‚Äì the term extreme poverty is appropriate. It is therefore interesting to see the share living below a higher poverty line such as 3.10 international $ per day as in the following chart.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/187" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>200 years of¬†lifting the world out of poverty</h3>
The World Bank publishes data on absolute poverty from 1981 onwards, but researchers have tried to reconstruct information of the living standards of the more distant past. The seminal paper was written by¬†Bourguignon and Morrison in 2002 (for the reference see the following footnote) in which the two authors reconstructed measures of poverty as far back as 1820. The poverty line of 1.90 Int. Dollar per day was introduced in 2015 and the 2002 paper used the measure of 1$ per day that was used at the time. All of this information is presented in the following graph.

In 1820, the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty and only a tiny elite enjoyed higher standards of living. <a title="GDP Growth Over the Last Centuries" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-growth-over-the-last-centuries/">Economic growth over the last 200 years</a> completely transformed our world, and poverty fell continuously over the last two centuries. This is even more remarkable when we consider that the population increased 7-fold over the same time (which in itself is a consequence of increasing living standards and decreasing mortality ‚Äì especially of <a title="Infant Mortality" href="/infant-mortality/">infants</a> and <a title="Child Mortality" href="/child-mortality/">children</a> ‚Äì around the world). In a world without economic growth, an increase in the population would result in¬†less and less income for everyone, and a 7-fold increase would have surely resulted in a world in which everyone is extremely poor. Yet, the exact opposite happened. In a time of unprecedented¬†population growth we managed to lift more and more people out of poverty! Even in 1981 more than 50% of the world population lived in absolute poverty ‚Äì this is now down to about 14%. This is still a large number of people, but the change is happening incredibly fast. For our present world, the data tells us that poverty is now falling more quickly than ever before in world history. The first of the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml">Millenium Development Goals</a> set by the UN was to halve the population living in absolute poverty between 1990 and 2015. Rapid economic growth meant that this goal¬† ‚Äì arguably the most important ‚Äì was achieved (5 years ahead of time) in 2010.

There is also an <a href="/grapher/declining-global-poverty-share-1820-2015">interactive version of this visualization</a>.

<h3>The end of extreme poverty and economic growth</h3>
In 1820 only a few places in the world had achieved economic growth ‚Äì and only to a rather small extent. The progress of the last 200 years was achieved as economic growth brought higher incomes to more and more people in the world. The following graph shows the relation between average income and the share of the population that lives in extreme poverty. The share of people living in extreme poverty is smaller in richer countries, but some countries achieve to have a small share in extreme poverty even at low incomes.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/185" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

The scatter plot above¬†shows the cross sectional evidence of the link between economic prosperity and poverty. In the following graph we look at the relationship over time for Brazil. The country with a population of almost 200 million people achieved an average annual growth rate of 1.7% over the 20 years. Economic growth together with the expansion of the government's effort to redistribute to the country's poorest people, Brazil halved the share of people living in absolute poverty over this short period of time. Similarly to other industrializing countries, this reduced the income inequality (measured with the Gini coefficient) over this period.

<h3>Beyond income -¬†poverty in other dimensions</h3>
So far we have only looked at poverty in terms of low productivity and low income. There is good reason to regard these measures as extremely important (the first graph shows the importance to the people living in poverty). But income is a means to an end and not an end in itself. Other measures of poverty look at the ends itself and study progress in terms of extending education, improving health and psychological wellbeing, and human rights and violence. These measures do not only look at work as a source of income but at the safety and quality of the work itself.

The¬†<a href="http://www.ophi.org.uk/">Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative</a> publishes reports on the changes of poverty measured with multidimensional poverty indices. Their research supports the idea that <a href="http://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/mpi-2013/">we are¬†progressing¬†towards a world with fewer and fewer¬†poor people</a>. They also have a great tool to <a href="http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/MPI2013/web/StatPlanet.html">visualize their research results on a world map</a>.
<h3>Poverty by world regions ‚Äì in absolute numbers</h3>
We have seen that back in 1820 the majority of our ancestors lived¬†in extreme poverty. Poverty back then and for¬†the many millennia previous¬†was equally prevalent in all parts of the world. Economic growth then started to lift the early industrialized countries out of poverty, and absolute poverty disappeared there. I think it is important to notice how very recent this development is even in the rich countries of the world.

Inequality is often the consequence of unequal progress. Poverty is a good example of this. The early progress in some countries and the stagnation in others meant that poverty has largely decreased in some countries and was still as widespread as ever in other countries. With industrialization and economic growth catching on in more and more regions around the world, the standards of living have increased in these countries. Poverty remains in those regions in which the accumulated economic growth is still small and industrialization still at the early stages.

The recent decrease of poverty is shown in the following graph;¬†the graph is now showing the absolute number of poor people. We see that the Americas and Europe left poverty behind before 1981. Over the last thirty years large parts of East Asia and the Pacific achieved rapid economic growth and this meant that poverty has been rapidly decreasing there.

<h3>Poverty by world regions ‚Äì as the share of the population</h3>
In the following graph one can study the declining share of the poor population by continent. Probably the most outstanding achievement is the reduction of poverty in East Asia and Pacific. The reduction from 77% to 12% is especially important as it is a very populous part of the world.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/186" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h3>The distribution of poverty in the world today</h3>
From the charts above we have seen that around 1 billion people live in extreme poverty today. Where do these poorest people live?

Number of people in extreme poverty by continent:[ref]I have calculated these figures based on the data on the share of people in extreme poverty (downloaded in August 2015).

Incomes are adjusted for the different price levels and are expressed in ppp-adjusted 2005 International Dollars. The each country I have used the latest available data from the time 2005 to 2012.

The population figures were taken from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a> and refer to the latest available year (2013).[/ref]
<ul>
 	<li>551 Million in Asia</li>
 	<li>436 Million in Africa</li>
 	<li>15 Million in South America</li>
 	<li>5.9 Million in North America</li>
 	<li>0.3 Million in Europe</li>
 	<li>50 Thousand in Oceania</li>
</ul>
The following map ‚Äì using the new poverty line of 1.90$ in 2011 PPPs ‚Äì gives an answer to the question for every country in the developing world. The share of people in poverty is highest in Madagascar (82%), the Democratic Republic of Congo (77%) and Burundi (78%). In India 21% of the population live in poverty and in China 11%.

<h3>The Poverty Gap is falling globally</h3>
The main measure shown before is the poverty headcount which is simply the share of people with incomes or consumption below a certain poverty poverty line, in this case the international poverty line. This measure is easy to understand, but it has disadvantages: With this measure, a person that earns only 0.5 international-$ and a person that earns 1.89 international-$ per day are both called extremely poor. It would make sense to not only capture the fact that an income is below the poverty line, it would also make sense to measure how far below the poverty line this income is. This is what the poverty gap does.

In contrast with the poverty headcount, the poverty gap takes the <em>intensity of poverty</em> into account. It takes into account that poverty is more severe in a place and time where many people live on 0.5 international-$ rather than 1.89 international-$.

The poverty gap is the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is explained in more detail <a href="http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx?IndicatorId=2">here at the web page of the UN</a>. The issue of course with the poverty gap measure is that it is not as straightforward to explain as the poverty headcount and for public discussions it is therefore rarely used (but it should!).

The visualisation below shows the poverty gap for the international poverty line of 1.90 international-$ per day. You can add other countries to the chart or switch to the map view.

The World Bank is the most important institution measuring the extent of global poverty. This poverty data is published via <a href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/">Povcal Net</a> and also in the World Development Indicators.

The word 'poverty' is used in 2 distinct meanings in social research. Not distinguishing between these difference causes confusion when comparing poverty across time and across countries.¬†<strong>Absolute poverty</strong> (or extreme poverty) is measured relative to a fixed standard of living that is consistent over time and between countries. Global poverty figures aim to count the number of people who are destitute by a common global standard. <strong>Relative Poverty</strong> on the other hand is measured relative to the living standards in a particular society and varies both over time and between societies as the living standards in change, it is therefore related to the level and the <a href="/income-inequality/">inequality</a> of living standards in a particular society at a particular point in time.
<h3>Data availability</h3>
The World Bank is by far the most important source of data on poverty. But the coverage is surely not as good as one would hope. A measure of data availability is to see how many surveys on which poverty measures are based are available for each country. This data quality measure is shown in the map below.
For all countries that are shown in grey there is not a single survey available at the World Bank in the last 3 decades. Many of these countries are rich countries in which the the share of people in extreme poor people is very low. But for some poorer countries in which surely a considerable share of the population is living in extreme poverty estimates would be very useful.
Secondly, for some countries there are only very few observations. Even in the last decade there is unfortunately often only one survey available for many African countries. On the other hand the coverage of Latin America and Central Asia is very good and for many countries there almost annual surveys.

<h3>The poverty line and its history</h3>
The pioneering work to count the number of people in poverty by a common global standard was published by Montek Ahluwalia, Nicholas Carter, and Hollis Chenery in 1979[ref]Ahluwalia, Montek S., Nicholas G. Carter, and Hollis B. Chenery. 1979. ‚Äú<a href="http://planningcommission.nic.in/hindi/aboutus/speech/spemsa/msa027.pdf">Growth and Poverty in Developing Countries</a>.‚Äù Journal of Development Economics, 6(3): 299‚Äì341.[/ref]. The three authors based their estimates of global poverty figures on the Indian poverty line at the time. Until today the global poverty line is set by reference to the national poverty lines of poor countries. But instead of only considering India it is today an average of the poverty lines of a number of poor countries. This global poverty line was introduced in the World Development Report 1990 as the dollar-a-day poverty line. Since then it is based on the national poverty lines of a number of poor countries and was revised according to the national poverty lines and by taking into account price changes over time (inflation). The extreme poverty line was prominently used in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the first of which was to ‚Äúhalve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than $1 a day.‚Äù

In the current method the global poverty line is linked to the national poverty lines of poor countries. As it is called an absolute standard, this poverty line should not move upwards as poor countries grow richer or otherwise it becomes a relative poverty measure.

Another possibility to set a poverty line is to ask people about the level of income that is adequate in their society. This tradition of self-reports by poor people is based on the work of Bernard van Praag (1968)[ref]Van Praag, Bernard M. S. 1968. Individual Welfare Functions and Consumer Behavior. Amsterdam: North-Holland.[/ref]. The first figure in this entry ‚Äì from Angus Deaton ‚Äì shows the close relationship between the self-assessment of living conditions and the mean income in the society.¬†Stevenson and Wolfers (2008)[ref]Stevenson, Betsey, and Justin Wolfers. 2008. ‚Äú<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Spring%202008/2008a_bpea_stevenson.PDF">Economic Growth and Subjective Well-Being: Reassessing the Easterlin Paradox</a>.‚Äù Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2008: 1‚Äì87.[/ref] showed that this relationship not only holds between but also within countries ‚Äì more information can be found in the <a href="/happiness-and-life-satisfaction/">entry about happiness and subjective well-being</a>. National poverty lines are in fact often informed by the self-assessment of citizens of these countries.
<h3>Methodology used by the World Bank and quality issues</h3>
Ferreira et al (2015)[ref]Francisco H. G. Ferreira, Shaohua Chen, Andrew Dabalen, Yuri Dikhanov, Nada Hamadeh, Dean Jolliffe, Ambar Narayan, Espen Beer Prydz, Ana Revenga, Prem Sangraula, Umar Serajuddin, Nobuo Yoshida (2015) ‚Äì <a href="http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/10/14/090224b083144b10/2_0/Rendered/PDF/A0global0count00and0initial0results.pdf">A Global Count of the Extreme Poor in 2012: Data Issues, Methodology and Initial Results</a>. Poverty Global Practice Group &amp; Development Data and Research Groups. October 2015.[/ref] describe in detail the method used for estimating the global poverty figures published in Povcal Net. The poverty data is primarily based on household survey data. For the global poverty estimates published in October 2015, the World Bank used income and consumption distribution data ‚Äúfrom more than one thousand surveys covering 131 developing countries. The estimates are based on survey interviews of more than 2 million households, representative of 95 percent of the population in the developing world‚Äù.

These surveys are not carried out by the World Bank, but by the different National Statistical Offices and are therefore designed to be useful for the varying goals of these national offices. The challenge is therefore to harmonize this empirical data that was not designed to be internationally comparable:

Level of measurement: The first key issue for the World Bank is that the Povcal data is published in per capita terms, but the national surveys are mostly carried out on the household level.

Mix of consumption and income data: The second challenge for harmonizing the data is that the underlying household survey are a mix of income and consumption data. In poor countries, where <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/agricultural-employment/">many people are self-employed in agriculture</a>, consumption is typically much easier to measure in surveys than is income. The table shows that approximately 75 percent of the countries in the PovcalNet database have data on per capita consumption and only a quarter of the countries ‚Äì mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean ‚Äì report income per capita data. The fact that the Povcal data is based on these two very different welfare measures is a key weakness of the data and one that is according to Ferreira et al (2015) impossible to correct for; the authors write ‚Äúindeed, in part because there are few or no fixed, observable patterns in the relationship between income and consumption, no adjustments are made to income or consumption distributions in PovcalNet to make them more comparable.‚Äù Comparisons of income and consumption figures has shown that the inequality and poverty level of consumption estimates is lower than of that same economy's income inequality and income poverty.[ref]Christoph Lakner and Branko Milanovic (2013) ‚Äì <a href="http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-6719">Global Income Distribution: From the Fall of the Berlin Wall to the Great Recession</a>.[/ref]

Survey nonresponse: There is also theoretical and empirical evidence presented by Korinek et al. (2005)[ref]Korinek, Anton, Johan Mistiaen and Martin Ravallion. "<a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPOVRES/Resources/477227-1142020443961/2311843-1142870725726/2337154-1235766255498/Module1-13-NonResponse2009-EGalasso.pdf">Survey Nonresponse and the Distribution of Income</a>" Journal of Economic Inequality 4 (2006) no. 2: 33-55.[/ref] showing that as people become richer, they are less likely to respond to surveys. When richer individuals or households are less likely to answer surveys than poor people it has the consequence that survey-based estimates of consumption and income will understate the mean level of prosperity and overstate the share of people in poverty.

Survey design: Questionnaires are designed differently in different countries and these differences matter significantly for the level of measured poverty. For example the recall period for food consumption matters for the assessment of food consumption in a population ‚Äì research indicates that the reported food consumption is lower if the recall period is longer (for an example on India see Deaton and Kozel (2005)[ref]Deaton, A. and Kozel, V. 2005a. ‚Äú<a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPA/Resources/deaton_kozel_2004.pdf">Data and Dogma: The Great Indian Poverty Debate</a>‚Äù The World Bank Research Observer 20 (2): 177‚Äì99. doi:10.1093/wbro/lki009.[/ref] and for a study on how the questionnaire design matters see Beegle et al. (2012)[ref]Beegle, K., De Weerdt, J., Friedman, J., and Gibson, J. 2012. ‚Äú<a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/economics/news/seminars/otago07886511111.pdf">Methods of Household Consumption Measurement through Surveys: Experimental Results from Tanzania</a>‚Äù Journal of Development Economics 98 (1): 3‚Äì18. [/ref]). Jolliffe (2001)[ref]Jolliffe, D.

Volume 27 (Numbers 1-2): 1‚Äì23. [/ref] finds that questionnaires with more food items listed report higher food consumption when compared with a questionnaire with fewer items. However,¬† higher consumption totals, as reported in the surveys with a shorter recall period, are not necessarily more accurate as the Indian NSSO Expert Group on Sampling Errors (2003)[ref]NSSO Expert Group on Sampling Errors, ‚Äú<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4413129">Suitability of Different Reference Periods for Measuring Household Consumption: Results of a Pilot Study</a>‚Äù Economic and Political Weekly (January 25, 2003), 307‚Äì321.[/ref] found.

Not available microdata: For six of the 131 countries covered the World Bank relied (in October 2015) on grouped data. According to Ferreira et al (2015) this is because the World Bank was not authorized to share the microdata publicly and it could only rely on the grouped data that refers to quintile or decile shares.

Urban bias: The urban bias in pricing referring to the worry that in price comparisons more expensive goods in urban markets are measured and the often lower prices in rural areas are neglected.
<h4>Comparing poverty between countries and over time</h4>
The <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a> explains how adjustments are made for price changes over time (inflation) and between countries (PPP adjustments). For poverty measurements, the revision of PPPs have substantial consequences for the regional distribution but not for the trend over time as Deaton (2010)[ref]Angus Deaton (2010) ‚Äì <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/Deaton_Price_Indexes_Inequality_and_the_Measurement_of_World_Poverty_AER.pdf">Price Indexes, Inequality, and the Measurement of World Poverty</a>. American Economic Review, 100(1): 5-34. DOI: 10.1257/aer.100.1.5[/ref] explains:

<em>"The revision from 1985 to 1993 had relatively little effect on the global count but made sub-Saharan Africa appear to be much poorer, and Latin America appear to be much less poor. Indeed, it is the 1993 revision that ‚Äúestablished‚Äù sub-Saharan Africa as the region with the highest headcount ratio, a fact that has dominated subsequent discussions of world poverty; prior to revision, the measured prevalence of poverty in South Asia was substantially higher than in sub-Saharan Africa. At the time of that revision, I commented that ‚Äúchanges of this size risk swamping real changes, and it seems impossible to make statements about changes in world poverty when the ground underneath one‚Äôs feet is changing in this way,‚Äù Deaton (2001). The 2005 revision shifts the ground even more. The global count for 1993 jumps by almost half a billion people, the headcount ratio for East Asia doubles, there are substantial increases in Africa and South Asia, and a large reduction in Latin America. The Table shows these numbers for 1993, for which there are estimates using three sets of PPPs, [‚Ä¶]. Let me emphasize that the general trends [...] reappear whichever PPPs and poverty lines are used. The shifting of the ground refers only to the level of global poverty, and to its regional distribution."</em>
<h4>Poverty figures for regional aggregates and the timing of suveys</h4>
For individual countries the World Bank publishes poverty estimates only for years in which household survey data is available. For regional and global aggregates however it is necessary to estimate the poverty figures for all countries in a specific year. Ferreira et al (2015)[ref]Francisco H. G. Ferreira, Shaohua Chen, Andrew Dabalen, Yuri Dikhanov, Nada Hamadeh, Dean Jolliffe, Ambar Narayan, Espen Beer Prydz, Ana Revenga, Prem Sangraula, Umar Serajuddin, Nobuo Yoshida (2015) ‚Äì <a href="http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/10/14/090224b083144b10/2_0/Rendered/PDF/A0global0count00and0initial0results.pdf">A Global Count of the Extreme Poor in 2012: Data Issues, Methodology and Initial Results</a>. Poverty Global Practice Group &amp; Development Data and Research Groups. October 2015.[/ref] explain that in cases in which survey data before and after that specific year is available the World Bank reports an average weighted by the relative distance from these two surveys. To arrive at data for all countries in a specific year the consumption or income data from the latest survey is extrapolated by using growth rates from the national accounts. In this extrapolation the World Bank assumes distribution-neutral growth (no change in inequality since the last survey).

There are some countries for which no poverty estimates are available. Not including these countries in the regional or global aggregates would understate the level of global poverty. To avoid this the average poverty estimate of the world region in which this country is located is then assigned to that country for which no data is available.

High-income countries ‚Äì according to the definition of the World Bank ‚Äì are assumed to have no people living in extreme poverty in the global poverty figures published by the World Bank. Ferreira et al (2015) explain that ‚Äúalthough some people in rich countries report household per capita incomes that are below the international poverty line, per capita consumption is above this threshold for nearly everyone.‚Äù Chandy and Smith (2014) for example find that 1% to 4% of the US population have incomes of less than $2 a day, but when measured by consumption this share of Americans living with less than 2$ per day falls to less than 0.1%.

The timing of surveys can be problematic for several reasons: Most countries do not have regular annual surveys and to arrive at regional or global estimates for a particular year the World Bank uses data from the National Accounts to fill in the gaps. This makes it particularly problematic to link changes in poverty estimates to current events ‚Äì such as the financial crisis. It is preferable to study the change of poverty over longer time periods for which the data is based on household surveys. Additionally the timing of survey within a given year can matter for the measurement as for example the food provision varies throughout the year.
<h3>Survey based and National Accounts based poverty figures</h3>
The poverty figures published by the World Bank are based on household surveys as explained above. A second possibility to measure poverty is to start from the National Accounts. This is done by using National Accounts data (from the Penn World Tables) combined with inequality measures. First used was this technique by Ahluwalia et al. (1979)[ref]Ahluwalia, Montek S., Nicholas G. Carter, and Hollis B. Chenery. 1979. ‚Äú<a href="http://planningcommission.nic.in/hindi/aboutus/speech/spemsa/msa027.pdf">Growth and Poverty in Developing Countries</a>‚Äù Journal of Development Economics, 6(3): 299‚Äì341.[/ref]. More recent papers that followed this approach include Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) whose data is shown above.

In theory the household survey based and National Accounts based measures should match up, but in reality there are unfortunately often quite large discrepancies in growth rates between the survey data and the national accounts. Deaton (2005)[ref]Deaton, Angus (2005) ‚Äú<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/measuring%20poverty%20growing%20world%20deaton%20restats%202005.pdf">Measuring Poverty in a Growing World (or Measuring Growth in a Poor World)</a>‚Äù Review of Economics and Statistics, 87(1): 1‚Äì19.[/ref] reviews the reasons for these discrepancies.

How we measure extreme poverty also matters for the allocation of international aid.

Reviewing the many problems of poverty measurement Deaton (2010)[ref]Angus Deaton (2010) ‚Äì <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/Deaton_Price_Indexes_Inequality_and_the_Measurement_of_World_Poverty_AER.pdf">Price Indexes, Inequality, and the Measurement of World Poverty</a>. American Economic Review, 100(1): 5-34. DOI: 10.1257/aer.100.1.5[/ref] concludes that "probably the most urgent area for the poverty counts is not the [International Comparison Program], but the improvement in the consistency and timeliness of household surveys, and the upgrading of national accounts."

For all of these reasons we have to regard figures of extreme poverty country as rough estimates. This is a main reason why an essessment of living conditions around the world and over time should not be based on income and conumption measures alone but should take into account the many dimensions of well-being (health, education, nutrition etc.) that OurWorldInData.org captures.

Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy was around 30 years in all regions of the world. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to a very high inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health in those countries that remained poor. Over the last decades this global inequality decreased. Countries that not long ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly.¬†Since 1900 the global average life expectancy has more than doubled and is now approaching 70 years. No country in the world has a lower life expectancy than the the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Rising life expectancy around the world</h3>
The visualization below shows the dramatic increase in life expectancy over the last few centuries. For the UK ‚Äì the country for which we have the longest time-series ‚Äì we see that before the 19th century there was no trend for life expectancy: life expectancy fluctuated between 30 and 40 years.

Over the last 200 years people in all countries in the world achieved impressive progress in health that lead to increases in life expectancy. In the UK, life expectancy doubled and is now higher than 80 years. In Japan health started to improve later, but the country caught up quickly with the UK and surpassed it in the late 1960s. In South Korea health started to improve later still and the country achieved even faster progress than the UK and Japan; by now life expectancy in South Korea has surpassed life expectancy in the UK.

The chart also shows how low life expectancy was in some countries in the past: A century ago life expectancy in India and¬†South Korea was as low as 23 years. A century later, life expectancy in India has almost tripled and in South Korea it has almost quadrupled.

You can switch to the map view to compare life expectancy across countries. This view shows that there are still huge differences between countries: people in Sub-Saharan countries have a life expectancy of less than 50 years, while in Japan it exceeds 80.

<h3>It is not only about child mortality ‚Äì life expectancy by age</h3>
Yes, the decline of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> matters a lot for the increase of life expectancy. But as this chart shows there is much more to it.

Before the onset of modernity life was short. The gains in life expectancy since then were mostly due to changing mortality patterns at a young age: it was once common that every 3rd or even 2nd child died, but no longer. Our <a href="/child-mortality/">entry on child mortality</a> has more information.

But this chart here shows that the increase of life expectancy was not just due to the decrease in child mortality.¬†Child mortality is defined as the number of children dying before their 5th birthday. To see how life expectancy has improved without taking child mortality into account we therefore have to look at the prospects of a child who just survived their 5th birthday: in 1845 a 5-year old could expect to live 55 years. Today a 5-year old can expect to live 82 years. An increase of 27 years.

At higher ages mortality patterns have also changed. A 50-year old could once expect to live an additional twenty years. Today the life expectancy of a 50-year old has increased to 83.

And another important change can be studied in this chart: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/health/health-inequality/">health inequality</a> decreased hugely. Look by how much life expectancy differed by age in 1845 ‚Äì from 40 years for newborns to 79 for 70-year olds. Today this span is much smaller ‚Äì from 81 to 86. This is because the chance of dying at a younger age has been steadily decreasing, which means that the equality of life spans lived increased.

The data for life expectancy by age is taken from the Human Mortality Database. University of California, Berkeley (USA), and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany). Available at <a href="http://www.mortality.org">www.mortality.org</a> (data downloaded on 11 February 2014 ‚Äì being granted permission to use this data for the visualization on 13 February 2014).

The data on life expectancy at birth before 1845 is taken the data from Kertzer and Laslett (1995) - see below. Their sources are the 'British official statistics' and Wrigley and Schofield [1981] 1989.

(The Human Mortality Database data refers to remaining life expectancy for people in a 5 year age bracket (10-14, 15-19, ...). To calculate total life expectancy I have added the lower bound of each range to the remaining life expectancy for the given age group ‚Äì the values here should therefore be understood as the lower bound for total life expectancy.)[/ref]

For the entire world the following visualisation presents the estimates and UN-projections of the remaining expected life years for 10-year-olds. The rise ‚Äì best visible on the Map-view ‚Äì shows that the increasing life expectancy is not only due to declining child mortality, but that mortality at higher ages also declined globally.

<h3>Life expectancy has improved globally</h3>
Life expectancy in each region of the world stayed fairly stable for most of history until the onset of the ‚Äúhealth transition,‚Äù the period in which life expectancy began to increase. The chart below shows that the health transition began at different times in different regions; Oceania began to see increases in life expectancy around 1870, while Africa didn‚Äôt begin to see increases until around 1920.

The source of the historical estimates is Riley (2005):

<h3>Life expectancy increased in all countries of the world</h3>
There is a lot of information in the following ‚Äì rather unusual ‚Äì chart. On the x-axis you find the cumulative share of the world population. And all the countries of the world are ordered along the x-axis ascending by the life expectancy of the population. On the y-axis you see the life expectancy of each country.

For 1800 (red line) you see that the countries on the left ‚Äì India and also South Korea ‚Äì have a life expectancy around 25. On the very right you see that in 1800 no country had a life expectancy above 40 (Belgium had the highest life expectancy with just 40 years).

In 1950 the life expectancy of all countries was higher than in 1800 and the richer countries in Europe and North America had life expectancies over 60 years ‚Äì over the course of modernization and industrialization the health of the population improved dramatically. But half of the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì look at India and China ‚Äì made only little progress. Therefore the world in 1950 was highly unequal in living standards ‚Äì clearly devided between developed countries and developing countries.
This division is ending: Look at the change between 1950 and 2012! Now it is the former developing countries ‚Äì the countries that were worst off in 1950 ‚Äì that achieved the fastest progress. While some countries (mostly in Africa) are lacking behind. But many of the former developing countries have caught up and we achieved a dramatic reduction of global health inequality.

The world developed from equally poor health in 1800 to great inequality in 1950 and back to more equality today ‚Äì but equality on a much higher level.

<h3>The rise of maximum life expectancy</h3>
The following graph is taken from the paper '<a href="http://user.demogr.mpg.de/jwv/pdf/scienceMay2002.pdf">Broken Limits to Life Expectancy</a>' published in Science by¬†Oeppen and Vaupel in 2002.[ref]Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) - <a href="http://user.demogr.mpg.de/jwv/pdf/scienceMay2002.pdf">Broken Limits to Life Expectancy</a>. In Science, 296, 5570, 1029--1031.[/ref] It shows quite a lot of information:
<ul>
 	<li>The colored symbols represent the highest life expectancy of women from 1840 to today ‚Äì indicating that country with the highest life expectancy at each point in time. For instance, we can see that in the mid-1800s, Norway had the highest life expectancy, but then by 1880 people in non-Maori New Zealand were expected to live the longest lives. The data shows that in the¬† life expectancy in the leading country of the world has increased by three months every single year.</li>
 	<li>The solid horizontal line represents the results of the linear regression on all these points; remarkably, the maximum life expectancy seems to follow this linear trend very closely. The gray dashed line is the extension of this trend into the future, and the red dashed lines represent 'projections of female life expectancy in Japan published by the UN in 1986, 1999, and 2001.'</li>
 	<li>The author names listed on the right refer to multiple predictions of the maximum possible life expectancy for humans. The horizontal black lines extending from the publication denote the prediction in each publication of the asserted ceiling on life expectancy attainable by humans <em>and</em> the year in which the study was published. Dublin published a study in 1928 that asserted that the maximum life expectancy possible was less than 65 while at the same time life expectancy in New Zealand was already over 65. The predictions of maximum life expectancy were proven wrong again and again over the course of the last century. On average the predictions have been broken within 5 years after publication.</li>

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Better science and better health</h3>
David Cutler, Angus Deaton, and Adriana Lleras-Muney[ref]Cutler, David, Angus Deaton, and Adriana Lleras-Muney ‚Äì (2006) "The Determinants of Mortality." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 20(3): 97-120. Online here: <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.97">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.97</a> [/ref] write: <em>"Knowledge, science and technology are the keys to any coherent explanation. Mortality in England began to decline in the wake of the Enlightenment, directly through the application to health of new ideas about personal health and public administration, and indirectly through increased productivity that permitted (albeit with some terrible reversals) better levels of living, better nutrition, better housing and better sanitation. Ideas about the germ theory of disease were critical to changing both public health infrastructure and personal behavior. Similarly, knowledge about the health effects of smoking in the middle of the twentieth century has had profound effects on behavior and on health. Most recently, the major life-saving scientific innovations in medical procedures and new pharmaceuticals have had a major effect, particularly on reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease. There have also been important health innovations whose effect has been mainly in poor countries: for example, the development of freeze-dried serums that can be transported without refrigeration, and of oral rehydration therapy for preventing the death of children from diarrhea."</em>
<h3>Life expectancy and GDP</h3>
This graph displays the correlation between life expectancy and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In general, countries with higher GDP have a higher life expectancy. The relationship seems to follow a logarithmic trend: the unit increase in life expectancy per unit increase in GDP decreases as GDP per capita increases.

The cross-sectional relationship between life expectancy and per capita income is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_curve">Preston Curve</a>, named after Samuel H. Preston who first described it in 1975. In the chart I plot the cross-sectional relationship for the years 1800, 1950, 1980, and 2012. Interestingly we then find that the¬†life expectancy associated with a given level of real income is rising over time. If economic development were the only determinant of health countries that get richer would just move along the same curve. Since this is not the case we can conclude that economic development cannot be the sole determinant of health. A possible explanation for this changing relationship is that scientific understanding and technological progress makes some very efficient public health interventions ‚Äì such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/health/vaccination/">vaccinations</a>, hygiene measures, oral rehydration therapy, and public health measures ‚Äì cheaper and brings these more and more into the reach of populations with lower incomes.

Child mortality in rich countries today is much lower than 1%. This is a very recent development and was only reached after a hundredfold decline in child mortality in these countries. In early-modern times, child mortality was very high; in 18th century Sweden every third child died, and in 19th century Germany every second child died. With declining poverty and increasing knowledge and service in the health sector, child mortality around the world is declining very rapidly: Global child mortality fell from 18.2% in 1960 to 4.3% in 2015; while 4.3% is still too high, this is a substantial achievement. One reason why we do not hear about how global living conditions are improving in the media is that these are the slow processes that never make the headlines ‚Äì on no day in the last 5 decades was there ever the headline ‚ÄòGlobal Child Mortality Fell by 0.00719% Since Yesterday‚Äô.

Big countries like Brazil and China reduced their child mortality rates 10-fold over the last 4 decades. Other countries ‚Äì especially in Africa ‚Äì still have¬†high child mortality rates, but its not true that these countries are not making progress. In Sub-Saharan Africa, child mortality has been¬†continuously falling for the last 50 years (1 in 4 children died in the early 60s ‚Äì today it is less than 1 in 10). Over the last decade this improvement has been¬†happening faster than ever before. Rising prosperity, rising education and the spread of health care around the globe are the major drivers of this progress.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Country by country decline in child mortality</h3>
In the time series plot below I show child mortality over the long run. Today child mortality in industrialized countries is below 5 per 1,000 live births. The time series plot shows that these low mortality rates are a very recent development, and in pre-modern countries child mortality rates were between 300 and 500 per 1,000 live births. In the late 19th century, every second child¬†in Germany died before its fifth birthday. In developing countries the health of children is quickly improving ‚Äì but child mortality is still much higher than in developed countries.

A second interesting characteristic that is immediately noticeable is that the series are very 'spikey' in the 19th century and are then much smoother in the 20th century. This is partly because the data quality is improving over time but it also shows how frequent crises were in pre-modern times. The decline of crises is an important aspect of improving 'living standards'. In our <a href="//ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/volatility-of-food-prices/#year-to-year-variation-in-the-price-of-wheat-in-pisa-1351-1799-o-gradaref">entry on food price volatility</a> you find a long-run series in Pisa that shows how frequent food crises were. In the following plot you can see what these and other crises ‚Äì epidemics or wars, for example ‚Äì meant for the health of the population.

<h3>Global picture of child mortality from 1800 until today</h3>
The chart shows the child mortality rate ‚Äì the share of children dying before they reach the age of 5 ‚Äì for the entire world population at 4 different points in time.

<em><strong>How to read the following graph:</strong> On the x-axis you find the cumulative share of the world population. The countries are ordered along the x-axis descending by the country‚Äôs child mortality rate. This makes it possible to see the child mortality rate for each country. Some countries are labelled, but not all. It is also possible to see which share of the world population had a child mortality rate lower than a given level. For the orange line ‚Äì referring to¬†data from 1950-60 ‚Äì we see that close to 70% of the world population have a child mortality rate of higher than 10% back then.
</em>

For 1800 (red line), you see that the countries on the very left ‚Äì Yemen, India, and others that are not labelled ‚Äì¬†had a child mortality rate higher than 50%. Every second child died before the age of 5. On the very right of the red line you see that in 1800 the best-off countries in the world had a child mortality rate higher than 30%: Every third child died in the countries with the <em>best</em> health.

Looking at the orange line, you see that in the following 150 years some countries substantially reduced their child mortality rate: 30% of the world population has a child mortality under 10%. Other countries were stuck in poor health: More than half of the world (57%) had child mortality that were still higher than 20%. The world was clearly divided into developed and developing countries. The rapid progress of the industrialized countries had the consequence that the distribution of global health was hugely unequal.

The latest data refers to 2013. Global health has improved hugely. Particularly those countries that had the worst health in the 1950s experienced the most dramatic improvements. China for example reduced its child mortality from 28.4% to now 1.3%. The consequence of the faster progress in former developing countries is that global health inequality has fallen since the 1950s.

The global average child mortality rate (weighted population) was 43.3% in 1800 and now fell to 3.4%. Focusing at global inequality we see that in 1800 health was bad around the world, in the 1950s the world became unequal, and today we are back to higher equality but on a much higher level.

Comparing the position of countries on the red, orange, green and blue lines also makes it possible to see the change in a single countries: In 1800 every second child in South Korea died, in the 1950s the rate was halved (26%), and today it is down to 2.7%.

<h3>Child mortality globally post-1950</h3>
Though there are still large disparities between child mortality rates between different regions around the world, it is¬†steadily decreasing in all world regions.

<h3>World map of child mortality</h3>
The world visualizes the level of child mortality country by country. By moving the slider to a later year one can study the global decrease in child mortality. In fact child mortality has decreased in every single country over the last decades.

<h3>Child mortality by cause of death</h3>
In a publication in The Lancet Liu et al. (2015)[ref]Li Liu, PhD, Shefali Oza, MSc, Daniel Hogan, PhD, Jamie Perin, PhD, Prof Igor Rudan, MD, Prof Joy E Lawn, MD, Prof Simon Cousens, MA, Colin Mathers, PhD, Prof Robert E Black (2015) ‚Äì <a href="http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/diseases/tetanus/Lancet-2013-Global-child-mortality.pdf">Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality in 2000‚Äì13, with projections to inform post-2015 priorities: an updated systematic analysis</a>. The Lancet, Volume 385, No. 9966, p430‚Äì440, 31 January 2015.
[/ref] presented estimates on the causes of deaths of children in 2000 and 2013. The tree map below presents this data. Each rectangle corresponds to a cause of child mortality. The size of each rectangle shows the share of children killed by each cause. The three leading causes are preterm birth complications (15% of total; 0.965 million), pneumonia (2% in the first month, 13% later; 0.935 million in total), and intrapartum-related complications (11%, 0¬∑662 million).

44% of all children died in the first month of their life. More than half of all children (51.8%) died of infectious diseases. The researchers report "deaths due to infectious diseases, such as
pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria, are concentrated in the first 2 years of life, which should direct programmes towards these very young ill children".

The color of each rectangle indicates the annual reduction of the mortality rate from that specific cause since 2000. Child mortality from all causes declined; the smallest decline (0.2%) was achieved for pertussis, also known as whooping cough; the largest decline was achieved for measles (12.8%) for which <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/health/vaccination/">a vaccination is widely available</a>. As the causes of mortality later in childhood are declining faster the researchers observe a shift in the timing of child deaths closer and closer to the time of birth.

The absolute number of children dying decreased: In 2000 9,887 million children died before they were 5 years old ‚Äì 13 years later, 6,282 million children died. This happened while the absolute number of livebirths increased from 127,703 million in 2000 to 137,688 million in 2013.

Since cause of death data is not available for all countries in the world the researchers had to make use of three different sources of data: The preferred data was of course vital registration data; where not available Liu et al. (2015) estimated the cause of death with a multicause model, applying a multinomial logistic regression framework and when this was not possible they used a "verbal autopsy databased multicause model".

<h3>How many children did a woman give birth to that died before their 5th birthday?</h3>
The brutal reality of child mortality becomes clearer when one remembers what it means for each woman who loses her child.

The following visualization uses the data on <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">fertility</a> ‚Äì the number of children born per woman ‚Äì over time and combines it with information on child mortality over time. Taking these two time series together makes it possible to estimate how many children a woman on average lost before the children were five years old.
Below you see the data for Sweden which is one of the country for which we have the best historical data, the Swedish office for population statistics <em>Tabellverket</em> was founded as early as 1749.[ref]See the <a href="http://www.scb.se/en_/About-us/Main-Activity/Statistics-Swedens-History/">history of Statistics in Sweden</a>.[/ref] The visualization shows that throughout most of the 19th century Swedish women gave birth to more than 4 children. As we have seen above, child mortality in this period was often higher than 25%. Fertility and child mortality were so high that on average <em> every</em> woman lost 1 of her children before they could celebrate their 5th birthday. With the decline of child mortality and fertility this became very rare, in 2015 Swedish women lost on average 0.006 children before they were 5 years old.

In this visualization you can change the country for which this time-series is visualized to explore the trends in countries around the world. To <em>compare</em> the number of children lost per woman for several countries ‚Äì and see the data on a world map ‚Äì you can use <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-died-before-five-per-woman">this visualisation</a>.

The data shown in this visualization is calculated based on the historical estimates of fertility and child mortality presented at <a href="http://gapminder.org">Gapminder.org</a> (see the sources tab in the chart for more information); particularly for the early period data coverage is not as good as one wishes and it should be understood that the presented estimates are coming with a considerable uncertainty.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Child mortality and income level</h3>
As one would expect, income level of the country is extremely correlated with child mortality rate. The poorest countries have the highest levels of child mortality, and the countries with the highest income have the lowest rates. This relationship has remained the same even as child mortality has decreased around the world, as demonstrated below.

<iframe src="/grapher/child-mortality-by-income-level-of-country" width="100%" height="660px"></iframe>

The following scatter plot shows that child mortality is higher in countries in which a higher share of the population lives in extreme poverty.

<iframe src="/grapher/poverty-and-child-mortality" width="100%" height="660px"></iframe>
<h3>Better education of women reduces child mortality</h3>
There is a substantial literature on the effects of women's education on child mortality. A more educated female population is strongly associated with lower rates of child mortality as well as both human and economic development. Some of the¬†suggested reasons for this relationship are summarised in the figure below.
<h6>The linkages between female education, human development and economic development - Brown and Barrett[ref]Angela W. Browne &amp; Hazel R. Barrett (1991) Female Education in Sub‚ÄêSaharan Africa: the key to development?, Comparative Education, 27:3, 275-285, DOI: 10.1080/0305006910270303.[/ref]</h6>

<iframe src="/grapher/correlation-between-child-mortality-and-mean-years-of-schooling-for-those-aged-15-and-older" width="100%" height="660px"></iframe>

Gakidou et al. find that over half the decline seen in child mortality globally between 1970-2010 can be explained by improvements¬†in the education of women. What is more, they find that economic¬†growth (GDP) can only explain a very small amount of the reduction in child mortality.

Explanatory notes from the authors: "The lines represent the actual child mortality rate (blue); estimated child mortality rate if GDP for each country had remained at the level it was in 1970 or 1990 (green); estimated child mortality rate if education of reproductive-age women for each country had remained at the level it was in 1970 or 1990 (red); and estimated child mortality rate if both GDP and education of reproductive-age women had remained at their 1970 or 1990 levels (purple)."
<h6>Counterfactual analysis of effect of education and gross domestic product (GDP) on child mortality globally with 1970 (A) and 1990 (B) as base years - Gakidou et al.[ref]Emmanuela Gakidou, Krycia Cowling, Rafael Lozano, Christopher JL Murray (2010) ‚Äì <a href="http://can-mnch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/5.-EducationandChildSurvivalLancet.pdf">Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis</a>, The Lancet, Volume 376, Issue 9745, 18‚Äì24 September 2010, Pages 959-974, ISSN 0140-6736, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61257-3.[/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_nm-effect-of-edu-and-gdp-on-child-mortality.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-7094"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7094 size-large" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_nm-effect-of-edu-and-gdp-on-child-mortality-750x286.jpg" alt="nm-Effect-of-Edu-and-GDP-on-Child-Mortality" width="750" height="286" /></a>

Below we can see that a higher educational attainment by mothers is associated with lower child mortality rates within countries. For instance, Niger has the highest national average of child mortality, but within the country, mothers with a secondary school education or higher experience child mortality rates that are lower than the national averages of the next 16 countries listed.

The effect of education on child mortality is huge. Especially in places with relatively little education, the prospects for extending education are promising. In 2008, 4.4 million children younger than 5 years died in sub-Sahran Africa. The UNESCO estimates that an extension of secondary education for all women would save 1.8 million children per year.[ref]The source is UNESCO (2011) EFA Global Monitoring Report - <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001907/190743e.pdf">The hidden crisis: Armed conflict and education</a>.[/ref]
<h3>Health care and child mortality</h3>
In a publication in the American Economic Journal the authors report that Thailand's 2001 healthcare reform led to significant reductions in child mortality, especially among the poor.[ref]Gruber, Jonathan, Nathaniel Hendren, and Robert M. Townsend (2014) ‚Äì "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998713/">The Great Equalizer: Health Care Access and Infant Mortality in Thailand</a>." American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 6(1): 91-107.[/ref] The following graph shows for a large cross-section of countries that high expenditure on health more generally comes along with lower levels of child mortality.

<iframe src="/grapher/per-capita-total-expenditure-on-health-vs-child-mortality" width="100%" height="660px"></iframe>
<h3>When more infants survive ‚Äì fertility goes down</h3>
On the y-axis we measure the number of annual live births per 1,000 people. On the x-axis we measure how many infants, who were born alive, survive their 1st year of life ‚Äì this is the <em>infant survival rate.</em>

The chart shows how these two aspects changed over the course of the 20th century: At the beginning of the century all 4 countries can be found in the upper left corner ‚Äì they are characterized by high fertility and an infant survival rate below 85%. If we follow the 4 lines we are taken to the bottom right corner and see that women have fewer children when the mortality rate of babies goes down.

The causal link between infant survival and fertility is established in both directions: Firstly, increasing infant survival reduces the parents‚Äô demand for children. And secondly, a decreasing fertility allows the parents to devote more attention and resources to their children.

This link between fertility and child mortality is an immensely important insight and tells us what drives the acceleration and slowdown of population growth: In the initial stage of the transition, when fertility rates are still high but health is already improving, the population starts to grow. But then, a bit later, we see that this transition works to decrease population growth since improving health of the children leads to lower fertility. It is an important part of the mechanism behind the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/#the-demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>.

A very cynical view is that a decrease in child mortality is bad for the world since it would contribute to the overpopulation of the planet. The chart above shows that this opinion is not just¬†contemptuous of human life but plainly wrong: When more infants survive fertility goes down and the temporary population growth comes to an end. If we want to ensure that the world‚Äôs population increase comes to an end soon we must work to increase child survival.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
Child mortality is the probability per 1,000 live births that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five under current age-specific mortality patterns. The uncertainty associated with the estimates of child mortality can be understood if one compares different data sources. The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation does this for each country of the world. <a href="http://www.childmortality.org/index.php?r=site/graph#ID=BRA_Brazil">Here</a> is the chart on the child mortality of Brazil as one example. On the same website the differences between various data sources can be studied for a large number of countries.

Every suicide is a tragedy. According to estimates from the World Health Organisation (WHO), over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year. This corresponds to an age-standardized suicide rate of around 11.5 per 100,000 people ‚Äì a figure equivalent to someone dying of suicide every 40 seconds. Yet suicides are preventable with timely, evidence-based interventions.

The mortality data from the WHO suggest that the prevalence and characteristics of suicidal behaviour vary widely between different communities, in different demographic groups and over time. One important source of heterogeneity, both globally and within countries, is gender: suicide rates are much higher for males, particularly in high-income countries.

Suicide is an extremely complex issue, and while it is not possible to pin down its causes, there are some risk factors that have been identified, mainly through correlations. Mental health, specifically depression, is widely recognized as the most important risk factor. Here we discuss evidence of this, and other important correlates that shed light on possible interventions to prevent suicide.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Historical perspective</h3>
Self-murder was considered a serious offence in almost all Western European countries from the Middles Ages until (at least) the French Revolution.[ref]Paperno, I. (1997). Suicide as a cultural institution in Dostoevsky's Russia. Cornell University Press.[/ref] In England, one of the last European countries to decriminalise suicide, self-murder was a crime up until 1961. In many countries, such a Singapore, it is still considered a crime today. Because of this, historical data on this topic is not easily available; indeed, as we discuss in the Data Quality section, the stigma surrounding suicide makes measurement difficult still today.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Recent suicide mortality data</h3>
The World Health Organisation (WHO) published in 2014 the report <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/">Preventing suicide: a global imperative</a>, with the aim of increasing awareness of the public health significance of suicide, as well as making suicide prevention a high priority on the global public health agenda. Using the estimates from the WHO, the following visualisation presents suicide rates in different countries across the world over time. While most countries do not exhibit clear trends, it is evident that there are marked cross-country differences in levels.

<iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/suicide-rates-by-country" width="100%" height="660" scrolling="no"></iframe>

The fact that cross-country figures do not show clear trends is indicative of the fact that the prevalence and characteristics of suicidal behaviour vary widely between different communities, in different demographic groups and over time. The following two visualization focus on gender differences. The first chart presents trends in suicide rates by gender for a number of countries ‚Äì it shows that the rates for males do not track those of females. The second visualization shows global differences in gender ratios (that is, the ratio of the suicide rate of males by the suicide rate of females) ‚Äì as it can be appreciated, in the majority of countries the ratio is larger than one (with male suicide rates being more than 3 times larger than rates for females in most high-income countries). You can switch to the chart view of this graph to explore country-specific trends in more detail.

<iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/male-and-female-suicide-rate" width="100%" height="720" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Gender differences are also markedly different by age. The following graph, produced by Bartolote and Fleischmann (2002)[ref]Jos√© Manoel Bertolote and Alexandra Fleischmann, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1489848/pdf/wpa010181.pdf">Suicide and psychiatric diagnosis: a worldwide perspective</a>. World Psychiatry 1:3, October 2002.[/ref] with WHO data, shows that gender gaps are not constant across ages ‚Äì they are largest for middle-aged individuals (45-54 years old) and the elderly (75+ years old).

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Attempted suicide</h3>
Reliable cross-country data about the number of attempted suicides each year is not available. In contrast to data on deaths by suicide, no country in the world reports to the WHO official statistics on attempted suicide. However, it is broadly understood that the number of suicide attempts is much higher than the number of actual suicide deaths each year. In fact, available studies from specific countries suggest that individuals who have made prior suicide attempts are at much higher risk of dying by suicide than individuals who have not made prior suicide attempts. According to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150810050632/http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/Suicide_DataSheet-a.pdf">figures published by the Centers for Disease Control</a>, in the US there are roughly 25 attempts for each completed suicide; and for young adults aged 15-24 the ratio is much higher: there are approximately 100-200 suicide attempts for each suicide death.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Means of death by suicide</h3>
Understanding the prevalence of different means of death by suicide is important from a public policy perspective, because restricting access to the means of suicide is a key component of suicide prevention efforts. Indeed, one of the first steps in coping with suicidal thoughts at the individual level is to restrict access to elements that can be used to hurt oneself (see <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-help-dealing-with-your-suicidal-thoughts-and-feelings.htm">helpguide.org</a> for a complete list of steps).

Unfortunately, given the extreme stigma attached to suicide in most countries ‚Äì and the fact that it is often considered inappropriate to enquire or publish details in cases of death by suicide because of the effect that this may have on others ‚Äì, there is little systematic evidence documenting the prevalence of different methods. According to the WHO, the best way for researchers and policymakers to assess the patterns of suicide methods is to rely on data published in the scientific literature. A systematic review of world data for 1990‚àí2007 estimated that around 30% (within a plausible range of 27‚àí 37%) of global suicides are due to pesticide self-poisoning, most of which occur in low and middle income countries.[ref]Gunnell D, Eddleston M, Phillips MR, Konradsen F. (2007) <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-7-357">The global distribution of fatal pesticide self-poisoning: systematic review</a>. BMC public health.[/ref] This makes it one of the most common methods of suicide globally.

Other academic research has documented community-specific epidemics, such as the case of use of barbecue charcoal to produce carbon monoxide as a means of suicide in China ‚Äì in this specific instance, the epidemic began in 1998 in Hong Kong, from where it rapidly spread to Taiwan, where it became the most common method of suicide within eight years.[ref]Chang SS, Chen YY, Yip PSF, Lee WJ, Hagihara A, Gunnell D. (2014) <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001622">Regional changes in charcoal-burning suicide rates in East/Southeast Asia from 1995 to 2011: a time trend analysis</a>. PLoS Medicine.[/ref]

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Suicide and the internet</h3>
The internet is a powerful resource for those seeking help when dealing with suicidal thoughts. Understanding how people seek for such help can be very informative about possible ways to prevent suicide. Specifically, aggregated data stored by search engines can be a powerful source of information to understand and prevent suicide. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/trends/">Google Trends</a>, for instance, allows anyone to explore the popularity of specific search terms that may be linked to specific suicidal behavior ‚Äì almost in real time.

The following visualization presents three scatter plots documenting the relationship between the popularity of the search terms "suicide help", "how to suicide" and "how to overdose". These charts plot Google Trends data on the worldwide popularity of the above-mentioned search terms, where popularity is measured by Google as the ratio between the number of searches for a term in any given week, and the number of all searches in that week (see the <a href="https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4355164?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4365530">documentation</a> from Google for further details). Each point in these scatter plots corresponds to a different week in the period January 2004 - June 2016. As it can be seen, there are striking positive correlations suggesting that (i) search for help tends to go together with search for information on means to suicide; and (ii) search for information on means to suicide tends to go together with queries on drug abuse. Clearly, the individuals using Google are not representative of the world population as a whole ‚Äì certainly not if we restrict our analysis to queries in the English language.

But these results are indicative of the potential informativeness of data generated by search engines and emphasize how important it is to make help available via the web.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Correlates</h2>
Suicide is an extremely complex issue, and while it is not possible to pin down its causes, there are some risk factors that have been identified in the academic literature, mainly through correlations. As always, correlation does not imply causation; but correlation is a valuable starting point to detect risk factors and inform suitable policy interventions.

Depression and other mood disorders are widely recognized as the most important risk factors for suicide. In this entry we discuss evidence of this, and other factors that correlate with suicide.

As mentioned before, the objective of this data entry is to contribute to an informed open debate about ways to prevent suicide. <strong>If you are dealing with suicidal thoughts you can receive immediate help by visiting resources such as <a href="http://www.suicide.org/">Suicide.org</a>, or by calling 1-800-SUICIDE in the US.</strong>

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Mental health</h3>
Depression and other mood disorders are widely recognized among the most important risk factors for suicide. Bertolote and Fleischmann (2002), for instance, provide a systematic review of studies reporting diagnoses of mental disorders for individuals dying from suicide, and discuss the implications of psychiatric diagnosis for suicide prevention.[ref]The review in Bertolote and Fleischmann (2002) included "31 papers, published between 1959 and 2001 world wide. In total, 15,629 cases of suicide in the general population (above the age of 10 years, both sexes) were identified. Papers focusing only on specific age groups, such as young people or the elderly, or only on specific disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia, were excluded; usually these studies included a rather small sample size. All studies retained refer to people with or without history of admission to mental hospitals (47.5% versus 52.5%, respectively)."[/ref] They report that 98% of those who died by suicide had a diagnosable mental disorder. The following visualization, taken from their paper, provides details regarding the types of mental disorders in question. The two pie-charts correspond to different population sub-groups: the left chart corresponds to individuals who died by suicide and had been admitted to mental hospitals (labelled as 'psychiatric inpatient population'), and the right chart corresponds to individuals who died by suicide but had not been admitted to mental hospitals (labelled as 'general population'). Two points are worth emphasizing: (i) mood disorders ‚Äì mainly depression ‚Äì account for the largest share of diagnosed disorders in suicide cases, notably for those individuals who were diagnosed without being admitted to a mental hospital; and (ii) suicide is found associated with a variety of mental disorders. As noted by Bertolote and Fleischmann (2002), each one of the listed mental disorders entails a different therapeutic approach, and hence ‚Äòblanket approaches‚Äô are probably unsound.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Economic recessions</h3>
Various studies have analyzed the correlation between economic recessions and suicide rates. Chang et al. (2009)[ref]Chang S-S, Gunnell D, Sterne JAC, Lu T-H, Cheng ATA. Was the economic crisis¬†1997-1998 responsible for rising suicide rates in East/Southeast Asia? A time-trend analysis for Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Soc Sci Med 68 (2009).[/ref] used WHO and Taiwanese mortality statistics to explore whether there was a correlation between the Asian economic crisis of 1997-1998 and suicide rates. The following graphs summarize their results. As it can be seen, male rates in 1998 rose notably in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea, while rises in female rates were less marked in the same countries. Similar patterns in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on the economy.

Other studies, such as Reeves, McKee and Stuckler (2014)[ref]Aaron Reeves, Martin McKee, David Stuckler. <a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/early/2014/05/23/bjp.bp.114.144766.full.pdf">Economic suicides in the Great Recession in Europe and North America</a>.¬†The British Journal of Psychiatry, Jun 2014.[/ref], Chang et al.

Most of the studies exploring the effect of the economy on suicide tend to focus on patterns for specific events in particular countries or regions. However, more comprehensive studies using cross-country data over several different world regions and over longer time windows find similar results. Recently, Nordt et al. (2015)[ref]Nordt, C., Warnke, I., Seifritz, E., &amp; Kawohl, W. (2015). <a href="http://www.medreha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Modelling-suicide.pdf">Modelling suicide and unemployment: a longitudinal analysis covering 63 countries</a>, 2000‚Äì11. The Lancet Psychiatry, 2(3), 239-245.[/ref] retrospectively analysed public data for suicide, population, and economy over the period 2000-2011 across 63 countries in four world regions. Their results correspond with previous research indicating that a rise in unemployment is linked to an increase in suicides; however, they find that the relationship is non-linear ‚Äì the correlation between unemployment and suicide is stronger in countries with a lower rather than with a higher pre-crisis unemployment rate.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Gun prevalence</h3>
Data from the US indicate that firearms account for 46% of all suicides; in other high-income countries where the prevalence of firearms in the household is lower, firearms account for only 4.5% of all suicides.[ref]The US has the highest rate of suicide by firearm of any developed country; there were 12 suicides by all methods per 100,000 people in 2009, and the majority of those were firearm related. Suicide attempts by gun are also incredibly lethal; 85% of suicide attempts by gun were lethal in 2001 compared to 69% for the next most lethal method of suffocation/inhalation.[/ref]

Briggs and Tabarrok (2014)[ref]Justin Thomas Briggs and Alexander Tabarrok, <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/BriggsTabarrokFirearmsSuicide.pdf">Firearms and suicides in US states</a>. International Review of Law and Economics 37 (2014) 180-188.[/ref] investigate the relationship between firearm prevalence and suicide in a sample of all US states over the years 2000‚Äì2009. Below is a scatter plot providing evidence of the strong positive correlation that they find. The vertical axis shows the rate of suicide by firearms, and the horizontal axis shows the¬†percent of households that have firearms (according to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey conducted by the Center for Disease Control). The authors report that (i) firearms are very strongly related to firearm suicides; (ii) firearms are also strongly related to overall suicides ‚Äì despite evidence for substantial substitution in method of suicide‚Äì; and (iii) there is evidence for a diminishing effect of guns on suicides as ownership levels increase.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Daylight patterns</h3>
Seasonal variation in suicides has been shown in many countries, with most studies showing spring and summer peaks, contrary to the common belief that suicides peak when nights are longest (see Bj√∂rkst√©n et al. (2009) [ref] Karin S Bj√∂rkst√©n, Daniel F Kripke and Peter Bjerregaard. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685778/pdf/1471-244X-9-20.pdf">Accentuation of suicides but not homicides with rising latitudes of Greenland in the sunny months</a>. <i>BMC Psychiatry</i>, 2009; 9 (1): 20.[/ref] and the references therein). Bj√∂rkst√©n et al. (2009) document the accentuation of suicides ‚Äì but not homicides ‚Äì with rising latitudes of Greenland in the sunny months. They find that suicides were more concentrated in the summer months north of the Arctic Circle than south of it, and most concentrated in North Greenland where 48% of suicides occurred during the period of constant light. The following visualization provides evidence supporting these results. It shows the monthly distribution of suicides in different areas of Greenland ‚Äì the y-axis shows the number of suicide cases and the x-axis shows the corresponding month of the year, from January to December.

<h3>Divorce laws</h3>
Unilateral divorce is the process in which one can seek the dissolution of one's marriage without the consent of a spouse. Legal unilateral divorce laws make seeking divorce easier, and is seen as being especially important for people to be able to escape abusive marriages. Stevenson and Wolfers (2006)[ref]Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, <a href="http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/Divorceweb.PDF">Bargaining in the Shadow of the Law: Divorce Laws and Family Distress</a>. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, February 2006.[/ref] exploit the variation occurring from the different timing of divorce law reforms across the United States to evaluate how unilateral divorce changed family violence and whether the option provided by unilateral divorce reduced suicide and spousal homicide. The authors estimate a regression of suicide rates using the time since (until) the introduction of unilateral divorce as an explanatory variable (conditional on a series of other control variables). The following graphs summarize their results ‚Äì further technical details are provided in their paper. Each panel shows the effect of unilateral divorce on suicide rates for a specific age group (with the last panel showing the aggregate effect). Specifically, it can be seen from the second row of this figure that prime-age women account for the bulk of the main effect, with unilateral divorce substantially reducing the suicide rates of women in each of the age groups from 25‚Äì65.

<h3>Media coverage of suicide</h3>
A number of empirical studies have found that there is an increase in suicides following media reports of suicide ‚Äì a relationship referred to as 'copycat' behaviour. Gould et al.

American Behavioral Scientist 46, no. 9 (2003): 1269-1284. [/ref] provide a number of references from the literature on suicide clusters supporting the contention that suicide is "contagious". Indeed, based on such findings, the WHO has developed <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/resource_media.pdf">guidelines</a> for the reporting of suicides in the media.

In a review of the literature studying the link between media coverage and suicides, Stack (2003)[ref]Stack, S. (2003). <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/57/4/238.full">Media coverage as a risk factor in suicide</a>. Journal of epidemiology and community health, 57(4), 238-240.[/ref] analyzes a total of 293 findings from 42 academic studies, concluding that specific media content makes a substantial difference: studies measuring the effect of either an entertainment or political celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not; and studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect.

More recent studies corroborate this result. Using data from Austria, Niederkrotenthaler (2010)[ref]Niederkrotenthaler, T., Voracek, M., Herberth, A., Till, B., Strauss, M., Etzersdorfer, E., ... &amp; Sonneck, G. (2010). <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Role+of+media+reports+in+completed+and+prevented+suicide%3A+Werther+v.+Papageno+effects&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5">Role of media reports in completed and prevented suicide: Werther v. Papageno effects</a>. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 197(3), 234-243.[/ref] find that repetitive reporting of the same suicide and the reporting of suicide myths were positively associated with higher suicide rates; while coverage of positive coping in adverse circumstances ‚Äì as covered in media items about suicidal ideation ‚Äì was negatively associated with suicide rates.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Alcohol use</h3>
Alcohol abuse is strongly linked to death by suicide. In the US, in 2007 alcohol was involved in approximately a third of reported suicides.[ref]Center for Disease Control, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150701200635/http://www.cdc.gov:80/violenceprevention/pdf/nvdrs_data_brief-a.pdf">Suicides Due to Alcohol and/or Drug Overdose: a Data Brief from the National Violent Death Reporting System</a>, 2011.[/ref] Indeed, several academic studies have found a positive and significant association between per capita alcohol consumption and male suicide rates in a number countries (see Rossow (1996)[ref]Rossow, L. (1996). Alcohol and suicide‚Äîbeyond the link at the individual level. Addiction, 91(10), 1413-1416.[/ref]).

<h3>Summary - evidence-based interventions for suicide prevention</h3>
The following chart, taken from the report <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/">Preventing suicide: a global imperative</a>, summarizes the key risk factors for suicide ‚Äì as per the WHO's analysis of available evidence ‚Äì aligned with relevant interventions. Its message is clear: to prevent suicide, interventions need to take place from the universal to the individual level. One-size-fits-all approaches are likely to be ineffective.

<!-------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Measurement &amp; Data Quality</h2>
<h3>Measurement</h3>
Suicide rates are typically reported as number of deaths per 100,000 people; that is, the number of suicides in a country in a year, divided by the population and multiplied by 100,000.

In the data published by the WHO, suicide rates are 'age-adjusted'. This means that the figures are adjusted for the corresponding age structure of the relevant population. This is necessary because the numbers of deaths per 100,000 population are influenced by the age distribution ‚Äì two populations with the same age-specific mortality rates for a particular cause of death will have different overall death rates if the age distributions of their populations are different (for more information see the WHO's <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.aspx?iid=78">Indicator and Measurement Registry</a>).
<h3>Data quality</h3>
Data on suicides is deficient for two important reasons. Firstly, there is a problem with the frequency and reliability of vital registration data in many countries ‚Äì an issue undermining the quality of mortality estimates in general, not just suicide. The WHO reports that, of its 172 Member States for which suicide estimates are published, only 60 have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates. The estimated suicide rates in the other 112 Member States (which account for about 71% of global suicides) are based on modelling assumptions. The following visualization, from the WHO, shows the distribution of mortality data quality around the world. As might be expected, good quality vital registration systems are more likely available in high-income countries.
<h6>Quality of Suicide Mortality Data¬†‚Äì Map 2 in WHO (2014)[ref]World Health Organization, <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/131056/11/9789241564779_fin.pdf">Preventing suicide: a global imperative</a>, 2014. [/ref]</h6>
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7890" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-750x482.png" alt="WHO Suicide Data Quality" width="750" height="482" /></a>

Secondly, there are problems with the accuracy of the official figures made available to WHO by its Member States, since suicide registration is a complicated process involving several responsible authorities with medical and legal concerns. In spite of the fact that in the International Classification of Diseases the category name and code of suicide has remained relatively stable, it is widely accepted that suicide as a cause of death is hidden and underreported for different reasons, notably social and religious attitudes. Moreover, the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries contributes to under-reporting and misclassification. According to the WHO, suicides are most commonly found misclassified as ‚Äúdeaths of undetermined intent‚Äù and "accidents".

<h3>Decreasing Quantities of Oil Spilled</h3>
<p>ITOPF estimated that between 1970 and 2012 approximately 5.75 million tonnes of oil were lost as a result of tanker incidents. As single large incidents can be responsible for a huge share of all the oil spilt in a given year, it is advisable to look at trends or decade averages. Over these 43 years, the annual quantity of oil spilled decreased hugely. ITOPF notes that an 'amount greater than the total quantity of oil spilt in the decade 2000 to 2009 was spilt in several single years in earlier decades'. 2012 saw¬†the lowest oil spillage on record so far: 1000 tonnes were spilled. The development can be seen in the following two figures.</p>

<h3>Increasing Seaborne Oil Trade</h3>
<p>The change of seaborne oil trade can be inferred from the following figure. Since the mid-1980s, seaborne oil trade has been increasing while the number of oil spills is decreasing. This makes clear that the decrease in oil spills is not due to a decrease in oil trade. Information on the causes of spills can be found <a href=" http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/statistics">here</a>¬†(under 'Causes of Spills').</p>

<h3>Oil Spills Unrelated to Tankers</h3>
<p>According to the ITOPF dataset, the largest oil spill caused by a tanker was caused by the SS Atlantic Empresswhich sank close to Trinidad and Tobago in 1979. Wikipedia lists five oil spills which were not caused by tankers and were larger than this. The biggest oil spill in history was the Lakeview Gusher (1910-11 in California), the second was the Gulf War oil spill (1991), the 3rd biggest was the Deepwater Horizon (2010), 4th was Ixtoc I oil spill in Mexico (1979-1980) and 5th was a long-lasting spill in the Niger Delta between 1976 and 1996. (The source is Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_spills#Complete">here</a>)</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
<p>The<em> International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF)</em> maintains a database on oil spills caused by tankers, combined carriers and barges since 1970. The data covers¬†the entire planet. The database can be found <a href="http://www.itopf.com/information-services/data-and-statistics/statistics/">here</a>. As of 2013 10,000 incidents are recorded. For all of these the ITOPF data base records the type of oil spilled, the spill amount, the cause and location of the incident and the vessel involved. The size of a spillage is grouped into three categories: less than 7 tonnes, 7-700 tonnes, and more than 700 tonnes of oil spilled. The majority of incidents belong to the smallest category of spillages. Nowadays oil spills can be detected by computer systems on the basis of satellite images.¬†For the past, data is taken from other sources: Data on smaller spills are taken from the vessel owners and their insurers. For the larger spills the majority of information is taken from published sources of the shipping press.</p>

The impact that scientific developments had on healthcare expenditure is epitomized in the U.S. experience: in recent decades, as treatment possibilities expanded rapidly, expenditure on healthcare increased (private and public, both per capita and as a share of gross domestic product); and this occurred without major changes in insurance coverage. This had two important consequences: (i) the U.S. currently spends more government money per person on healthcare than many countries that fund universal programs, and (ii) spending is so concentrated that the top 1% of spenders account for more than 20% of total healthcare expenditure.[ref]Estimates from OECD - <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA">Health Expenditure and Financing Dataset</a>; and Schoenman, Julie A. "The concentration of health care spending." NIHCM Foundation Data Brief, National Institute of Health Care Management, Washington, DC (2012).[/ref]

Global expenditure on healthcare as a share of world income has been increasing, steadily but slowly over the course of the last couple of decades. In the background, however, there has been substantial cross-country heterogeneity, both in levels and trends. Regionally, high-income countries spend ‚Äì and have been spending ‚Äì a much larger share of their income on healthcare than low-income countries (about twice as much). Moreover, in contrast to high-income countries, in low and middle-income countries the public share of healthcare funding is much lower ‚Äì although it has been catching up ‚Äì and the role of out-of-pocket expenditures is much higher (above 50% of total expenditure in many countries).[ref]Estimates from WHO ‚Äì <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database">Global Health Expenditure Database</a> from the World Health Organization[/ref]

Healthcare financing in developing countries in the 21st century has been largely shaped by the flow of resources channeled through development assistance. These flows ‚Äì which saw a steep increase after the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals ‚Äì account for around 0.7% of the resources spent by high-income countries on healthcare. Although this may seem small in proportion to the national commitments of rich countries, for low-income countries at the receiving end of the transfers, these resources are substantial; in Sub-Saharan Africa they finance more than 25% of total expenditure on healthcare.[ref]Estimates from Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Financing Global Health 2014: Shifts in Funding as the MDG Era Closes. Seattle, WA: IHME, 2015.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<!---------------------Long Run--------------------->
<h3>Long-term perspective</h3>
<h4>When did the provision of healthcare first become a public policy priority?</h4>
Nowadays healthcare is commonly considered a ‚Äòmerit good‚Äô ‚Äì a commodity which is judged that an individual or society should have on the basis of need rather than ability and willingness to pay. This view, mainly grounded on the recognised positive externalities of healthcare consumption, is perhaps most visibly materialized in the fact that access to healthcare is currently a constitutional right in many countries.[ref]That healthcare should be considered a human right is nevertheless still subject of much debate. For an academic discussion of the principle of health care as a human right, see Smith, Richard, et al. "<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114728/">Shared ethical principles for everybody in health care: a working draft from the Tavistock Group</a>." British Medical Journal 318.7178 (1999): 248.[/ref] However, a couple of centuries ago the situation was very different. In fact, during the Middle Ages health was considered a matter of destiny across most of Western Europe; it was only afterwards, under the influence of Mercantilism and the Enlightenment, that this view started changing and public authorities increased their ambitions concerning the promotion of public health.[ref]For instance, concrete cases of successful interventions aimed at curbing the spread of the plague are recorded in Marseille and Provence 1720‚Äì1722.[/ref] Sundin and Willner (2007) say that ‚Äú[g]enerally, before the era of the Enlightenment, it was thought that health was God‚Äôs gift and disease and death was His punishment for the sins of an individual, the congregation, the whole nation or its rulers. Hence, to live a decent life in accordance with His will and repenting one‚Äôs sins were considered the most effective preventive measures against illnesses".[ref]Sundin, Jan, and Sam Willner. (2007) <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:17729/FULLTEXT01.pdf">Social change and health in Sweden: 250 years of politics and practice.</a> Swedish National Institute of Public Health.[/ref]

To our knowledge, the earliest data on financing of healthcare dates back to the late 19th century ‚Äì this is when many European countries began officially establishing healthcare systems through legislative acts. The following visualization presents public expenditure on healthcare as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP henceforth) for a selection of high-income countries for the period 1880-1994 using data from Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000)[ref]Tanzi, Vito, and Ludger Schuknecht. <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kHl6xCgd3aAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Public+spending+in+the+20th+century:+A+global+perspective&amp;ots=WhdEEdxaWN&amp;sig=XJsyIdSA8C2cD-wqOFVrBCtuaY4#v=onepage&amp;q=Public%20spending%20in%20the%2020th%20century%3A%20A%20global%20perspective&amp;f=false">Public spending in the 20th century: A global perspective</a>. Cambridge University Press, 2000 [/ref] and Lindert (1994)[ref]Lindert, Peter H. "The rise of social spending, 1880-1930." Explorations in Economic History 31, no. 1 (1994): 1-37.[/ref]. We've included eight countries for reference, but you can add other countries to the same chart by clicking on the corresponding option. As it can be appreciated, public expenditure on healthcare in all of these countries followed roughly similar paths; and this is despite early differences in their healthcare regimes (for a detailed account of the institutional evolution of healthcare regimes in these countries see the <a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Social-Policy/Health/Organisational-Structure/DR4-04-ev-HC-ref.html">report prepared by CESifo DICE</a>).

<h4>In European countries healthcare expenditure only began rising several years after the expansion of insurance coverage</h4>
The steeper increase in public expenditure on healthcare observed in European countries after the Second World War is largely due to the fact that medicine had major breakthroughs during the second half of the 20th century ‚Äì beginning, notably, with the discovery and use of penicillin and other antibiotics. Before these scientific developments took place, the main component of healthcare was not treatment but income insurance, an insurance paying benefits to those who were unable to work due to poor health. In fact public health insurance for workers was already substantial in a number of European countries before the Second World War. The following visualization presents public health insurance coverage as percent of labour force for a number of European countries (missing observations in this graph reflect lack of public insurance programs for the corresponding year/country). Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000) ‚Äì the source for the data in this figure ‚Äì note that by 1929 all the eleven European countries shown in this visualization had at least voluntary insurance schemes; and that by 1935 half their labor force was covered by health insurance.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-health-insurance-coverage2" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>In the 20th century healthcare expenditure grew rapidly with the discovery of powerful new treatments</h4>
Having introduced universal access to healthcare in 1948 through the National Health Service, the United Kingdom is a particularly interesting instance to study in detail.[ref]The National Health Service (NHS) was established in 1948 with the aim of providing health services to all UK citizens, financed by general taxation and free at the point of use.[/ref] The following visualization shows that the costs of this universal-access system grew more in the first decade of the 21st century, than they did in the first two decades immediately after its inception.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/203" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>In the last century US public healthcare expenditure grew faster than private expenditure</h4>
The U.S. is an interesting case to study historical changes in healthcare expenditure. In contrast to the UK, discussed above, the US does not have a universal public health insurance, and its healthcare system has been historically financed through a large share of private funds. The following visualisation presents public and private spending in healthcare in the U.S. as a percent of GDP (clicking on the 'expanded' option switches from absolute expenditure as a percent of GDP, to shares of expenditure by source). It shows that both public and private expenditure went up substantially in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. And this increase was such that public resources became an increasingly important source to finance healthcare (despite the fact that public resources always accounted for less than half of total spending on healthcare). The continued increase in public expenditure on healthcare in the U.S. means that today it actually spends more government money per person on healthcare than many countries that fund universal programs. Specifically in comparison to the U.K., by 1995 the U.S. already spent more public resources (as a percent of GDP) than the British NHS.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/view/205" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>How did insurance coverage change in the US during the period of rapid growth in healthcare expenditure in the 20th century?</h4>
The lion's share of the above-mentioned historical increase in healthcare expenditure in the U.S. took place without an underlying increase in the share of people who were covered by health insurance. The following visualization supports this; it presents a plot of coverage rates by type of plan (particular care should be taken when reading this graph, since insurance plans are not mutually exclusive; this means that those covered by 'private' and 'government' plans add up to more than those covered by 'any plan'). As it can be seen, total health insurance coverage remained virtually constant at around 85% for decades, while private and public healthcare expenditure increased continuously over the same period. Interestingly, this data also shows an apparent change in coverage trends after 2012, when the ‚ÄòAffordable Care Act‚Äô started kicking in. The <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/188045/uninsured-rate-fourth-quarter-2015.aspx?utm_source=genericbutton&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=sharing">most recent Gallup estimates</a> (fourth quarter of 2015) place total coverage at 88.1%.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/health-insurance-coverage-in-the-us" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>What was the consequence of growing expenditure without insurance expansion in the US?</h4>
The fact that insurance coverage remained stable while healthcare spending was increasing rapidly due to major improvements in treatment possibilities during the 20th century, implied that healthcare expenditure in the U.S. grew highly concentrated. The following graph, produced by the National Institute for Health Care Management (NIHCM), shows the cumulative distribution of healthcare spending in the U.S., using data on personal expenditures during the year 2009, across the entire 'non-institutionalized civilian population'.

The source of the data for this visualization is the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ‚Äì a nationally representative longitudinal survey that collects information on healthcare utilization and expenditure, health insurance, and health status, as well sociodemographic and economic characteristics for civilian non-institutionalized population. According to the source, the data refers to 'non-institutionalized civilian population', in the sense that it excludes care provided to residents of institutions, such as long-term care facilities and penitentiaries, as well as care for military and other non-civilian members of the population. The data corresponds to 'personal healthcare services', in the sense that they exclude administrative costs, research, capital investments and many other public and private programs such as school health and worksite wellness.

This graph should be read similarly to a Lorenz curve: the fact that the cumulative distribution of spending bends sharply away from the 45% degree line is a measure of high inequality (this is the intuition of the Gini coefficient that we discuss in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">income inequality</a> data entry). As it can be seen, the top 5% of spenders account for almost half of spending, and the top 1% account for more than 20%. While some concentration in expenditure is to be expected when looking at the distribution across the entire population ‚Äì because it is in the nature of healthcare that some individuals, particularly those older and with complicated health conditions, will require large expenditure ‚Äì, these figures seem remarkably large. They suggest important inequality in access, over and above inequality in need. Indeed, the publisher of the graph notes that a report from the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission shows that personal spending for individuals covered by Medicaid is somewhat less concentrated than for the population as a whole.[ref]Medicare Payment Assessment Commission. (2011) A Data Book: Health Care Spending and the Medicare Program.

<h4> How quickly can insurance coverage expand?</h4>

We have already pointed out that European countries pioneered the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage in the first half of the twentieth century. The following visualization, from the <a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2014-human-development-report.html">Human Development Report (2014)</a>, places the achievements of these countries in perspective. Specifically, the following graph plots healthcare protection coverage for a selection of countries during the period 1920-2010. As we can see, France, Austria and Germany increased healthcare coverage in the years 1920-1960, while Spain, Portugal and Greece did it later, in the years 1960-1980. Interestingly, however, this graph also shows some notable examples of countries that expanded healthcare coverage much later, but much more quickly. In particular, China, Rwanda and Vietnam built health protection systems in the 21st century, almost from scratch, achieving near universal coverage in only a decade. These examples show that healthcare protection can be expanded very quickly, and not only at low baseline levels of coverage.

<h3>Recent trends in domestic healthcare expenditure around the world</h3>
<h4>Has aggregate global expenditure on healthcare increased in the last couple of decades?</h4>
In the last two decades total aggregate global expenditure on healthcare has been relatively stable, albeit with a slow steady increase. The following visualization uses data from the World Health Organisation (published in the World Development Indicators) to show this. Total healthcare spending as a percent of GDP has seen an overall increase of roughly 1.5 perceptual points over the last two decades, with a relatively constant share of resources coming from the public sector.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-health-expenditure-as-share-of-global-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Cross-country heterogeneity in total healthcare expenditure is very large</h4>
Global trends in healthcare expenditure mask a great deal of heterogeneity. The following map shows how total expenditure on healthcare has changed across the world. Clicking on the 'chart' tab in this visualization allows you to plot country-specific series. Although trends are not very pronounced for most countries, there are clear exceptions (e.g. Ecuador). And there are strong differences in levels: countries with higher GDP per capita exhibit substantially higher expenditure on healthcare as a share of their income. This salient feature is explored in more detail below under <em>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</em>.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-healthcare-expenditure-as-share-of-national-gdp-by-country?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Global growth in healthcare expenditure has been driven by low and middle-income countries</h4>
World-wide cross-country data shows that, while the public share of resources used to finance healthcare has been stable in the aggregate, there is substantial underlying heterogeneity. The first visualization below presents public spending on healthcare as a share of total healthcare spending by country (again, with our usual 'chart' and 'map' views) ‚Äì it shows large differences even among relatively homogeneous industrialized market economies. The second visualization presents the same variable (public spending on healthcare as a share of total healthcare) but aggregating countries by income levels (World Bank classification) ‚Äì this shows that there have been substantial underlying shifts across regions. More specifically, in countries in the low-income and upper-middle-income brackets, there has been a marked increase in the share of public resources used to finance healthcare; in high-income countries there is no clear trend.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-public-expenditure-on-healthcare-by-country?tab=map" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<h4>How large is domestic public expenditure in developing countries after removing funds from development assistance?</h4>
The following visualization ‚Äì produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) ‚Äì presents public health expenditure from autonomous sources in absolute terms (billions of 2011 U.S. dollars) for developing countries.[ref]For the list of countries considered as 'developing' in this visaluzation see the appendix A in <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/record-attached-files/IHME_DAH_DATABASE_1990_2015_USERS_GUIDE_0.zip">IHME DAH Database 1990-2015 - User Guide</a> [/ref] These numbers correspond to public healthcare expenditure after removing funds provided directly to the developing countries by development assistance partners. As we can see, healthcare spending from autonomous sources has increased substantially in these countries. Below we discuss development assistance for health in more detail.

<h3>Recent trends in international flows of global health financing</h3>
<h4>How large are international flows of global health financing?</h4>
The Millennium Development Goals have been associated with major increases in global health financing flows, particularly for the health focus areas explicitly targeted (fight against child mortality, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis). An important part of these financing flows occur under the label of development assistance. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) defines development assistance for health as all financial and in-kind contributions provided by global health channels to improve health in developing countries (including grants, as well as concessionary loans, provided with no interest or at a rate significantly lower than the going market rate).

The IHME reports that since the formation of the Millennium Development Goals, $227.9 billion in development assistance has targeted these health focus areas. These flows account for around 0.7% of the resources spent by high-income countries on healthcare. Although this may seem small in proportion to the national commitments of rich countries, for low-income countries at the receiving end of the transfers, these resources are substantial; in sub-Saharan Africa they finance more than 25% of total expenditure on healthcare[ref]In middle-income countries, also receiving some of such development assistance funds, the weight is much lower ‚Äì external funding accounts for less than 5% of spending in these countries.[/ref]

The report <em>Financing Global Health 2014</em>, produced by the IHME, provides a detailed account of this source of funding for healthcare, and how it has changed over the last two decades. The data can be accessed from IHME's website, where there are also some excellent interactive visualizations. The chart below shows the evolution of development assistance for health by source, over the last fifteen years. As it can be seen, these funds increased sharply in the period 2000-2010, but have plateaued since. Considering that this source of funding has a larger weight in those countries with the lowest income, the recent change in trend is particularly problematic for the poorest.

<h4>What are the main channels and recipients of development assistance for health?</h4>
The following visualization uses aggregate 2000-2012 figures to show the relationship between sources of development assistance funds, and the corresponding channels and recipient regions. The main features here are the weight of the U.S. as a source-channel, and the sub-Saharan Africa region as a recipient.

<h3>Recent trends in private funding for healthcare</h3>
<h4>How important are out-of-pocket expenditures around the world?</h4>
In many countries an important part of the private funding for healthcare takes the form of 'out-of-pocket' spending. This refers to direct outlays made by households, including gratuities and in-kind payments, to healthcare providers. The following visualization presents out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare by country (as percent of total healthcare expenditure). As it can be seen, in high-income countries these outlays tend to account for only a small fraction of expenditure on healthcare (e.g. France, where the share was always below 8% in the entire series 1995-2013); while in low-income countries, they account for the majority of funding (e.g. Afghanistan, where the share of out-of-pocket expenditure reached 87.7% in 2002). Many countries have followed a clear path in the direction of reducing this type of expenditures (particularly in the developing world), yet some countries have moved in the opposite direction (Russia is a notable case in point, with a threefold increase in the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in the last decade).

<h4>Can universal healthcare coverage be realistically achieved through private expenditure?</h4>
In countries where healthcare is principally financed through public funds, out-of-pocket spending is typically low; this is natural, since in these countries there is essentially universal coverage through public insurance (e.g. Cuba, UK, Sweden, France). And by the same logic, out-of-pocket spending is also low in countries where healthcare is largely financed through private funds in the form of private voluntary insurance (e.g. US). It is in countries with low public healthcare spending and low private voluntary insurance that out-of-pocket expenditure is high (e.g. India, Afghanistan, Sudan). This is shown in the following visualization from Jamison et al (2013);[ref] Jamison, Dean T., et al. "<a href="http://dcp-3.org/sites/default/files/resources/Global%20Health%202035%20Report.pdf">Global health 2035: a world converging within a generation</a>." The Lancet 382.9908 (2013): 1898-1955[/ref] it illustrates how much progress different countries have made in providing 'prepaid care' and the extent to which they use public funds (compulsory social insurance or funding from general government revenue) or private voluntary insurance. As it can be seen, there are no countries near the top-left corner while there are several in the bottom-right. The message seems to be that achieving universal coverage requires government or publicly mandated finance ‚Äì arguably a justification for some of the reforms recently implemented by the Affordable Care Act in the US (see discussion immediately below).

<h4>Is the Affordable Care Act in the US improving healthcare coverage?</h4>
In June 2012 the US introduced the Affordable Care Act (ACA) ‚Äì a legal reform aiming to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of healthcare. In other sections in this entry we provide evidence of some of the underlying issues that motivated a reform to improve healthcare coverage in the US.[ref]See <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjevoice/v_3a7_3ay_3a2010_3ai_3a5_3an_3a1.htm"> White, C. (2010). The health care reform legislation: an overview. The Economists' Voice, 7(5)</a> for a non-specialist overview of the ACA‚Äôs major provisions, their logic, and the federal budgetary implications. [/ref] Specifically, in the section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#how-did-insurance-coverage-change-in-the-us-during-the-period-of-rapid-growth-in-healthcare-expenditure-in-the-20th-century">long-term perspective</a> we show that the share of uninsured individuals in the US is large and has remained virtually constant during decades of substantial growth in expenditure; and in the discussion <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#can-universal-healthcare-coverage-be-realistically-achieved-through-private-expenditure">immediately above </a> we noted that achieving universal coverage is likely to require government or publicly mandated finance. Here we want to focus on whether insurance coverage indeed improved after the introduction of the ACA. The following visualization shows the percentage of individuals in the US without health insurance for the period 1963-2015. As we can see there are two marked changes in the trends separated by a long period of remarkable stability: there is a sharp drop in the number of uninsured in 1965 with the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, then relatively little change for decades, and then another sharp drop in 2012 with the introduction of the ACA. Disaggregated data shows that those states that decided to expand their Medicaid programs saw larger reductions in their uninsured rates from 2013 to 2015, especially when those states had large uninsured populations to start with (see <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2533698">Obama (2016)</a>.[ref] Obama, B. (2016). United States health care reform: progress to date and next steps. JAMA. [/ref] for further discussion of these figures). While strictly speaking this is only descriptive evidence ‚Äì we cannot know what would have happened to the trends without the introduction of the ACA ‚Äì, it seems reasonable to assume that the observed improvements in healthcare coverage are indeed a consequence of the ACA.

<!--------------Correlates-------------------------->
<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Prices and income</h3>
<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and national income?</h4>
At a cross-country level, the strongest predictor of healthcare spending is national income (you can find more about measures of national income in our <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">entry on GDP data</a>). The following visualization presents evidence of this relationship. The correlation is striking: countries with a higher per capita income are much more likely to spend a larger share of their income on healthcare. In a seminal paper, Newhouse (1977)[ref]Newhouse, J.P. (1977), ‚ÄúMedical care expenditure: a cross-national survey‚Äù, Journal of Human Resources 12:115‚Äì125.[/ref] showed that aggregate income explains almost all of the variance in the level of healthcare expenditure (specifically, Newhouse (1977) showed that among a group of 13 developed countries, GDP per capita explained 92 percent of the variance in per capita health expenditure). Other studies have confirmed that this strong positive relationship remains after accounting for additional factors, such as country-specific demographic characteristics.[ref]Interestingly, there are important institutional variables that are also significantly correlated with healthcare expenditure after controlling for income. For example, the use of primary care ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù seems to result in lower health expenditure. And lower levels of health expenditure also appear to occur in systems where the patient first pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement, compared to other systems. For more information see page 46 in Culyer, A. J., &amp; Newhouse, J. P. (Eds.). (2000). <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FQCgxj_Ho_YC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Handbook+of+health+economics&amp;ots=fgypbKmLSP&amp;sig=B_JwMhjjvveLkGYjK6Ne3Q9Oyv4#v=onepage&amp;q=Handbook%20of%20health%20economics&amp;f=false">Handbook of health economics</a>. Elsevier.[/ref] Although in strict sense this result cannot be interpreted causally ‚Äì¬†since countries differ in many unobservable aspects that relate both to income and healthcare spending ‚Äì, more sophisticated econometric models dealing with the issue of 'omitted variables' seem to confirm that the effect of per capita GDP on expenditure is clearly positive and significant (for a technical discussion of this conclusion see Culyer and Newhouse (2000)).[ref]Culyer, A. J., &amp; Newhouse, J. P. (Eds.). (2000). <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FQCgxj_Ho_YC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Handbook+of+health+economics&amp;ots=fgypbKmLSP&amp;sig=B_JwMhjjvveLkGYjK6Ne3Q9Oyv4#v=onepage&amp;q=Handbook%20of%20health%20economics&amp;f=false">Handbook of health economics</a>.

As we discussed in the previous section on international flows of global health financing, in some countries an important part of the income that is available to finance healthcare comes from international development assistance. Lu et al. (2010)[ref]Lu, C., Schneider, M. T., Gubbins, P., Leach-Kemon, K., Jamison, D., &amp; Murray, C. J. (2010). <a href="http://environmentportal.in/files/Public%20financing%20of%20health%20in%20developing%20countries.pdf">Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis</a>. The Lancet, 375(9723), 1375-1387.[/ref] use data from the IHME ‚Äì the same data we discussed in the previous section ‚Äì to show that there is a negative correlation between development assistance for health provided to governments, and government health funding from autonomous sources. Interestingly, this 'crowding-out' effect depends on the channel: the correlation between international health aid to non-governmental organizations and government health funding is negative.
<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and government tax revenue?</h4>
In the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/#how-large-is-domestic-public-expenditure-in-developing-countries-after-removing-funds-from-development-assistance">previous section</a> we pointed out that healthcare spending from autonomous sources has increased substantially in many low and middle-income countries over the last couple of decades. The following chart shows a recent snapshot of the cross-country correlation between tax revenue and healthcare spending in these countries. We can see that developing countries with higher tax revenues tend to spend more on healthcare. In fact, in a recent paper, Reeves et al. (2015)[ref] Reeves, A., Gourtsoyannis, Y., Basu, S., McCoy, D., McKee, M., &amp; Stuckler, D. (2015). Financing universal health coverage‚Äîeffects of alternative tax structures on public health systems: cross-national modelling in 89 low-income and middle-income countries. The Lancet, 386(9990), 274-280.[/ref] estimate the relationship between tax revenue and access to healthcare in developing countries, and find that tax revenue is an important statistical determinant of progress towards universal health coverage ‚Äì and this remains true after controlling for country-specific time-invariant factors (country ‚Äòfixed effects‚Äô). If we interpret these results causally ‚Äì which as usual requires making assumptions‚Äì, the implication seems to be that increasing domestic tax revenues contributes importantly to achieving universal health coverage, particularly in countries with low tax bases. Exploring the relationship between health outcomes and different types of taxation, Reeves et al. (2015) further suggest that pro-poor taxes on profits and capital gains may support expanding health coverage without the adverse associations with health outcomes observed for higher consumption taxes.[ref] One has to be cautious when interpreting these results causally. Bear in mind that the fixed-effect approach used by Reeves et al. (2015) does not solve problems associated with time varying unobservables, or potential simultaneity of variables in the model.[/ref]

<h4>How sensitive is healthcare spending to changes in prices?</h4>
Empirical evidence suggests that healthcare spending is not only sensitive to changes in income (as discussed above), but in many instances, also sensitive to changes in <em>prices</em>. As it turns out, price-sensitivity is so critical in low-income countries, that small costs for important healthcare products make a vast difference in demand.[ref] Whether healthcare spending is highly responsive to price changes in other contexts is still the subject of academic discussion. We reference here empirical evidence from developing countries, focusing on price changes in the form of user fees. Other studies focusing on other populations find different results. For an interesting (technical) discussion about estimates of price elasticity of healthcare in the U.S. see Kowalski, Amanda.

<h4>Prices for healthcare services are affected by productivity changes in other markets</h4>
In most countries with market economies, the market for healthcare is only one of many markets competing for the same resources; because of this the prices for healthcare services are affected by productivity changes in other markets. Economic theory suggests that, if the productivity of the healthcare industry increases slower than that of other industries (a probable scenario given that healthcare provision is particularly labour-intensive), then prices in the healthcare sector are likely to grow faster than inflation, and expenditure as a share of income is thus likely to grow (this argument is known as <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21563714">Baumol‚Äôs ‚Äòcost disease‚Äô</a>). The following graph from Culyer and Newhouse (2000) shows that in the U.S., over the course of the 20th century the growth in the consumer price index for all goods and services (CPI) was lower than the growth in the medical consumer price index (MCPI). You can read more about the composition of the bundle of goods and services measured in the CPI and their relationship to GDP deflators in our <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/#differences-between-cpi-and-gdp-deflator">entry on GDP data</a>.

<h3>Health returns to healthcare investment</h3>
<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy?</h4>
Healthcare is one of the most important inputs to produce health; and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> is one of the key measures of a population's health. The following visualization shows the relationship between life expectancy at birth and healthcare expenditure per capita. This chart shows the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available (1995 and 2014 respectively). The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. As it can be seen, countries with higher expenditure on healthcare per person tend to have a higher life expectancy.And looking at the change over time, we see that as countries spend more money on health, life expectancy of the population increases.

Notice that the relationship in this chart seems to follow a pattern of 'diminishing returns': the increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in healthcare expenditure decreases as expenditure increases. This means the proportional highest gains are achieved in countries with low baseline levels of spending. This pattern is similar to that observed <a href="/life-expectancy/#life-expectancy-and-gdp">between life expectancy and per capita income</a>.

The countries are color-coded by world region, as per the inserted legends. Many of the green countries (Sub-Saharan Africa) achieved remarkable progress over the last 2 decades: health spending often increased substantially and life expectancy in many African countries increased by more than 10 years. The most extreme case is Rwanda, where life expectancy has increased from 32 to 64 years since 1995 (which was one year after the Rwandan genocide). The graph also shows that the African countries that suffered the most under the HIV/AIDS epidemic ‚Äì Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa ‚Äì experienced a decline of life expectancy from which they have not yet recovered.

The two most populous countries of the world ‚Äì India and China ‚Äì are emphasized by larger arrows. It is interesting to see that in 1995 China achieved good health outcomes at comparatively low levels of health spending.

The association between health spending and increasing life expectancy also holds for rich countries in Europe, Asia, and North America in the upper right corner of the chart. The US is an outlier that achieves only a comparatively short life expectancy considering the fact that the country has by far the highest health expenditure of any country in the world (we will get back to this aspect further below).

You can also explore this relationship between healthcare spending and child mortality in an <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-vs-healthcare-expenditure">interactive visualization</a>.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-life-expectancyl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8304" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/health-exp-vs-life-expectancyl-750x525.png" alt="health-exp-vs-life-expectancyl" width="750" height="525" /></a>

<h4>How strong is the link between healthcare expenditure and child mortality?</h4>
The following visualization presents the relationship between <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> ‚Äì measured as the share of children dying before their fifth birthday ‚Äì and healthcare expenditure per capita. Global data on health expenditure per capita is available since 1995 and in this chart we show the level of both measures in the first and last year for which data is available. The arrows connect these two observations, thereby showing the change over time for all countries in the world. We can see that child mortality is declining as more money is spent on health.

Focusing on change over time we can see a particularly striking fact: while there is huge inequality in levels ‚Äì child mortality in the best-performing countries is almost 100-times lower than in the worst ‚Äì inequality in trends is surprisingly stable. Specifically, if you look at the paths over time it is surprising how little heterogeneity there is between very different countries in the world. No matter whether it is a rich country in Europe or a much poorer country in Africa, the proportional decline in child mortality associated with a proportional increase in health expenditure is remarkably similar.

The visualization also shows the very high global inequality in health spending per capita that is still prevalent today. In the Central African Republic only 25 international-$ are spent per capita while on the other end of the distribution, in the US, 9,403 international-$ are spent. The ratio between the two countries is 376; on average Americans spent more on health per day than a person in the Central African Republic spends in an entire year. This is a very large gap, considering that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/#international-gdp-comparisons-market-vs-ppp-exchange-rates">International-$</a> are adjusted for price differences between countries ‚Äì if price differences were not taken into account, and the spending would have been expressed in US-$ by simply using the exchange rate between the different currencies, the difference would be even larger.

You can also explore this relationship between healthcare spending and child mortality in an <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-health-expenditure">interactive visualization</a>.

The results here are similar to the strong correlation between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy that we noted in the previous section.

<h4>Cross-country evidence suggests substantial health returns to healthcare investment</h4>
The above-mentioned cross-sectional relationships cannot be interpreted causally because countries differs in a number of ways that simultaneously affect health outcomes and health expenditure. Income is one of them. But we can get a step closer by concentrating on countries with similar income per capita, and looking at changes across time for each country, which eliminates the potential confounding effect of country-specific time-invariant factors.

The following graph visualizes the relationship between life expectancy and health expenditure, for a number of OECD countries across the period 1970-2014. Two points are worth mentioning. Firstly, all countries in this graph have followed an upward trajectory (life expectancy increased as health expenditure increased), but the U.S. stands out as an exception following a much flatter trajectory; gains in life expectancy from additional health spending in the U.S. were much smaller than in the other high-income countries, particularly since the mid-1980s. And secondly, the gains for all countries (except for the U.S.) were not diminishing, as in the previous graph. This suggests that there are many other factors affecting life expectancy, that are not determined by healthcare spending. Indeed, as we have pointed out before, healthcare is just one of many inputs to produce health.

<h6>Life expectancy vs. health expenditure over time, 1970-2014[ref]Graph produced by Max Roser on 25 July 2016 using <a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm">OECD data on health spending</a> and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN">World Bank data on life expectancy at birth</a>.</h6>
The definition of health spending given by the OECD is the following: "Health spending measures the final consumption of health care goods and services (i.e. current health expenditure) including personal health care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services (prevention and public health services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments. Health care is financed through a mix of financing arrangements including government spending and compulsory health insurance (‚Äúpublic‚Äù) as well as voluntary health insurance and private funds such as households‚Äô out-of-pocket payments, NGOs and private corporations (‚Äúprivate‚Äù). This indicator is presented as a total and by type of financing (‚Äúpublic‚Äù, ‚Äúprivate‚Äù, ‚Äúout-of-pocket‚Äù) and is measured as a share of GDP, as a share of total health spending and in USD per capita (using economy-wide PPPs)."[/ref]</h6>

The ever-elusive question of causality is not fully addressed in the analysis above (the issue of time varying unobservables and potential simultaneity remains), but the presented visualizations are nevertheless indicative of a clear and strong relationship; the health returns to healthcare investment suggested by the figures above are substantial, particularly for low-income countries. Indeed, these returns coupled with the returns estimated for conditional-cash-transfer programs in low and middle income countries,[ref]Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are increasingly common in the developing world. There is substantial evidence suggesting that CCTs have a significant impact on the intended outcomes, typically schooling, health, infant mortality, child labor, and poverty reduction. For an overview of CCTs and their impacts in Latin America ‚Äì the region that pioneered large-scale CCTs ‚Äì see Handa, S., &amp; Davis, B. (2006). The experience of conditional cash transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean. Development policy review, 24(5), 513-536.[/ref] suggest that with current world-wide resources ‚Äì suitably targeted ‚Äì it could be feasible to drastically reduce world inequality in health outcomes and achieve the so-called "grand convergence".[ref]A recent report commissioned by The Lancet, using evidence similar to what we discuss here, concludes that "[a] unique characteristic of our generation is that collectively we have the financial and the ever-improving technical capacity to reduce infectious, child, and maternal mortality rates to low levels universally by 2035, to achieve a ‚Äúgrand convergence‚Äù in health. With enhanced investments to scale up health technologies and systems, these rates in most low-income and middle-income countries would fall to those presently seen in the best-performing middle-income countries."

<!--------------DATA QUALITY-------------------------->
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Measurement</h2>
<h3>Relationship between sources</h3>
The main source of data on international healthcare expenditure is the World Health Organisation (WHO), more specifically the <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database">global health expenditure database</a>. This is the same data published by the World Bank (World Development Indicators) and <a href="https://www.gapminder.org">Gapminder</a>. It is also the source of the health expenditure tables in the World Health Statistics Report and the WHO Global Health Observatory; and it is used as an input to the Development Assistance for Health Database from the IHME.[ref]IHME collects budget, revenue, and expenditure data for 39 global health channels in order to estimate flows of development assistance for health. They use WHO estimates to then calculate how these flows compare to total expenditure in source and recipient countries.[/ref]

WHO data is produced mainly from national reports, but it also relies on reports from international organizations. The health statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), specifically the <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA">Health Expenditure and Financing Dataset</a>, are one of the inputs used by the WHO. Other important inputs from international organizations are the EUROSTAT database and the United Nations national accounts statistics. Since the WHO relies on a number of sources, its estimates do not always coincide with e.g. national statistics or OECD reports.

Another, related but different source of healthcare expenditure data, is the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), which publishes the Statistics of Public Expenditure for Economic Development (SPEED). This source relies primarily on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
<h3>Definitions</h3>
In the WHO's global health expenditure database (GHED), total expenditure on health is calculated as the sum of public health expenditure (also referred to as general government expenditure) and private health expenditure. The former is calculated by adding up all outlays paid by government entities (ministries, parastatal organizations or social security agencies), regardless of the source (so includes in principle any donor funding passing through them). The latter is calculated by adding up outlays for health by private entities (households, commercial health insurance, non-profit institutions). The WHO produces an <a href="http://apps.who.int/nha/database/DocumentationCentre/GetFile/52869001/en">Indicator Codebook</a> that provides detailed information about the definitions of all of the variables in their dataset.
<h3>Measurement limitations</h3>
The GHED has been maintained for the past ten years with the intent of providing comparable expenditure figures across countries and time, and its estimates rely on national health accounts based on reports from ministries, central banks, national statistics offices and international agencies such as the OECD. Since not all countries have (or update) national health accounts, the GHED's estimates often require imputation for missing values. Lu et al. (2010)[ref]Lu, C., Schneider, M. T., Gubbins, P., Leach-Kemon, K., Jamison, D., &amp; Murray, C. J. (2010). <a href="http://environmentportal.in/files/Public%20financing%20of%20health%20in%20developing%20countries.pdf">Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis</a>. The Lancet, 375(9723), 1375-1387.[/ref] provide an excellent account of the quality of the resulting estimates. Their conclusion is that the WHO's adjustment process requires substantial imputations for missing data; and that the distinction between actual reported data and imputed estimates is not clearly stated in their published tables. After reviewing the methodology used by the WHO, the authors concluded that the imputation methods are not standardised, and that the imputations are often based on the assumption that the ratio of government health spending to general government spending remains constant with time.

As mentioned before, the IMF also tracks public spending on health, and is one of the underlying sources used by the WHO for their GHED estimates. Lu et al. (2000) compare IMF reports with WHO estimates and conclude that the correlation between them is only 0.65. They argue the discrepancies arise because IMF values are more likely to represent data from ministries of finance than from ministries of health.

Apart from the above-mentioned issues, international cross-country comparisons of healthcare financing estimates are also problematic due to lack of consistency in classification of expenditures, especially on the borderline of health services. Even across OECD countries, where there is a framework of harmonised accounting, there are issues of completeness and comparability, particularly across time.[ref]See, for instance, the report <a href="http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/Improving-Estimates-of-Spending-on-Administration.pdf">Guidelines to improve estimates of expenditure on health administration and health insurance</a> [/ref] An example of this problem is the classification of care for disabilities. Culver and Newhouse (2000) mention that expenditure on intellectual developmental disabilities is not included in the healthcare figures from Denmark and Sweden after 1985, but it is included in the figures from Finland, Iceland and Norway.

More precisely, it is the monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country or region in a specific time period. While the definition of GDP is straightforward, accurately measuring it is a surprisingly difficult undertaking. Moreover, any attempts to make comparisons over time and across borders are complicated by price, quality and currency differences. This article covers the basics of GDP data and highlights many of the pitfalls associated with intertemporal and spatial comparisons.
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2>
There are many reasons why we might be interested in the size of an economy, its performance over time, or its relative performance compared to other countries. GDP is the most common way of measuring the size of an economy.

GDP is published in a country's National Accounts. These statistics comply to protocols laid down in the 1993 version of the Systems of National Accounts, SNA93.

The SNA93 established the 'production boundary', a crucial definition of what is and is not included in GDP figures:
<ul>
 	<li>included are all goods and services that are exchanged,</li>
 	<li>included are all goods that are not exchanged (for example food produced for home consumption)</li>
 	<li>but excluded are<em> services</em> that are not exchanged. Among these excluded services are food preparation, education of children at home, and minor home repairs.
<ul>
 	<li>An important exception to the services that are included is the housing services consumed by owner-occupiers. This service is imputed (imputed rent) and included in the GDP figure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>GDP per capita and average incomes</h3>

In principle there are three equivalent ways to calculate GDP:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Production</strong>: the value of final outputs produced in an economy less the value of all the inputs used in their production</li>
 	<li><strong>Expenditure</strong>: the expenditure on final goods and services produced in an economy by households, corporations and governments</li>
 	<li><strong>Income</strong>: the income earned by individuals and businesses from the production of goods and services in the economy</li>
</ol>
It theory these three measures should be equal; they constitute an accounting identity. A company's revenue is the income it generates from selling the goods and services it produces to consumers; yet that same revenue is also the expenditure of consumers on those goods and services. Paul Krugman makes the point that "our income mostly comes from selling things to each other. Your spending is my income, and my spending is your income."[ref]Paul Krugman. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/opinion/krugman-the-austerity-agenda.html">The Austerity Agenda</a>. The New York Times (2012).[/ref] This symmetry allows us to use GDP to approximate average incomes by dividing GDP by the total population. In reality, average incomes and GDP per capita will not be equal.[ref]There are many reasons why this is the case. One reason is due to the biases coming from the way GDP is defined. GDP does not include income earned abroad by the citizens of a country but includes domestic production by foreign companies (which may be used to pay shareholders abroad). Another issue is that the total population of a country will include both workers and those outside the labour force.[/ref]

<h3>Real GDP: adjusting for inflation in intertemporal comparisons</h3>
Nominal GDP is a measure of the value of output produced in a country or region over a specified period (usually one year). The value of output is composed of two factors: the volume produced and the price,
[latex]
\[GDP=P \times V,
\][/latex]
where [latex]P[/latex] represents the price of output and [latex]V[/latex] represents the volume of output. Therefore increases to GDP are either the result of more output, higher prices or a combination of the two. When looking at the performance of a single economy over time it is important that we control for price effects since they can mask changes to the value of output. In these cases we adjust for the price changes and look at real GDP. The real GDP is constructed by 'deflating' the nominal GDP by a price index that tracks changes to prices in the economy relative to a chosen base year. This transformation attempts to isolate volume changes by eliminating price effects.

However, it is not just prices that change over time. The very products and services that we produce and buy change. Technological progress has meant that the goods and services available today are invariably superior to those available several hundred years ago, with almost no example to the contrary. The introduction of new goods and services creates serious problems for intertemporal comparisons of wealth that are most relevant today; it is less of a problem for the long pre-modern world when almost all economic production consisted of¬†food, shelter and clothing. To emphasise this point consider the following example: In 1836 the richest man in the world was probably Nathan Rothschild. Rothschild could afford whatever he wanted - every good and service available in the world of 1836. Yet in that same year, the 56 year old died of an infection that is curable today by cheap antibiotics.

WW Norton &amp; Company, 1999.[/ref]
<h3>Quality changes</h3>
The Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi report explains "Quality change can be very rapid in areas like information and communication technologies. There are also products whose quality is complex, multi-dimensional and hard to measure, such as medical services, educational services, research activities and financial services. Difficulties also arise in 1. Evidence and references in support of the claims presented in this Summary are presented in a companion technical report. 22 SHORT NARRATIVE ON THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT collecting data in an era when an increasing fraction of sales take place over the internet and at sales as well as discount stores. As a consequence, capturing quality change correctly is a tremendous challenge for statisticians, yet this is vital to measuring real income and real consumption, some of the key determinants of people‚Äôs well-being. Under-estimating quality improvements is equivalent to over-estimating the rate of inflation, and therefore to underestimating real income. For instance, in the mid-1990s, a report reviewing the measurement of inflation in the United States (Boskin Commission Report) estimated that insufficient accounting for quality improvements in goods and services had led to an annual overestimation of inflation by 0.6%. This led to a series of changes to the US consumer price index."[ref]Stiglitz, Joseph, Sen, Amartya, &amp; Fitoussi, Jean-Paul (2009) ‚Äì <a href="http://www.insee.fr/fr/publications-et-services/dossiers_web/stiglitz/doc-commission/RAPPORT_anglais.pdf">Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress</a>.[/ref]

The two most common price indices used to deflate incomes and nominal GDP are:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong>: The basket is used measure the price changes of the goods and services consumed by the typical household. The typical household consumption basket will vary from country-to-country due to different preferences and income levels as well as over time as new technologies emerge and preferences change. CPI indices are produced by national statistical agencies, with one major exception being the European Union‚Äôs Harmonised CPI (HCPI). The HCPI uses consistent definitions for all Eurozone members to aid comparability.The CPI used to adjust household incomes tracks changes to the price of a basket of goods that the typical household purchases. It is measuring the price changes of <em>consumption</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong>GDP deflator</strong>: The GDP deflator also called National Accounts deflator measures the purchasing power relative to the prices of all domestically produced final goods and services in an economy. It is measuring the price changes of domestic <em>production</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Differences between CPI and GDP deflator</h4>
The CPI index measures price changes of consumption whereas the GDP deflator measures price changes of domestic production.

Consequently there are several important differences of the two price indices:[ref]FrancÃßois Lequiller, Derek Blades (2006) ‚Äì <a href="http://www.oecd.org/std/UNA-2014.pdf">Understanding National Accounts, second edition</a>, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[/ref]
<ul>
 	<li>Unlike the CPI, the GDP deflator does not adjust for changes of goods that are imported from other countries and the price changes of import prices are not directly taken into account.</li>
 	<li>Secondly, the GDP deflator covers capital goods, goods that are not bought by consumers.</li>
 	<li>The CPI is also available monthly for most countries, while the GDP deflator is mostly available only quarterly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Composition of the bundle of goods and services measured in the CPI</h4>
The following chart displays the composition of the German CPI basket of goods. The basket used is chosen to reflect the expenditure of the typical household, and changes to the CPI index over time reflect changes to the prices the typical consumer will face. The typical household consumption basket will vary from country-to-country due to preferences as well as over time as new technologies emerge and preferences change.[ref]In 2012 the UK statistical agency changed the composition of this basket of goods to better reflect the typical consumption basket of households. Tablet computers were added demonstrating the effect of new technologies, while boiled sweets were removed reflecting changing preferences.

<h3>International GDP Comparisons: market vs. PPP exchange rates</h3>
In order to highlight the difficultly of making international comparisons between countries, consider the average income of somebody living in India compared with the US.

In 2011 the average Indian earned 72,000 rupees, while the average American earned $50,000. Since the average incomes are stated in different currencies, comparing the numerical value is meaningless and does not help us determine who is richer and by how much. Converting the rupee amount into US dollars using market exchange rates gives us an average income of $1,500 in India. This number is over 33 times smaller than the income of the average American!

However, it is obvious that the cost of living in the US is much higher than in India, which implies that the comparison of incomes made at market exchange rates is also not a fair comparison of how rich or poor the people really are in comparison.[ref]The fact that the income ratio between a high and low income country is systematically exaggerated by GDP conversion at the market exchange rates is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_effect">Penn Effect</a>.[/ref] A solution is to convert the amounts using the <em>Purchasing Power Parity</em> (PPP) exchange rate. This conversion takes into account differences in the price levels of both countries. Making the PPP-adjustment reveals that the average income of someone living in India is $4,800 (international dollars), only 10 times smaller than in the US. The precise nature of PPP adjustments is explained in the section below.

This does not mean that comparisons of GDP evaluated at market exchange rates are uninformative. In fact, when comparing financial flows, PPP-adjustments are meaningless and GDP evaluated at the market exchange rate is the most appropriate measure. When comparing development and living standards, the converse is true since we need to eliminate price effects.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ourworldindata_gdp-ppp-per-capita.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6139" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ourworldindata_gdp-ppp-per-capita-750x524.png" alt="PPP-adjusted GDP per capita in India and the US" width="750" height="524" /></a>
<h3>PPP-adjusted GDP: spatial comparisons</h3>
GDP comparisons made using market exchange rates fail to reflect differences in the purchasing power of different currencies. In general, prices are higher in developed economies,[ref]This fact is explained by the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balassa%E2%80%93Samuelson_effect">Balassa‚ÄìSamuelson effect</a>.[/ref] and so exchange rate adjusted GDP measures will underestimate the size of low income economies.

In a simplified world, the prices of traded goods are determined by global demand and supply forces, while the prices of non-traded goods are determined by local demand and supply forces. Since wages and salaries are lower in developing countries, the prices of non-traded goods also tend to be lower. This feature is missed by exchange rate adjusted GDP calculations as no distinction is made between traded and non-traded goods. In a world where all goods are traded, exchange rate adjusted GDP would be a more informative way to make international comparisons. Nevertheless, another complicating factor is that exchange rates are highly volatile and determined by currency speculation, interest rates and international capital flows.

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustments to GDP are an attempt to isolate differences in the volume of output of two economies. That is, they eliminate disparities in the price levels of different economies. A PPP exchange rate can be thought of as the cost ratio of a comparable (but not identical) basket of goods in two countries. Hence, the methodology is analogous to that used in computing CPI inflation to calculate real GDP, except that here the comparisons are made between countries rather than over time. More precisely, PPP-adjusted GDP is a spatial measure and not a temporal one like real GDP: a base country is used as opposed to a base year. The US dollar is the most common unit of currency used to make international comparisons and, for clarity, PPP-adjusted quantities are quoted in international or Geary-Khamis dollars.[ref] Roy C. Geary and Salem Hanna Khamis were economic statisticians that proposed this approach for comparisons.[/ref]

We can decompose the GDP ratio of two economies into[latex]
\[
\frac{GDP_{A}}{GDP_{B}}=\frac{P_{A}}{P_{B}}\times\frac{C_{A}}{C_{B}}\times\frac{V_{A}}{V_{B}},
\][/latex]
where [latex]P_{X}[/latex] is the price level in country [latex]X[/latex], [latex]C_{X}[/latex] is the currency level in country [latex]X[/latex], and [latex]V_{X}[/latex] is the volume of output (real output) in country [latex]X[/latex]. When making international comparisons we are interested in the ratio of output volume. It is possible to remove the currency differences by using the exchange rate to convert the GDP into a common currency, but this would leave price level differences. The PPP exchange rate adjusts for both the currency and the price level ratio.
<h4>The creation of PPPs by the International Comparisons Programme (ICP)</h4>
The PPPs that are used in international comparisons today are created by the International Comparisons Programme (ICP) conducted by the World Bank. The latest round of the ICP was completed in 2014 and has estimated PPPs for 2011. The study covers 199 countries and is the most extensive study of PPPs ever conducted.

Since the research is highly intensive and requires cooperation with many different countries and statistical agencies, the existing PPP data is sparse (8 benchmark years since the first ICP study in 1970). What is more, the methodology used and the group of participating countries has differed between each round of the ICP. There are six years separating the most recent ICP estimates (2011 and 2005). Her is a <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPINT/Resources/270056-1183395201801/Summary-of-Results-and-Findings-of-the-2011-International-Comparison-Program.pdf" target="_blank">detailed explanation of the methodology and findings of the 2011 ICP</a>.

<h4>Computing PPP-adjusted GDP for years for which no ICP data is available</h4>

Computing PPP-adjusted GDP for years where ICP data is available is straightforward, however, in years where there is no data, there is no consensus regarding the best way to produce estimates.

Since PPP is a spatial measure, each ICP estimate is indexed to a benchmark year. Producing PPP-adjusted GDP estimates for non-benchmark years requires either extrapolation of PPP-estimates from a single round of ICP data, interpolation between different rounds or a combination of the two. Extrapolation takes the PPP-adjusted GDP in a single year and assumes that it evolves according to real GDP growth rates or the inflation ratio of the country of interest with the US. Interpolation attempts to "fill-in the gaps" using observed ICP rounds in conjunction with inflation or growth data according to some statistical model. The two figures presented below are designed to aid understanding of these two methods.

Understanding the methodology and purpose of each dataset is important when conducting data analysis. The four most important data sets for PPP-adjusted GDP data have the following methodology:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>World Bank data</strong>: Extrapolates from the most recent ICP round using national accounts deflators. The data and a brief description of the methodology can be found at <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PRVT.PP" target="_blank">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PRVT.PP</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>Since the data is extrapolated from the 2011 ICP, data is only presented for the years 1990-2014 as any further extrapolation is likely to give unreliable estimates. This dataset is most useful when considering the very recent past as the 2011 ICP round uses the most sophisticated methodology to date. It also has the advantage of being extrapolated forward in time to 2014.</li>
 	<li>Notes from the documentation: "For most economies PPP figures are extrapolated from the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP) benchmark estimates or imputed using a statistical model based on the 2011 ICP."</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Penn World Tables</strong>: Interpolates and extrapolates using national accounts deflators. The methodology used can be found in the documentation available at <a href="http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/pwt-8.1" target="_blank">http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/pwt-8.1</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>This dataset is most commonly used for statistical analysis by economists and covers the years 1950-2011. It is arguably the most reliable, long-run data available on PPP-adjusted GDP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Gapminder</strong>: Interpolates and extrapolates using real growth rates. The <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/documentation/documentation/gapdoc001_v9.pdf" target="_blank">methodology used can be found in the documentation</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>Gapminder aims to give the widest coverage possible at the expense of robust estimates. Much of the historic data has been estimated from trends and other For this reason, we present the data here for the purposes of graphical presentation and not as fact.</li>
 	<li>Notes from the documentation: "The main purpose of the data is to produce graphical presentations that display the magnitude of income disparities in the world over time... Hence we discourage the use of this data set for statistical analysis... The observations for the period before 1950 are, in the majority of cases, based on rough estimates within a range of likely values. In many cases we have no information, what-so-ever, on the relative ranking of countries."</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Maddison Project</strong>: Data is drawn from various sources. A complete list of sources can be found in the documentation available at <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm</a>.
<ul>
 	<li>This dataset has many different sources and is curated by the project team. Although the long-run data is much less reliable than more recent estimates, the more rigorous nature of the estimates allows for better spatial comparisons.</li>
 	<li>Notes from the documentation: "The Maddison Project database places the emphasis more on the international comparability of the estimates than on their consistency over time."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undernourishment before 1990</h3>
We do not have much quantitative information on malnourishment before 1990.

In 2006 the FAO stated the following prevalence of undernourishment in the developing world:
1969-71: 37%¬†¬† ¬†1979-81: 28%¬†¬† ¬†1990-92: 20%¬†¬† ¬†2001-03:17%[ref]Food and Agriculture Organization Agricultural and Development Economics Division. ‚ÄúThe State of Food Insecurity in the World, 2006 : Eradicating world hunger ‚Äì taking stock ten years after the World Food Summit‚Äù. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006, p. 8.
http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0750e/a0750e00.htm

The original quote is "... a reduction in the proportion of undernourished people in the developing countries by¬†3 percentage points ‚Äì from 20 percent in 1990‚Äì92 to 17 percent in 2001‚Äì03. ... However, progress over this period¬†was slower than over the previous two decades, when the prevalence of undernourishment declined by¬†9 percent (from 37 percent to 28 percent) between 1969‚Äì71 and 1979‚Äì81 and by a further 8 percentage points (to 20 percent) between 1979‚Äì81 and 1990‚Äì92.

&nbsp;

Similar numbers - including estimates of the total number of undernourished people - were published in the 2010 report.[/ref]
The numbers for 1990 have since been corrected upwards but the FAO has not (to my knowledge) published new estimates for the time before 1990. For the correction <a href="#data-quality-definition">see below</a>.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
Here I present the definitions used by the FAO.[ref]Specifically FAO, IFAD &amp; WFP (2013) ‚Äì¬†The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013 - The multiple dimensions of food security, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) or of the World Food Programme (WFP), FAO, Rome, 2013. Online <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3434e/i3434e.pdf">here</a>.[/ref] I have specified when I have used a different definition above.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Malnutrition</strong> is defined as an 'abnormal physiological condition caused by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive consumption of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. Malnutrition includes undernutrition and overnutrition
as well as micronutrient deficiencies.'
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Overnourishment</strong> is defined as 'food intake that is continuously in excess of dietary energy requirements'.</li>
 	<li><strong>Undernourishment</strong> is 'a state, lasting for at least one year, of inability to acquire enough food, defined as a level of food intake insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements'.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
In the FAO report 'hunger' is synonymous with 'chronic undernourishment'.

<strong>Consequences of <em>Undernourishment</em></strong>

The consequence of undernourishment is called <strong>Undernutrition.</strong> And the FAO names four outcomes of undernourishment, and/or poor absorption and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed as a result of repeated infectious disease.

These are:
<ul>
 	<li>Being <strong>underweight</strong> for one‚Äôs age.
<ul>
 	<li>Underweight is defined as 'low weight for age in children, and BMI of less than 18.5 in adults'.[ref]The body mass index (BMI) is 'the ratio of weight-for-height measured as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres'.[/ref]</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>For children, two consequences of undernourishment are:
<ul>
 	<li>being 'too short for one‚Äôs age' which is called <strong>stunting,</strong></li>
 	<li>being 'dangerously thin for one‚Äôs height'¬† which is called <strong>wasting,</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>and being 'deficient in vitamins and minerals' which is called '<strong>micronutrient malnutrition</strong>'.</li>
</ul>

Literacy is a key skill and a key measure of a population‚Äôs education. In this entry we discuss historical trends, as well as recent developments in literacy.

From a historical perspective, literacy levels for the world population have risen drastically in the last couple of centuries. While only 12% of the people in the world could read and write in 1820, today the share has reversed: only 17% of the world population remains illiterate.

Despite large improvements in the expansion of basic education, and the continuous reduction of education inequalities, there are substantial challenges ahead. The poorest countries in the world, where basic education is most likely to be a binding constraint for development, still have very large segments of the population who are illiterate. In Niger, for example, the literacy rate of the youth (15-24 years) is only 36.5%.

<h3>Historical Perspective</h3>
<!------------------------------------------>
<h4>Global literacy has grown substantially in the last two centuries</h4>

While the earliest forms of written communication date back to about 3,500-3,000 BCE, literacy remained for centuries a very restricted technology closely associated with the exercise of power. It was only until the Middle Ages that book production started growing and literacy among the general population slowly started becoming important in the Western World.[ref]An overview of the academic literature on the historical origins and spread of literacy can be found in Easton, P. (2014). Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Paris, France. Available online from <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org">http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002252/225258e.pdf</a>[/ref] In fact, while the ambition of universal literacy in Europe was a fundamental reform born from the Enlightment, it took centuries for it to happen. It was only in the 19th and 20th centuries that rates of literacy approached universality in early-industrialized countries. 

The following visualization presents estimates of world literacy for the period 1800-2014. As we can see, literacy rates grew constantly but rather slowly until the beginning of the twentieth century. And the rate of growth really climbed after the middle of the 20th century, when the expansion of basic education became a global priority. You can read more about the expansion of education systems around the world in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#historical-perspective">Financing Education</a>.

<h4>When did literacy start growing in Europe?</h4>

The following visualization shows the spread of literacy in Europe since the 15th century, based on estimates from Buringh and Van Zanden (2009)[ref] Buringh, E., & Van Zanden, J. L. (2009). Charting the ‚ÄúRise of the West‚Äù: Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, a long-term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries. The Journal of Economic History, 69(02), 409-445.[/ref]. As it can be seen, the rising levels of education in Europe foreshadowed the emergence of modern societies. 

Particularly fast improvements in literacy took place across Northwest Europe in the period 1600-1800. As we discuss below, widespread literacy is considered a legacy of the Age of Enlightenment.

<h4>The ambition of universal literacy in Europe was a reform born of the Enlightenment</h4>

We have already pointed out that Northwest Europe made significan improvements in literacy in the period 1600-1800. Here we use historical estimates from England ‚Äì a country that was very much at the center of the development of modernity ‚Äì to show how the process towards universal literacy took place. Specifically, the following graph from Clark (2008)[ref]Clark, G. (2008). A farewell to alms: a brief economic history of the world. Princeton University Press.[/ref] shows how modernization ‚Äì characterized by science, technological progress, freedom and tolerance ‚Äì was enabled by improving the education of ever-larger shares of the population. It also shows how this process of expansion led to a reduction in education gender inequality.

<h4>In the US, the expansion of literacy helped reduce within-country inequalities</h4>

The expansion of literacy in early-industrialized countries helped reduce within-country inequalities. In the preceding visualization we showed that England virtually closed literacy gender gaps by 1900. Here we provide evidence of literacy gaps across races in the US. 

The following visualization shows illiteracy rates by race for the period 1870-1979. As we can see, in order to reach near universal levels of literacy, the US had to close the race gap. This was eventually achieved around 1980.

<h4>The global expansion of literacy has helped reduce inequalities both within and across countries</h4>

In our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#education-inequality-is-falling-around-the-world">Financing Education</a>, we show that an important consequence of the global education expansion is a reduction in education inequality across the globe.

Here we want to provide evidence of how inequality in literacy, specifically, has been going down. The following visualization shows literacy by age group for different country groups. The left panel corresponds to 1980, and the right panel to 1995. 

We can see that all regions made substantial progress across the board ‚Äì so the series in 1995 are much more compressed towards the top than in 1980.

We can also see that younger generations are progressively better educated than older generations. And it is particularly promising that this intergenerational change is happening especially quickly in the least educated regions of our world:  notice how the slopes of the lines in the least educated countries become progressively steeper. We come back to an analysis of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/literacy-new/#in-most-countries-there-are-large-generational-literacy-gaps-favouring-the-young">intergenerational literacy gaps below</a>.  

In Sub-Saharan Africa in 1995, for example, the literacy rate for the youngest population group was more than three times higher than that for the oldest population group. It may seem obvious, but it is still worth pointing out that in all the statistics shown here we have never seen a reversal of this positive development.

<h3>Recent Developments</h3>
<!------------------------------------------>
<h4>Latin America has made huge improvements in literacy in the last century</h4>

As pointed out above, Europe pioneered the expansion of basic education ‚Äì but global literacy rates only started really climbing in the second half of the 20th century, when the expansion of basic education became a global priority. Here we present evidence of important recent achievements in Latin America, where literacy has dramatically increased in the past century.

As it can be seen, many nations have gained 40-50 percentage points in literacy during this period. 

Despite these improvements, however, there is still a wide disparity between nations. Here you can see that, at the turn of the 21st century, half of the population in poor countries such as Haiti remains illiterate. This motivates the next visualization, where we discuss cross-country heterogeneity in more detail.

<h4>Global literacy is higher than ever ‚Äì but important challenges remain</h4>

The following interactive map shows literacy rates around the world, using recent estimates published in the CIA Factbook.  As it can be seen, all countries outside Africa (with the exception of Afghanistan) have literacy rates above 50%. 

Despite progress in the long run, however, large inequalities remain, notably between sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world. In Burkina Faso, Niger and South Sudan ‚Äì the African countries at the bottom of the rank ‚Äì literacy rates are still below 30%.


<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/literacy-rate-by-country" style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

<!------------------------------------------>
<h4>In most countries there are large generational literacy gaps favouring the young</h4>

To assess the extent to which progress can be expected in the years to come, it is convenient to break down literacy estimates by age groups. The following map, using data from UNESCO, shows such estimates for most countries in the world. 

As it can be seen, in the majority of nations there is a large difference in literacy rates across generations (you can change the map to show literacy rates for different groups by clicking on the corresponding buttons at the top).

These large differences across generations point to a global trend: the high literacy rate among the youth indicates that as time passes, the literacy rate for the overall population will continue to increase.

<!------------------------------------------>
<h4>Northern Africa and the Middle East have drastically improved literacy in just one generation</h4>

We highlighted above the fact that most low and middle income countries feature large differences in literacy rates across generations. The visualization below shows specifically how remarkably large these differences are in Northern Africa and the Middle East. Using UNESCO data, these maps show that in many countries in these regions, only less than a third of the older generation is literate ‚Äì while in contrast, more than 90% of the younger generation is literate.

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ourworldindata_literacy-rate-by-age-in-middle-east-and-northern-africa.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6122" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ourworldindata_literacy-rate-by-age-in-middle-east-and-northern-africa-750x534.png" alt="Literacy-Rate-by-Age-in-Middle-East-and-Northern-Africa" width="750" height="534" /></a>

The following scatter plot emphasises the point already made. As you can see, younger generations are more likely to be literate than older generations around the world ‚Äì but the largest gaps correspond mostly to countries in North Africa and the Middle East (these are the countries that are furthest on the top left).

<!------------------------CORRELATES---------------------->
<h2>Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</h2>

The visualization below shows, in two panels, a side-by-side comparison of long-term trends in school attendance and literacy.

We can see that in 1870 only one in four people in the world attended school, and this meant that only one in five were able to read. And global inequalities in access to education were very large. 

Today, in contrast, the global estimates of literacy and school attendance are above 80%, and the inequality between world regions ‚Äì while still existing ‚Äì is much lower.

We can see that two centuries ago only a small elite of the world population had the ability to read and write ‚Äì the best estimate is that 12% of the world population was literate. Over the course of the 19th century global literacy more than doubled. And over the course of the 20th century the world achieved rapid progress in education. More than 4 out of 5 people are now able to read. Young generations are better educated than ever before.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2>

<h3>Definitions and measurement today</h3>

According to a 1958 UNESCO resolution, literacy is defined as the ability to both read and write a short, simple statement about one's own life. Literacy rates are determined by literacy questions in a census or sample survey of a population, in standardized tests of literacy, or via extrapolation from statistics about school enrollment and educational attainment[ref]UNESCO 'Recommendation Concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics',¬†<a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001145/114584e.pdf">Records of the General Conference, tenth session, Paris, 1958: Resolutions</a>[/ref].


<h3>Measurement and estimation of historical literacy rates</h3>
Statistics of literacy rates for recent decades are published by statistical offices. For earlier periods, historians have to reconstruct data from other sources. The most common method is to calculate the share of those people who could sign official documents (e.g. court documents). Dittmar (2012)[ref] Dittmar, J. (2011). The welfare impact of a new good: The printed book. Department of Economics, American University.[/ref] notes that this only gives a lower bound of the estimate because the number of people who could read was higher than the number who could write. Allen (2003)[ref]Allen, R. C. (2003). Progress and poverty in early modern Europe. The Economic History Review, 56(3), 403-443.[/ref] takes a different approach and bases his estimates of literacy levels for early Europe on the level of urbanization.[ref]Buringh and Zanden (2009) ‚Äì referenced before ‚Äì compare their estimates with those from Allen (2003) and find only small discrepancies.[/ref]

The world is improving in almost every measurable way; fewer people are dying of disease, conflict and famine; more of us are receiving a basic education; the world is becoming more democratic; we live longer and lead healthier lives. So why is that we, mostly in the developed world, are pessimistic about our collective future? 

<h2>Individual Optimism and Social Pessimism</h2>

It is a peculiar empirical phenomenon that while people tend to be optimistic about their own future, they are deeply pessimistic about the future of their nation or the world. Tali Sharot, associate professor of psychology at UCL, has popularised the idea of an innate optimism bias built into the human brain.[ref]Sharot, Tali. <em>The Optimism Bias: A Tour of the Irrationally Positive Brain</em>. New York: Pantheon Books, 2011.

Sharot, Tali. <em>The Science of Optimism Why We're Hard-wired for Hope</em>. New York: Ted Conferences, 2012.[/ref] That is, we tend to be optimistic rather than realistic when considering our individual future. If you were to ask newlywed couples to estimate the probability they will divorce in the future, they would likely reject the possibility outright. Yet today roughly 40% of marriages in the UK end in divorce! Another example is asking smokers to estimate their chances of getting cancer and again, most would underestimate their risk. This optimism persists even when people are presented with the relevant statistics.

Consider the following graphs from the European Union's Eurobarometer surveys; they report people's expectations about their own personal job situation and of the economic situation in their home country. From the end of 1995 to the middle of 2015, around 60% of people predict that their job situation will remain the same, while 20% expect their situation to improve. Compare that with the response of the same group of individuals considering the future of the economic situation in their home country. Although far less stable, the results show that most people expect the economic situation in their home country to get worse or stay the same. The expectation that things are going to worsen nationally is correlated with recessions, yet there is remarkable stability in the results for individual expectations. Does the response to the question about national economic well being better correspond to an individual's true job prospects?

Now consider the degree to which the public's perception can diverge from the reality. In the US, survey evidence shows that most Americans believe crime is on the up, even in years where crime is falling or remains the same. Teen pregnancy is another area in which most Americans believe the situation is deteriorating. In fact, teen pregnancy has fallen 42% since 1990 and is at its lowest level in two decades.[ref]Most Americans think teen pregnancy is getting worse. Most Americans are wrong. The Washington Post (2013). Available online <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/01/most-americans-think-teen-pregnancy-is-getting-worse-most-americans-are-wrong/" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

This pattern is also observed on a larger scale. The first chart below shows how individuals in the UK respond to the question: "Thinking about ..., how much of a problem do you think each of the following are in your local area and in the whole of the UK?" Individuals tend to believe problems are more pronounced nationally than in their local area. The second chart shows how many individuals rate the environment in their local area as fairly or very bad, compared with the environment nationally and globally. Again, we observe a similar pattern for most countries.

How can we reconcile this individual optimism with social pessimism? Paul Dolan, professor of behavioural science at LSE, believes people respond pessimistically to questions about national or international performance for three reasons:

<ol style="font-size: medium; text-align: left; font-family:sans-serif;">
	<li>Individuals rarely think about grand issues such as the state of the nation or world, and so respond with an 'on-the-spot' answer that may not be well considered or even a true reflection of their beliefs.</li>
	<li>The framing can influence the individual's response. Moreover, the question itself may bias responses; 'who would bother to ask if everything were okay?'</li>
	<li>Responses to questions such as these (and more general questions about happiness or life satisfaction) are heavily influenced by ephemeral recent events.</li>
</ol>

This explanation suggests there is a problem of information. If we do not pay attention to human progress or development, then our judgement may suffer from a bias related to transient events or framing. <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/" target="_blank">The Gapminder Ignorance Project</a> suggests the reason for all this ignorance is: 



<blockquote>Statistical facts don‚Äôt come to people naturally. Quite the opposite. Most people understand the world by generalizing personal experiences which are very biased. In the media the ‚Äúnews-worthy‚Äù events exaggerate the unusual and put the focus on swift changes. Slow and steady changes in major trends don‚Äôt get much attention. Unintentionally, people end-up carrying around a sack of outdated facts that you got in school (including knowledge that often was outdated when acquired in school).</blockquote>



Another explanation put forward by Martin Seligman, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests a link between control and optimism. If we feel more in control of our lives, we tend to be happier, healthier and more optimistic about the future. This could explain the gap between individual and societal optimism: since we are in direct control of our own lives but not the destiny of the nation we feel more optimistic about ourselves.



<h2>Declinism</h2>

<h3>Declinism and Development</h3>

Declinism refers to the belief that a country or some other institution is in decline. Declinism was a prevalent feature of British political and economic history, whereby the decline of Britain as a world power was seen as the result of internal failures rather than international forces or global convergence. David Edgerton writes: "Declinism is beginning to appear as one of the last vestiges of imperial grandeur: for declinism holds, implicitly but clearly, that if Britain had done better it would have remained a much larger player on the world stage."[ref]
David Edgerton. "The Decline of Declinism." <em>The Business History Review</em>, Vol. 71, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 201-206. Available online at <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3116157" target="_blank">http://www.jstor.org/stable/3116157</a>[/ref] Today declinism in the United States is fashionable with many politicians. Donald Trump's campaign slogan for the 2016 Republican nomination election is "Make America Great Again!"

The major flaw in much of the declinist narrative is the failure to distinguish between absolute and relative changes. Between 2010-14, US real GDP growth rates have fluctuated between 1.5-2.5% and yet, the US economy was recently overtaken by the Chinese economy measured in PPP-adjusted terms.[ref]For more information on PPP-adjustments, please visit the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/gdp-data/" target="_blank">GDP data page</a>.[/ref] In many ways this may capture the reason why the most developed nations tend to believe that their economy is in decline: relative decline is interpreted as absolute decline. Unsurprisingly, new EU member states tend to be much more optimistic about the future. The four largest economies -- the UK, France, Germany and Italy -- are the most pessimistic. This pattern persists when considering economies at different stages of development: developing countries are more optimistic about the future, while developed ones tend to be pessimistic.

<h3>Declinism and Age: The Reminiscence Bump</h3>

One interesting explanation for declinism is that it is the result of the way we encode memories and what we remember. Firstly, researchers have long established a robust pattern in the age at which we retain the most memories. In old age, memories from our lives are not evenly distributed but instead concentrated in two regions. These regions are (1) memories formed in adolescence and early adulthood, between the ages of 10-30, and (2) recent memory of events. The following figure is a useful representation of this distribution.

Secondly, as we get older we tend to have fewer negative experiences and that we are more likely to remember the positive ones over the negative ones.[ref]Mara Mather, Laura L. Carstensen, Aging and motivated cognition: the positivity effect in attention and memory, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 10, October 2005, Pages 496-502, ISSN 1364-6613. Available online <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2005.08.005" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] This effect combined with the reminiscence bump could explain why declinism exists among older generations, and why your parents could never stand the music you listened to! The universality of this effect is highlighted by Harvey Daniels with the use of these quotes about the decline of the english language:[ref]Daniels, Harvey. <em>Famous last words: The American language crisis reconsidered</em>. Southern Illinois University Press, 1983.[/ref]
<ol style="font-size: medium; text-align: left; font-family:sans-serif;">
	<li>"The common language is disappearing. It is slowly being crushed to death under the weight of verbal conglomerate, a pseudospeech at once both pretentious and feeble, that is created daily by millions of blunders and inaccuracies in grammar, syntax, idiom, metaphor, logic, and common sense.... In the history of modern English there is no period in which such victory over thought-in-speech has been so widespread. Nor in the past has the general idiom, on which we depend for our very understanding of vital matters, been so seriously distorted." (A. Tibbets and C. Tibbets, <em>What's Happening to American English?</em>, <strong>1978</strong>)</li>

	<li>"From every college in the country goes up the cry, "Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate." Every high school is in disrepair because its pupils are so ignorant of the merest rudiments." (C. H. Ward, <strong>1917</strong>)</li>

	<li>"Unless the present progress of change [is] arrested...there can be no doubt that, in another century, the dialect of the Americans will become utterly unintelligible to an Englishman..." (Captain Thomas Hamilton, <strong>1833</strong>)</li>


	<li>"Our language is degenerating very fast." (James Beattie, <strong>1785</strong>)</li>

</ol>

What is even more surprising is that one of the earliest Sumerian tablets discovered and deciphered by modern scholars was a complaint by a teacher about his students' writing ability!

<h2>Why should we care?</h2>

There are three main reasons we should try to combat social pessimism and declinism. The first reason is simple; indicators of living standards are significantly improving around the world. By monitoring and researching these changes we can identify ways in which progress can be achieved. Over the long-run, say 50-100 years, human progress has been staggering with the benefits not confined to the richest or most powerful. The second reason is that if our perceptions of the reality are wrong, we can end up prioritising the wrong things and making ineffectual change. Finally, being optimistic can be good for your health, while having a pessimistic outlook can be detrimental to your health. 

<h3>Things Are Getting Better</h3>

With all the negative news stories and sensationalism that exists in the media it may be hard to believe things are improving. These events can be contextualised as short-term fluctuations in an otherwise positive global trend. Quantifying this progress and identifying its causes will help researchers develop successful strategies to combat the world's problems. Below is a selection of graphs showing just how much progress has been made over the centuries. More examples can be found on <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/" target="_blank">http://ourworldindata.org/data/</a>.

<h3>Perception and Priority</h3>

The public perception of these indicators matters because it directly influences the priorities of politicians. If, as in the example above, the public believes crime is increasing, it will demand more policing. But if crime is decreasing anyway, more policing is arguably an inefficient use of resources. This is why incorrect public perceptions can be a problem. The following figures underline just how sizable these effects can be and their causes. The first shows how spending on crime has moved with the public's confidence in the government's ability to crack down on crime. As the public's confidence fell, spending on crime increased and recorded crime fell; without any uptick in the public's confidence. Of those who believed crime was increasing, more than half suggested TV as a reason they believed there was more crime. In addition to this, just under half suggested newspapers were a factor.

Available online <a href="http://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/FoxVoteQJEAug07.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] DellaVigna and Kaplan looked at how the introduction of Fox News between 1996 and 2000 in different towns affected voting patterns and turnout in the Presidential election of 2000. They find "a significant effect of the introduction of Fox News on the vote share in Presidential elections between 1996 and 2000. Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News. Fox News also affected voter turnout and the Republican vote share in the Senate. Our estimates imply that Fox News convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote Republican, depending on the audience measure. The Fox News effect could be a temporary learning effect for rational voters, or a permanent effect for nonrational voters subject to persuasion."

Another dimension to this debate is the extent to which the perceived terrorism threat affects the willingness of individuals to trade-off civil liberties.[ref]Davis, Darren W., and Brian D. Silver. "Civil liberties vs. security: Public opinion in the context of the terrorist attacks on America." American Journal of Political Science 48, no. 1 (2004): 28-46. Available online <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00054.x/abstract" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] Darren Davis and Brian Silver find that "the greater people‚Äôs sense of threat, the lower their support for civil liberties." This effect is attenuated by the people's trust in government but fairly consistent across nearly all political affiliations and demographics.

<h3>Health Impact of Optimism and Pessimism</h3>

Studies have found a link between an individual's optimism/pessimism (measured by surveys) and their health outcomes. Julia Boehm and Laura Kubzansky reviewed over 200 published studies to investigate the link between a positive psychological outlook (optimism, life satisfaction and happiness) and cardiovascular health.[ref]Boehm, Julia K., and Laura D. Kubzansky. "The heart's content: the association between positive psychological well-being and cardiovascular health." <em>Psychological bulletin</em> 138, no. 4 (2012): 655. Available online <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/138/4/655/" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] They found that a positive psychological outlook was strongly associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease: ‚ÄúFor example, the most optimistic individuals had an approximately 50% reduced risk of experiencing an initial cardiovascular event compared to their less optimistic peers."[ref] Positive feelings may help protect cardiovascular health. Harvard School of Public Health (2012). Available online <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-04/hsop-pfm041312.php" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] Boehm et al. (2011) also find a link between optimism and the composition of cholesterol in the blood. Optimistic individuals had higher levels of good cholesterol and lower levels of triglycerides.[ref]Boehm, Julia K., Christopher Peterson, Mika Kivimaki, and Laura Kubzansky. "A prospective study of positive psychological well-being and coronary heart disease." <em>Health Psychology</em> 30, no. 3 (2011): 259. Available online <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/hea/30/3/259/" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]

Further research using data from the Women's Health Initiative found that over an eight year period, the most optimistic women had a 9% lower risk of developing coronary heart disease and a 14% lower risk of dying from any cause.[ref]Tindle, Hilary A., Yue-Fang Chang, Lewis H. Kuller, JoAnn E. Manson, Jennifer G. Robinson, Milagros C. Rosal, Greg J. Siegle, and Karen A. Matthews. "Optimism, cynical hostility, and incident coronary heart disease and mortality in the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative." <em>Circulation</em> 120, no. 8 (2009): 656-662. Available online <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/120/8/656.abstract" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] Similar results were also found by researchers writing in the <em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em>; using data from the Netherlands, they found that the most optimistic individuals had a 55% reduced risk of all-cause mortality and a 23% reduced risk of cardiovascular death.

<h3>Working Hours in Hunter-Gatherer and Other Premodern Societies</h3>
Anthropologic studies of hunter-gatherer and subsistence cultivation societies show that labor inputs are small. This can be seen from the table below taken from Clark.[ref]Clark, Gregory (2008). A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World. Princeton University Press.[/ref]

The author is surprised by the short work days especially because some societies, as the Hiwi from Venezuela often suffer from hunger and although they achieve 'high returns from each hour of work' they still generally forage for less than 2 hours.

Generally the work time in hunter-gatherer societies is lower than in agrarian societies.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Maternal Mortality in the Long Run</h3>
The chart shows how much rarer maternal mortality has become. Let‚Äôs look back a hundred years: Out of 100,000 child births about 500 to 1,000 ended with the death of the mother. This means every 100th to 200th birth led to the mother‚Äôs death. Since <a href="http://www.ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/fertility-rates/">women gave birth much more often than today</a> the death of the mother was a common tragedy. The decline of maternal mortality to around 10 per 100,000 is due to the modern scientific understanding of the cause of maternal mortality and the adoption of very simple practices. The common reason for the mother to die was puerperal fever (or childbed fever) which was caused by unhygienic medical staff and medical equipment by which the mother‚Äôs genital tract is infected during childbirth. It was the physician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> who first noticed the link between hygiene and the survival of mothers in the middle of the 19th century. He urged his colleagues to wash their hands with chlorinated lime solutions but was ignored. The germ theory of disease was not yet known and therefore¬† he could not explain why there should be a link between hygiene and the survival of women during childbirth. The rejection by the medical community of the time turned Semmelweis bitter and every conversation he had revolved around childbed fever. He was eventually committed to an mental asylum where he died a miserable death. He was never to see how right he was and never knew how many mother‚Äôs lives he saved! After Semmelweis‚Äô death, when Louis Pasteur developed the germ theory of diseases, the recommendations of Semmelweis were finally adopted and maternal mortality started to decrease. A procedure as simple as the doctor washing his hands meant that puerperal fever ‚Äì a killer of thousands of mothers ‚Äì declined sharply. We see the decline in Finland over the course of the 2nd half of the 19th century. In the 20th century the availability of antibiotics made it possible to treat cases of puerperal fever and the death of a mother is today fortunately very rare. As it is often the case we see that it is much harder for a pioneer to make advancements than for a country that catches up later. The decline of maternal mortality in Finland began in the middle of the 19th century and didn‚Äôt reach today‚Äôs low level more than a century later. Malaysia in contrast achieved this progress in only a few decades.
<h6>Maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births) over the long run ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The visualized data is taken from Claudia Hanson (2010) ‚Äì¬†Gapminder Documentation 010 - Documentation for Data on Maternal Mortality Historical information compiled for 14 countries (up to 200 years). The accompanying document and the data set from which I have taken this data is online <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd010/">here</a>. It shows the maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births). The indicator is defined as follows by the source: 'The number of maternal deaths divided by the number of live births in a given year, multiplied by 100,000. Maternal death is defined as the death of a women while pregnant or within the 42 days after termination of that pregnancy, regardless of the length and site of the pregnancy, from a cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy.' If data is given for time brackets of more than a year then I have plotted the observation at the midpoint of the bracket. Sri Lanka, which is included in the original source, was not included here as data before 1950 only refers to women in reproductive age (15-49).[/ref] <iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/MaternalMortality_LongRun_GapminderData/MaternalMortality_LongRun_GapminderData.html" width="100%" height="540" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
Childbed fever (puerperal sepsis) was a common cause for maternal mortality. It is a bacterial infection of the female reproductive tract¬† that can occur after giving birth. The introduction of antibiotics in the 1930s made it possible that¬† in those countries that had access to the new medicine the risk of dying of childbed fever was almost entirely¬†eradicated in the 30s and 40s.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
The <em>UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group</em> publishes <a href="http://www.maternalmortalitydata.org">MaternalMortalityData.org</a>. These data are published by the World Bank <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT">here</a>.
According to the report the data comes from several sources. In the best cases data from the civil registration systems were used directly to calculate the estimates of maternal mortality rates (MMRs). When these data were not available two-part multi-level regression model were used to estimate MMRs for all target years. The three selected predictor variables in the regression model are: GDP, the general fertility rate (GFR) and the proportion of skilled attendants at birth.

This entry presents the empirical research on the slow rise of democratic regimes over the last two centuries.

Democracies are distinct from autocratic countries in which political preferences cannot be expressed and citizens are not guaranteed civil liberties. Anocracies ‚Äì a term used often in this entry ‚Äì are regimes that fall in the middle of the spectrum of autocracies and democracies. Anocracies are countries which are not fully autocratic, but which can also not be called democratic.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Number of Democracies</h3>
The majority of the world's countries are now governed by democratic regimes, defined as systems with citizen political participation, constraints on the power of the executive, and a guarantee of civil liberties. The visualization below shows the slow increase of democratic countries over the last 200 years. The rise of democracies has been interrupted by the atrocities during the two World Wars ‚Äì many young democracies fell back to become autocratic ahead of the Second World War.
After 1945 the number of democracies has started to grow again, but the very dramatic shift towards a democratic world has been the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1989. By clicking on 'Autocracies' and 'Anocracies', you can also see that after 1989 the number of autocracies has decreased dramatically while the number of anocracies initially increased then has stayed fairly stable.
<h6>Number of democracies between 1800-2010[ref]</h6>
The source of the data is the polity IV dataset which is available online <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm">here</a>. I have only included countries with a population greater than 500,000.[/ref]

<h3>Share of World Population Living in Democracies</h3>
The mere number of democratic countries does not us how many people in the world actually enjoy democratic rights since the population in different countries varies hugely. Therefore it is more interesting to look at the number of people governed by different political regimes. This is shown in the chart below.
By clicking on 'Relative', the following graph shows the share of people living in different regimes over the last two centuries.
In the 19th century most people in the world lived in autocratically ruled countries or in countries that were colonized by imperial powers. This changed completely over the second half of the 20th centuries: Former colonies became independent and autocratic countries became democracies. By 1997 more than half of the world's population lived in democratic regimes, and that proportion has stayed fairly stable since.
We see a country by country breakdown below, but it is worth pointing out that 4 out of 5 people in the world that live in an autocracy live in China.

<h3>World maps of political regimes over 200 years</h3>
The world has changed: 2 centuries ago most countries were autocratically ruled or part of a colonial empire, today most countries are democracies. The map below shows the data for 2015, but you can move the slider at the bottom past to see this change over the last 2 centuries.
Most countries in Europe and the Americas have become democracies. Some parts of Africa - especially in the West and the South - have democratized and so have countries in Asia; India is the world's largest democracy. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Mongolia are all full democracies according to the Polity IV evaluation.

<h3>Political freedom is a very recent achievement</h3>
The following world map¬†of the age of democratic regimes¬†shows that a democratic world is only a very recent achievement. It also indicates that economic success goes together with political liberation. The countries that have democratized first are mostly those countries that first achieved economic growth. The present rates of economic growth in the poorer countries of the world therefore give hope for further democratization around the world.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h4>Countries with higher educational attainment in the past are more likely to have democratic political regimes today</h4>
A long-standing theory in political science stipulates that a country's level of education attainment is a key determinant of the emergence and sustainability of democratic political institutions, both because it promotes political participation at the individual level, and because it fosters a collective sense of civic duty.

Under this hypothesis, therefore, we should expect that education levels in a country correlate positively with measures of democratisation in subsequent years. The following visualization shows that this positive correlation is indeed supported by the data. As we can see, countries where adults had a higher average education level in 1970, are also more likely to have democratic political regimes today (you can read more about measures of democracy in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/democratisation">Democratization</a>).

As usual, these results should be interpreted carefully, because they do not imply a causal link: it does not prove that increasing education necessarily produces democratic outcomes everywhere in the world.
However, the academic research here does suggest that there is a causal link between education and democratization ‚Äì indeed, a number of empirical academic papers have found that this positive relationship remains after controlling for many other country characteristics (see, for example, Lutz, Crespo-Cuaresma, and Abbasi‚ÄêShavazi 2010[ref]Lutz, W., Crespo Cuaresma, J., &amp; Abbasi‚ÄêShavazi, M. J. (2010). Demography, education, and democracy: Global trends and the case of Iran. Population and Development Review, 36(2), 253-281.[/ref]).

It would be preferable to show the historical borders and the changes over time; the current solution is a limitation of our technical framework that cannot (yet) show border changes.<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/colonialism-and-imperialism" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Why we chose the Polity IV as the main source for democracy measures</h3>
<div>It is necessarily controversial to <span class="il">measure</span> a complex concept such as <span class="il">the type of a political regime</span> in a single metric. But since it can be useful to quantify the political regime characteristics so that it is possible to compare political regimes over time and between countries and to study the drivers and consequences of political regime change quantitatively. For example a field of study where this can be useful is studying the link between democratisation and the end of mass <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines/">famines</a>.</div>
<div>

A much cited, thorough evaluation of commonly used democracy measures has been presented by Munck and Verkuilen (2002).[ref]Munck and Verkuilen (2002) - Conceptualizing and Measuring Democracy Evaluating Alternative Indices. In Comparative Political Studies, 35, 1, 5--34.[/ref] Unfortunately the authors find a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of the empirical scope and the quality of the assessment in terms of conceptualization, measurement and aggregation. According to the authors, the Polity IV measures are a 'partial exception' of this tradeoff, and therefore I rely on these measures mostly in this entry. In general, the Polity IV defines democracy as a system which has institutions in which citizens can express their preferences, has constraints on the power of the executive, and a guarantee of civil liberties. It defines an autocracy as a system that restricts political participation by citizens, has executives chosen within the political elite, and executives with few institutional constraints.

</div>
<div>The Polity IV measure used here is certainly also questionable ‚Äì as would every other alternative ‚Äì but we chose it as my main source because based on our comparison with alternatives and the paper by Munck and Verkuilen (2002) it is the best available option, particularly if a long-run perspective is the main objective.</div>
<div>We also have to keep in mind that this <span class="il">measure</span> cannot capture everything that matters for a political regime. For example it makes sense to <span class="il">measure</span> corruption or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights/">human rights</a> separately from the <span class="il">democracy</span> concept. Not because it doesn't matter but because all aspects matter and for different question we want to be able to differentiate between the importance of different factors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Particularly good about the Polity IV measures is that the data source has a detailed explanation for each country why a country was classified in a particular way in a particular year: You find these country by country explanations in the pdf files <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/">here</a>.</div>
<h3>Comparison of different regime measures</h3>
This graph compares the political regime measures that are available for a very long time - since the early 19th century: the Polyarchy measure and the Polity measure and for a shorter period the the Freedom House measure. Shown is the share of democratic countries among all independent countries. There are some differences but the graphs shows they largely move together.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The global burden of disease is huge</h3>
How many healthy life years are lost due to diseases, deaths, and injuries? It is a daring question, but we actually do have a good answer to it. The <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">Global Burden of Disease</a> estimated that in 2012 2.8 billion healthy live years were lost to premature death or compromised by disability. This means that about 39% of potential human life and flourishing is not realized. The toll of communicable diseases alone ‚Äì which are easier to prevent ‚Äì is 13% of potential human life.[ref]Global DALYs: 38,779.9 per 100,000 in 2012 (all causes, both sexes) ‚Äì <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.DALYRATEWORLD?lang=en">Source</a>.
Global DALYs are 2,747,924,396 (all causes, both sexes) ‚Äì <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.DALYNUMWORLD?lang=en">Source</a>.
Global DALYs from Communicable &amp; other Group I are 13,083.6 per 100,000 (all causes, both sexes) ‚Äì <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.DALYRATEWORLD?lang=en">Source</a>.

The visualisation below shows the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost per 100,000.

<h3>Communicable diseases are a high burden of disease in poor countries</h3>
The disease burden due to communicable diseases alone is shown in the following map. Communicable diseases are often curable and better public health can reduce the burden considerably yet many poor countries still suffer from the burden of these diseases.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/148" width="300" height="150"></iframe>


<h3>There is much cross-country heterogeneity in terms of conditions contributing towards the burden of disease</h3>

The following visualization ‚Äì produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) ‚Äì presents a breakdown of burden-of-disease estimates for selected countries. A dedicated <a href="http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/">IHME website</a> provides a fascinating interactive tool to explore all available data on burden of disease worldwide.

As the chart below shows, different conditions contribute differently to health outcomes depending on the specific country and gender. While in Angola there are clear challenges relating to HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea and malaria, in countries such as the US or Germany, the biggest challenges relate to cardiovascular and respiratory disease and cancer (the main cause of 'neoplasms').

It is hard to estimate the number of smallpox[ref]The Wikipedia entry on smallpox is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox">here</a> (warning: the pictures are graphic).[/ref] victims in the past. Hays (2005)[ref]J. N. Hays (2005) ‚Äì Epidemics and Pandemics: Their Impacts on Human History. ABC-Clio. On <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Google Books here</a>.[/ref] writes: "No reliable estimate of the disease‚Äôs complete eighteenth-century toll exists, but the deaths certainly numbered in the millions. According to one estimate smallpox was claiming 400,000 European lives a year by the end of the 18th century ‚Äì at a time when the population of the continent numbered less than 200 million."

In the last decade of the 18th century, life expectancy was 32 in France and 40.5 in Denmark (see the data by Floud, Fogel, Harris, and Hong (2011) and the <a title="Life Expectancy" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/"><em>Our World in Data</em> entry on life expectancy</a>). Assuming an average life expectancy of 35 means that of the 200 million people 5.7 million died per year. This means that smallpox was the <em><strong>cause of death of 7% of Europeans at that time</strong></em>.

But the history of smallpox is obviously much longer ‚Äì Pharaoh Ramses V. might be the oldest known victim.[ref]Discussed in Donald R. Hopkins' book <em>The Greatest Killer: Smallpox in History</em>, at Google Books <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z2zMKsc1Sn0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=smallpox+ramses+v+donald+hopkins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-eZhtMvvlY&amp;sig=_U8BD7luZjIGH0YPVV_YiYaQnrI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMIyvHrqP7fxwIVSVYaCh02AQkg#v=onepage&amp;q=smallpox%20ramses%20v%20donald%20hopkins&amp;f=false">here</a>.¬†[/ref]

Today smallpox is a disease of the past. "The last known natural case was in Somalia in 1977. Since then, the only known cases were caused by a laboratory accident in 1978 in Birmingham, England, which killed one person and caused a limited outbreak. Smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1979."[ref]The source for this is the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/">smallpox information World Health Organization here</a>.

The following map shows when smallpox was eradicated from each country. Parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Brazil were the last places to have smallpox eradicated. But smallpox was eradicated from other parts of the world, especially Europe, far earlier, which suggests that slow eradication in some parts of the world was due primarily to weaker control systems¬†and ineffective vaccination strategies.

<h6>Year in which smallpox ceased to be endemic in each country ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
I have taken the data from a series of maps in chapter 8 in F. Fenner, D. A. Henderson, I. Arita, Z. Jezek, I. D. Ladnyi (1988) ‚Äì <em>Smallpox and its Eradication</em>. World Health Organization (WHO) 1988. The book is online <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf">here at the WHO website</a>.

The only data not taken from the maps but from the text are the data for Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand: For Canada the authors reported that ‚Äúendemic smallpox was eliminated by 1944‚Äù, for the USA only that it was eliminated ‚Äúthe latter half of the 1940s‚Äù (I chose 1948 for the visualization). Dates for the last outbreaks of smallpox in Australia (1917) and New Zealand (1914) are reported in the text ‚Äì in both countries smallpox has always been rare.
The dates for Madagascar and Namibia are not exactly known ‚Äì the authors only report that smallpox was eradicated in Madagascar before 1918 and for Namibia before 1955 (so I chose these years for eradication).
Countries are shown in their current borders ‚Äì successor countries of Yugoslavia, the USSR and the Sudan are assigned the eradication date of these states: 1925 for Yugoslavia, 1936 for the USSR, and 1972 for the Sudan.[/ref]

<h3>Rinderpest</h3>
Rinderpest[ref]Information on the eradication of Rinderpest can be found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest#Eradication">Wikipedia</a> and on <a href="http://en.wikivet.net/Rinderpest">Wikivet</a>.[/ref], also known as cattle plague, is the first animal disease that was ever eradicated. It was a disease primarily of cattle and buffalo that resulted in fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, other awful symptoms, and eventually death. Death rates during rinderpest outbreaks were remarkably high.

The FAO's Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP)¬†worked for decades to eliminate¬†the disease, which was declared eradicated in 2011[ref]World Organisation for Animal Health announcement, May 25, 2011, online <a href="http://www.oie.int/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/no-more-deaths-from-rinderpest/">here</a>.[/ref].

<h3>Polio</h3>
Poliomyelitis ‚Äì also called polio or infantile paralysis ‚Äì has been eliminated from many parts of the world and will hopefully be eradicated globally in the near future. Polio sometimes causes muscle weakness, most commonly in the legs, that can last over a few hours or days. Many people are able to fully recover, but not all. Some cases of polio result in temporary or permanent paralysis or other disability. Years later recovery, people may have post-polio syndrome where they see a resurgence of the muscle weakness during the initial infection. Polio is spread via infected feces[ref]See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis">Wikipedia page on polio</a>.[/ref]. The reduction in polio cases was made possible by polio vaccines developed in the 1950s. The following map shows the dramatic progress made in eliminating polio because of these vaccines.

<h3>Guinea Worm Disease</h3>
Guinea worm disease is caused by the largest tissue parasite affecting humans, called the guinea worm. The adult female can be 600-800mm in length. The parasite navigates through the host's tissue causing severe pain and eventually emerges, usually from the feet. The disease is rarely fatal, but infected people can be sick for months. It is transmitted via contaminated water.[ref]Information on guinea worm disease ‚Äì dracunculiasis ‚Äì can be found <a href="http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis/disease/en/">here at the WHO website</a>.[/ref] Fortunately, as we can see from the following chart, the number of guinea worm cases worldwide has decreased dramatically from the late 80s.

<h4>Deaths Due to Malaria</h4>
The WHO publishes global estimates of the number of people that die from malaria since 2000. Over the 15 year period the number of malaria deaths has been steadily decreasing globally: From 839,000 deaths in 2000 to 438,000 in 2015. Africa is the world region with the most deaths caused by malaria: 9 out of 10 malaria victims are from Africa in 2015. And change in Africa is also responsible for the majority of the decrease over the 15-year period. In 2000 764,000 Africans were killed by Malaria. Until 2015 the number of deaths declined to 395,000 per year.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
There is often confusion about what "eradication" means. Eradication is the "permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts." Eradication means that intervention measures are no longer required. "Elimination" refers to the "reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographic area as a result of deliberate efforts." A disease can be eliminated from a specific place without being eradicated. Actions to prevent the disease from transmitting or reemerging are still required once a disease is eliminated.

<h3>Famines over the Long Run</h3>
<h4>Global View</h4>
<p>Wikipedia presents a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines">list of famines</a> that covers more than 2 millenia.</p>
<h4>Single Countries</h4>
<p>Saito (2010) has created a chronology of famines in Japan since the 6th century. Before the 14th century data is judged to be incomplete (although the records for the 8th and 9th are surprisingly complete ‚Äì there were more than 35 famines in each of the two centuries. Overall Saito's chronology comprises information on 281 famines. None of these 281 famines happened in the 20th century but the following graph shows that the end of hunger in Japan arrived gradually. Before 1550 there were more than 10 famines per 50 years ‚Äì since then famines became less and less common in Japan.</p>

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Definition of Famine</h3>
<p>According to Cormac √ì Gr√°da[ref]Cormac √ì Gr√°da (2009) ‚Äì Famine: A Short History. Princeton University Press. The book's website is <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8857.html">here</a>.[/ref] famine refers to 'a shortage of food or purchasing power that leads directly to excess mortality from starvation or hunger-induced diseases'. It is not always straightforward to distinguish it from malnutrition that is described in a <a title="Hunger and Undernourishment" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/hunger-and-undernourishment/">different entry in this website</a>. The distinguishing feature between malnutrition and a famine is the latter's crisis character.<br />
Generally a famine is more severe than malnutrition ‚Äì √ì Gr√°da is more specific in this respect and according to him a famine is characterised by 3 features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 'daily death rate above 1 per 10.000 population',</li>
<li>The 'proportion of "wasted" children [that is, children weighing two standard deviations or more below the average] above 20 percent'[ref]Wasting is sometimes referred to as "acute malnutrition". <a href="http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_115.htm">The 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine' explains it <em>here</em></a>: 'wasting results from an acute shortage of food, is reversible with refeeding, and has a relatively high mortality rate'. This is different from stunting which is a chronic symptom of persistent malnutrition and less associated with food crises.[/ref]</li>
<li>'Prevalence of kwashiorkor' (extreme form of malnutrition mainly affecting young children).[ref]Kwashiorkor is explained <a href="http://conflict.lshtm.ac.uk/page_116.htm">here at the open-access educational resources for policy-makers provided by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a>.[/ref]</li>
</ol>
<p>According to O Grada a 'severe famine' means</p>
<ol>
<li>A daily death rate of above 5 / 10.000,</li>
<li>A proportion of wasted children above 40 percent, and</li>
<li>Again, the prevalence of kwashiorkor.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Comparability Across Time</h3>
<p>In the study of famines of the past historical myopia is a severe problem.¬†Loveday, an early researcher of Indian famines, noted in 1914, "The frequency of the mention of famine in the later history . . . increases in exact proportion with the precision and accuracy in detail of her historians."[ref]Loveday (1914) page 10 as cited in √ì Gr√°da ‚Äì (2007).</p>

In most countries basic education is nowadays perceived not only as a right, but also as a duty ‚Äì governments are typically expected to ensure access to basic education, while citizens are often required by law to attain education up to a certain basic level.[ref] See the Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education">compulsory education</a> for a table of the ages of compulsory schooling around the world.[/ref] This was not always the case: the advancement of these ideas began in the mid 19th century, when most of today‚Äôs industrialized countries started expanding primary education, mainly through public finances and government intervention. Data from this early period shows that government funds to finance the expansion of education came from a number of different sources, but specifically taxes at the local level played a crucial role. The historical role of local funding for public schools is important to help us understand changes ‚Äì or persistence‚Äì in regional inequalities.

The second half of the 20th century marked the beginning of education expansion as a global phenomenon. Available data shows that by 1990 government spending on education as a share of national income in many developing countries was already close to the average observed in developed countries.[ref]As per estimates from Adam Szirmai, (2015) The Dynamics of Socio-Economic Development, <a href="http://www.dynamicsofdevelopment.com">www.dynamicsofdevelopment.com</a>[/ref] This global education expansion in the 20th century resulted in a historical reduction in education inequality across the globe: in the period 1960-2010 education inequality went down every year, for all age groups and in all world regions. Recent estimates of education inequality across age groups suggest that further reductions in schooling inequality are still to be expected within developing countries.[ref]As per estimates of Gini coefficients for the distribution of school years in Crespo Cuaresma, J., KC, S., &amp; Sauer, P. (2013). Age-specific education inequality, education mobility and income growth (No. 6). WWWforEurope. Available online from <a href="http://www.ecineq.org/ecineq_bari13/FILESxBari13/CR2/p100.pdf">www.ecineq.org</a>[/ref]

Recent cross-country data from UNESCO tells us that the world is expanding government funding for education today, and these additional public funds for education are not necessarily at the expense of other government sectors. Yet behind these broad global trends there is substantial cross-country ‚Äì¬†and cross-regional ‚Äì heterogeneity. In high-income countries, for instance, households shoulder a larger share of education expenditures at higher education levels than at lower levels ‚Äì but in low-income countries this is not the case. Malawi is a stark example: tertiary education is almost completely subsidised by the state, yet household contribute almost 20% of the costs of primary education.

Following the agreement of the Millennium Development Goals, the first decade of the 21st century saw an important increase in international financial flows under the umbrella of development assistance. Recent estimates show that development assistance for education has stopped growing since 2010, with notable aggregate reductions on flows going to primary education. These changes in the priorization of development assistance for education across levels and regions, can have potentially large distributional effects, particularly within low income countries that depend substantially on this source of funding for basic education.[ref]As per estimates reported in Steer L. and K. Smith (2015), Financing education: Opportunities for global action. Center for Universal Education. Available Online from the Brookings Institution[/ref]

When analysing correlates, determinants and consequences of education consumption, the macro data indicates that national expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes. This is indicative of a complex 'education production function' whereby for any given level of expenditure, output achieved depends crucially on the input mix.

Available evidence specifically on the importance of school inputs to produce education, suggests that learning outcomes may be more sensitive to improvements in the quality of teachers, than to improvements in class sizes. Regarding household inputs, the recent experimental evidence suggests that interventions that increase the benefits of attending school (e.g. conditional cash transfers) are particularly likely to increase student time in school; and that those that incentivise academic effort (e.g. scholarships) are likely to improve learning outcomes.

Policy experiments have also shown that pre-school investment in demand-side inputs leads to large positive impacts on education ‚Äì and other important outcomes later in life. The environment that children are exposed to early in life, plays a crucial role in shaping their abilities, behavior and talents.

<h3>Historical perspective</h3>
<h4>When did the provision of education first become a public policy priority?</h4>
Governments around the world are nowadays widely perceived to be responsible for ensuring the provision of accessible quality education. This is a recent social achievement. The advancement of the idea to provide education for more and more children only began in the mid 19th century, when most of today‚Äôs industrialized countries started expanding primary education. The following visualization, plotting public expenditure on education as a share of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">Gross Domestic Product </a>(GDP) for a number of early-industrialized countries, shows that this expansion took place mainly through public funding.[ref]The source for the visualization below ‚Äì Tanzi &amp; Schuktnecht (2000) ‚Äì compiles estimates from many sources, including: League of Nations Statistical Yearbook (various years), Mitchell (1962), OECD Education at a Glance (1996), UNESCO World Education Report (1993), UNDP Human Development Report (1996), UN World Economics Survey (various years). To the extent that the authors do not specify which sources were prioritised for each year/country, it is not possible for us to reliably extend the time series with newer data. For instance, the OECD Education at a Glance report (1998), which presents estimates for the years 1990 and 1995, suggests discrepancies with the values reported by Tanzi &amp; Schuktnecht (2000) for 1993.[/ref] Our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/primary-education-and-schools/">Primary Education and Schools</a> provides details regarding how this expansion in funding materialized in better education outcomes for these countries.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public-education-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>How did the US finance the expansion of public education?</h4>
Public schools in the US currently educate more than 90% of all children enrolled in elementary and secondary schools.[ref]As per <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_105.20.asp">2015 enrolment estimates from the NCES.</a>[/ref] This is the result of a process of education expansion that relied heavily on public funding, particularly from local governments. The visualization below shows the sources of revenues for public schools in the US over the last 120 years. As it can be seen, states and localities are ‚Äì and have always been ‚Äì the main sources of funding for public primary education in the US. In fact, we observe three broad periods in this graph: there is first a period of stable revenues until 1920, then a period of sharp growth and decline during the interwar years, and then a period of substantial growth since the second world war, slowing down in the 1970s. In all these periods, federal funding was always very small, as can be seen when changing the visualisation from 'absolute' to 'relative'. Disaggregated data from the last couple of decades gives further insights into the specific sources of local revenues for schools in the US: the largest part comes from property taxes (about 80% of local revenues came from property taxes in 2013), while only a very small part comes from fees and donations (private funding for public schools, which is considered a local revenue, amounted to less than 2% of total public school revenues in 2013). This heavily decentralised system relying on property taxes has the potential of creating large inequalities in education, since public schools in affluent urban areas are able to raise more funding from local revenues. Indeed, a significant part of the debate on education inequalities in the US today focuses on the importance of increasing progressive federal spending to reduce inequalities in public school funding.[ref]A <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/13/arne-duncan-school-funding-disparities_n_6864866.html">recent article from the Huffington Post</a> highlights this point, including interesting visualizations documenting the important role that federal funding plays in reducing expenditure inequalities.[/ref]

<h4>How did France finance the expansion of public education?</h4>
The case of the US above shows that funding for public schools has been historically a responsibility of local governments. In other countries, such as France, the expansion of public education also took place initially with resources from local governments, but relatively quickly the fiscal burden was shifted to the national level. In France this transition was associated with a sharp jump towards universal access and a concomitant reduction in regional inequalities. The following visualization from Lindert (2004)[ref]Lindert, Peter H. <em>Growing public: Volume 1, the story: Social spending and economic growth since the eighteenth century</em>. Vol. 1. Cambridge University Press, 2004.[/ref] provides evidence of the French experience. As we can see there are three distinct periods: education spending was initially low and mainly private, then in 1833 funding began growing with local resources after the introduction of a law liberating communes to raise more local taxes for schools, and finally in 1881 the national government took over most of the financial responsibility after the introduction of a new law that abolished all fees and tuition charges in public elementary schools. In the source book, Lindert (2004) provides further evidence of how this transition towards centrally funded public education reduced north-south inequalities in France.

<h4>In the US growth in education expenditure was characterized by growth specifically in the public sector</h4>
A comparison of expenditure between public and private education institutions is helpful to contextualize the role that the public sector played in the process of education expansion in industrialized countries. The following graph does this using data from the National Center for Education Statistics in the US. It shows that during the years 1950-1970 ‚Äì a period of substantial growth in education expenditure in the US ‚Äì expenditure grew <em>specifically</em> in the public sector.[ref]Bear in mind that the estimates from the National Center for Education Statistics are not broken down by source of funds. Rather, they show expenditure by type of institution ‚Äì which is not equivalent, since public institutions may spend private resources, and vice versa.[/ref]

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/us-education-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp-public-and-private" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>When did the expansion of basic education become a global phenomenon?</h4>
The second half of the 20th century marked the beginning of education expansion as a global phenomenon. The visualization below, using data from Szirmai (2005)[ref] Szirmai, A. (2005) The Dynamics of Socio-Economic Development: An Introduction. Cambridge University Press. [/ref], shows government expenditure on education as a share of national income for a selection of low and middle-income countries, together with the corresponding average for high-income countries, for the period 1960-2010. As it can be seen, by 1990 government spending on education in many developing countries was already close to the average observed in developed countries.

It is important to point out that the remark above makes reference to convergence in expenditure relative to <em>income</em>. To the extent that low-income countries remain poorer than high-income countries, gaps in levels of expenditure per pupil are persistently large. Indeed, cross-country heterogeneity in education expenditure per pupil is currently much higher than heterogeneity in expenditure as share of GDP.[ref]In 2010, high income countries spent 6721 US PPP dollars per primary school pupil. Low income countries, in contrast, spent 115 US PPP dollars per pupil (UNESCO EFA Global Monitoring Report 2014). [/ref] One factor contributing to the slower convergence of expenditure per pupil in real terms is the fact that teachers' salaries ‚Äì <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#where-does-funding-for-education-go-to">the main component of education expenditure</a> ‚Äì are much higher in high-income countries, because labour has a higher opportunity cost in these countries. In general, the opportunity cost of labour is a key variable that governments in developing countries should factor in when deciding whether to expand education now, rather than later.

<h4>Education inequality is falling around the world</h4>
An important consequence of the global education expansion is a reduction in education inequality across the globe. The following visualization shows this through a series of graphs plotting changes in the Gini coefficient of the distribution of years of schooling across different world regions. The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality and higher values indicate higher inequality ‚Äì you can read about the definition and estimation of Gini coefficients in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">income inequality</a>. The time-series chart below shows inequality by age group. It can be seen that as inequality is falling over time, the level of inequality is higher for older generations than it is for younger generations. We can also see that in the reference period education inequality went down every year, for all age groups and in all world regions.

Have gains from historical education expansion fully materialized? The breakdown by age gives us a view into the future: as the inequality is lower among today's younger generations, we can expect the decline of inequality to continue in the future. Thus, further reductions in education inequality are still to be expected within developing countries; and if the expansion of global education can be continued, we can speed up this important process of global convergence.

<h4>Education inequality can decline rapidly across all levels of education ‚Äì South Korea is an example</h4>
The experience of South Korea shows that it is possible to reduce education inequality rapidly across all levels of education. The following visualization show two graphs comparing the concentration of years of education in South Korean between the years 1970 and 2010. To be precise, each of these graphs shows an education Lorenz curve: a plot showing the cumulative percentage of the schooling years across all levels of education on the vertical axis, and the cumulative percentage of the population on the horizontal axis. As it can be seen, in 2010 education was much less concentrated than in 1970, not only because there was a smaller share of individuals without schooling (shown along the bottom of the chart), but also because there was a smaller share of individuals concentrating large proportions of school-years at higher levels of education. Indeed, in only 40 years South Korea was able to double the mean years of schooling (from 6 to 12 years) and at the same time get remarkably close to the 45-degree line marking the hypothetical scenario of perfect equality of schooling. In other entries we show that in this same period South Korea increased drastically its <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-growth-over-the-last-centuries/#real-gdp-per-capita-around-the-world-ppp-adjusted-since-1000-max-roserref"> GDP per capita</a> while significantly improving health outcomes, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality?country=KOR">child mortality</a>.

<h3>Financing of Education Around the World Today</h3>
<h4>The world is expanding funding for education today</h4>
The last two decades have seen a small but general increase in the share of income that countries devote to education. The following chart plots trends in public expenditure on education as a share of GDP. As usual, a selection of countries is shown by default, but other countries can be added by clicking on the relevant option at the top of the chart. Although the data is highly irregular due to missing observations for many countries ‚Äì an issue we discuss in more detail in our section on Data Quality below ‚Äì, we can still observe a broad upward trend for the majority of countries. Specifically, it can be checked that of the 88 countries with available data for 2000/2010, three-fourths increased education spending as a share of GDP within this decade. As incomes ‚Äì measured by GDP per capita ‚Äì are generally increasing around the world, this means that the total amount of global resources spent on education is also increasing in absolute terms.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-government-expenditure-on-education-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Is additional funding for education taking resources from other sectors?</h4>
The above-mentioned growth in overall government expenditure on education as a share of GDP cannot be entirely attributed to a wide-spread change in the prioritization of education spending within domestic budgets. The following visualization shows government expenditure on education as a share of total government expenditure. In this case the available data does not suggest a discernible global pattern. For instance, of the 82 countries with available data for 2000 to 2010, only half increased spending on education relative to the other sectors. The data does suggest, however, that there is large and persistent cross-country heterogeneity in the relative importance of education vis-a-vis other sectors, even within developing countries. For example, in 2010 education accounted for about 8% of government spending in the Central African Republic, while it accounted for about 21% in Ghana.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-education-in-government-expenditure" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>European countries tend to assign a lower share of public budgets to education, relative to the amount of their income that is devoted to education</h4>
Generally speaking, countries that spend a large share of their income on education also tend to prioritize education highly within their budgets. The following visualization presents a snapshot of government spending on education around the world for the year 2010. Specifically, this graph plots government expenditure on education as a share of GDP in the vertical axis, and government expenditure on education as a share of total government expenditure in the horizontal axis. Each dot on this chart represents a different country, with the assigned colors denoting different world regions. As we can see, there is a positive correlation, but regional differences are stark: for almost every level of spending as a share of GDP along the horizontal axis, European countries (marked in light orange) spend a smaller budget share on education.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-edu-spending-gdp-vs-share-edu-total-spending" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>In European countries the weight of primary education within total education spending is lower than in other countries</h4>
In comparison to countries where education started expanding later, European countries tend to assign relatively more of their government education budgets to the secondary and tertiary levels, while at the same time devoting relatively less of their general government budgets to education as a whole. This can be appreciated in the following visualization, where the priorization of primary education (i.e. the share of primary education within the education budget) is plotted against the overall priorization of education (i.e. the share of education within the entire government budget). It can be seen that European countries (marked again in light orange) are mostly located in the bottom-left. And there is a weak positive correlation between the variables, both across all countries and across European countries.[ref]For reference, the correlation for all countries in this scatter plot is 0.24.[/ref]

<h4>In high-income countries households shoulder a larger share of education expenditures at higher education levels than at lower levels ‚Äì but in low-income countries this is not the case</h4>
The following visualization shows the percentage of total education expenditures contributed directly by households in 15 high income countries and 15 low/middle income countries (most recent data available on 2014). The top chart in this figure, corresponding to high income countries, shows a very clear pattern: households contribute the largest share of expenses in tertiary education, and the smallest share in primary education. Roughly speaking, this pattern tends to be progressive, since students from wealthier households are more likely to attend tertiary education, and those individuals who attend tertiary education are likely to perceive large private benefits (more on this in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/skill-premium-income-by-education/">Skill Premium</a>).[ref]Strictly speaking, for this spending pattern to be truly progressive there must be subsidies or income-contingent loans to guarantee that low-income students can also access tertiary education and reap the private benefits from this type of investment.[/ref] In contrast, the bottom chart shows a very different picture: in several low-income countries households contribute proportionally more to primary education than to higher levels. Malawi is a notable case in point ‚Äì tertiary education is almost completely subsidised by the state, yet household contribute with almost 20% of the costs in primary education. Such distribution of private household contributions to education is regressive.

<!--------------Recent developments (ii) OECD-------------->
<h3>The Recent Experience of OECD Countries</h3>
<h4>Primary education continues to be publicly funded in industrialized countries</h4>
We have already mentioned that those countries that pioneered the expansion of primary education in the 19th century ‚Äì all of which are current OECD member states ‚Äì relied heavily on public funding to do so. Today, public resources still dominate funding for the primary, secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education levels in these countries. While in the last decade the share of public funding for these levels of education has decreased slightly, the broad pattern is remarkably stable. The visualization below presents OECD-average expenditure on education institutions by source of funds.[ref]The OECD provides country-specific figures. However, there is relatively little variation across OECD countries in this respect. This is explained by near-universal enrolment rates at these levels of education and the demographic structure of the population.[/ref] By clicking on the option labeled 'relative' you can see the corresponding share of each source: private funding went up from 7.9% in 2000, to 9.4% in 2012. The role of public funding for other levels of education is however quite different. At the tertiary level public sources account for less than 70% of funding on average (2012 figures). Below we provide evidence of the pre-school level.

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-oecd-education-expenditure-by-source-of-funding-gdp" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<h4>Publicly funded pre-primary education is more strongly developed in the European countries of the OECD</h4>
High-income countries tend to have better developed pre-primary education systems than lower-income countries. However, within high-income countries there is substantial heterogeneity in the extent to which pre-primary education is publicly financed. The visualization below presents expenditure on pre-primary educational institutions as a share of GDP across the OECD. As it can be seen, publicly funded pre-primary education tends to be more strongly developed in the European than the non-European countries of the OECD. In fact, the OECD reports that in Europe the concept of universal access to education for 3-6 year-olds is generally accepted: most countries in this region provide all children with at least two years of free, publicly funded pre-primary education in schools before they begin primary education. The section below on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#correlates-determinants-and-consequences">Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</a> discusses the importance of early childhood interventions specifically in the context of education.

<h4>Where does funding for education go to?</h4>
The largest part of funding devoted to education in OECD countries goes to finance current expenditures, mainly compensation of staff ‚Äì specifically, teachers. The following two charts, taken from the OECD's report <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a>, highlight the labour-intensive nature of education. In the lower levels of education (i.e. primary, secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary) the share of current expenditure is very large and exhibits little cross-country variation ‚Äì between 90 and 97 percent of total expenditure corresponds to current expenditure across all of the OECD countries. In higher levels of education (i.e. tertiary) there is more cross-country variation, but current expenditure still dominates by a large margin across all countries.
<h6>Distribution of current and capital expenditure on educational institutions ‚Äì Figure B6.2 in <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a></h6>

<h4>What drives current expenditure on education?</h4>
In the figures above we noted the importance of current expenditure in the production of education. The following table provides further details regarding the type of expenditures that comprise current spending. Specifically, this chart shows a breakdown of expenditure for tertiary-level institutions in the US (public and private), during the period 1980-1997. It shows that instruction accounts for almost half of expenditure; and while there are some small differences across sectors, there is a fair amount of stability in expenditures across time. This serves as a benchmark for lower education levels, where instruction takes an even larger share of expenditure.[ref]This is a stylized fact of OECD education spending. In all the OECD countries, the share of spending devoted to compensation of teachers is by far the largest component of current expenditure. Moreover, expenditure on teachers' compensation is larger at the combined primary, secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary levels of education than at the tertiary level. See Table B6.2 in <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a> for details on the breakdown of current expenditure across all OECD countries by education level.

<!--------------Recent developments (iii) International Aid-------------->
<h3>International financing flows in the 21st Century</h3>
<h4>Education financing in developing countries has been largely affected by development assistance</h4>
Following the agreement of the Millennium Development Goals, the first decade of the 21st century saw an important increase in international financial flows under the umbrella of development assistance (often also called development aid, or simply 'aid'). The following chart shows total OECD development assistance flows for education by level, in constant 2013 US dollars, for the period 2002-2013. As it can be seen, there are two distinct periods: in 2003-2010 flows for education increased substantially, more than doubling in real terms across all levels of education; and in the years 2010-2013 funding for basic education <em>decreased</em>, while funding for secondary and post-secondary education remained relatively constant. For many low income countries, where development assistance contributes a substantial share of funding for education, this marked change in trends is important. As a reference, in 2012 development assistance accounted for more than 20 percent of all domestic spending on basic education in recipient low-income countries.[ref]Steer L. and K. Smith (2015), Financing education: Opportunities for global action. Center for Universal Education. Available Online from the Brookings Institution[/ref]

<h4>The share of development assistance for education going to Sub-saharan Africa has decreased</h4>
The recent reductions in development assistance funds for primary education have been coupled with important changes in regional priorities. Specifically, the share of development assistance for primary education going to sub-Saharan Africa has been decreasing sharply since the agreement of the Millennium Development Goals. The following chart shows this: sub-Saharan Africa‚Äôs share in total aid to primary education declined from 52 percent in 2002 to 30 percent in 2013, while the continent‚Äôs share in the total number of out-of-school children rose from 46 percent to 57 percent. This pattern is something specific to the education sector within the broader development assistance landscape: in the healthcare sector the overall slowdown of flows started a couple of years later, was less abrupt, and affected proportionally less the sub-Saharan countries.[ref]The share of development assistance going to sub-Saharan Africa has decreased as a whole ‚Äì from 55 percent in 2002 to 40 percent in 2013 ‚Äì, but as we note the drop specifically for primary education has been steeper.[/ref] Indeed, recent studies further highlight that development assistance for education is significantly different to assistance for healthcare in other ways: the education sector attracts less earmarked funding through multilaterals, and includes a smaller proportion of resources that developing governments can directly control for programming.[ref]Steer L. and K. Smith (2015), Financing education: Opportunities for global action. Center for Universal Education.

<h4>Development assistance priorities have a scope for increasing or reducing expenditure inequalities</h4>
In the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#historical-perspective.">Historical Perspective</a> section above, we mentioned that public spending on education has translated, in the long run, into lower inequality in education outcomes across most of the world. But for any given country, with a determined income distribution and demographic structure, the extent to which public spending on education contributes to reduce inequality depends crucially on the way in which spending is focused across education levels. The recent UNICEF report <a href="http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Investment_Case_for_Education_and_Equity_FINAL.pdf">The Investment Case for Education and Equity</a> shows that in low income countries, on average 46 percent of public resources are allocated to the 10 percent of students who are most educated ‚Äì while this figure goes down to 26 and 13 percent in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries respectively. The following visualization shows further details on the concentration of public spending across different countries. The vertical axis shows the percentage of public education resources going to the 10% most educated or 10% least educated students ‚Äì as we can see expenditure is heavily concentrated at the top in many low income countries.

The earlier remarks about trends in international education financing flows (namely that aid is very important in low-income countries, and that a relatively low and shrinking share of aid is going to primary levels), suggest that inequality in public spending will worsen in low income countries. Yet development assistance priorities have a scope for changing this.[ref]The conclusion from these figures is that, while public spending does reduce education inequality in low income countries, remaining inequalities could be further reduced by shifting resources towards lower levels of education. This evidently does not mean that resources <em>should</em> be shifted ‚Äì low income countries and aid donors may have other objectives apart from reducing inequality. But the case for reducing inequality at the bottom is very strong, and some studies suggest that returns to education at the primary level might be higher than at post-primary levels in low income countries (for a discussion of the vast literature on returns to education, and the ongoing debate on the validity of estimates, see Heckman, J. J., Lochner, L. J., &amp; Todd, P. E. (2006). Earnings functions, rates of return and treatment effects: The Mincer equation and beyond. Handbook of the Economics of Education, 1, 307-458. ).[/ref]

<!------------------------CORRELATES---------------------->
<h2>Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</h2>
<h3>The big picture</h3>
<h4>Why do governments finance education?</h4>
One of the reasons to justify government intervention in the market for education, is that education generates positive externalities.[ref]That positive externalities justify government intervention in the provision of education is essentially an efficiency argument. The logic is that individuals may not spend enough on education because they fail to internalize the positive effect that their education has on other people. But there are, of course, also equity arguments to justify government intervention in the provision of education ‚Äì for instance, reducing inequality in education may be of intrinsic value, or may be instrumental in reducing inequalities in other outcomes.[/ref] This essentially means that investing in education yields both private and social returns. Private returns to education include higher wages and better employment prospects (as we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/skill-premium-income-by-education/">Skill Premium</a>). Social return include pro-social behaviour (e.g. volunteering, political participation) and interpersonal <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trust/">trust</a>. The following chart uses OECD results from the Survey of Adult Skills to show how self-reported trust in others correlates with educational attainment. More precisely, this chart plots the percentage-point difference in the likelihood of reporting to trust others, by education level of respondents. Those individuals with upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education are taken as the reference group, so the percentage point difference is expressed in relation to this group. As we can see, in all countries those individuals with tertiary education were by far the group most likely to report trusting others. And in almost every country, those with post-secondary non-tertiary education were more likely to trust others than those with primary or lower secondary education. The OECD's report <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a> provides similar descriptive evidence for other social outcomes. The conclusion is that adults with higher qualifications are more likely to report desirable social outcomes, including good or excellent health, participation in volunteer activities, interpersonal trust, and political efficacy. And these results hold after controlling for literacy, gender, age and monthly earnings.
<h6>Likelihood of reporting to trust others, by educational attainment, OECD 2012 ‚Äì Figure A8.4 in <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1">Education at a Glance (2015)</a>[ref]As per the source notes: "Percentage-point difference reflects the relative change of reporting to trust others compared to the reference category. For example, in Norway, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education reporting to trust others increases by 20 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education. Similarly, after accounting for literacy proficiency, the percentage of individuals with tertiary education increases by 16 percentage points compared to someone who has upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education."[/ref]</h6>

<h4>Do countries that spend more public resources on education tend to have better education outcomes?</h4>
Education outcomes are typically measured via 'quantity' output (e.g. years of schooling) and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education">'quality' output</a> (e.g. learning outcomes, such as test scores from the Programme for International Student Assessment ‚Äì PISA). The following visualization presents three scatter plots using 2010 data to show the cross-country correlation between (i) education expenditure (as a share of GDP), (ii) mean years of schooling, and (iii) mean PISA test scores. At a cross-sectional level, expenditure on education correlates positively with both quantity and quality measures; and not surprisingly, the quality and quantity measures also correlate positively with each-other. But obviously correlation does not imply causation: there are many factors that simultaneously affect education spending and outcomes. Indeed, these scatterplots show that despite the broad positive correlation, there is substantial dispersion away from the trend line ‚Äì in other words, there is substantial variation in outcomes that does not seem to be captured by differences in expenditure. This motivates the question below.
<h6>Correlation between education outcomes and education expenditure (2010 data)[ref]Data on expenditure corresponds to 2010 total government education expenditure across all levels, as a share of GDP (source: World Bank Education Statistics). Data on PISA scores corresponds to 2010 mean average test scores across categories ‚Äì mathematics, reading and science (source: OECD PISA). Data on years of schooling corresponds to 2010 mean years of schooling for the population aged 15 and over (source: Barro Lee Education dataset)[/ref]</h6>

<h4>Does cross-country variation in government education expenditure explain cross-country differences in education outcomes?</h4>
The following visualization presents the relationship between PISA reading outcomes and average education spending per student, splitting the sample of countries by income levels. It shows that income is an important factor that affects both expenditure on education and education outcomes: we can see that above a certain national income level, the relationship between PISA scores and education expenditure per pupil becomes virtually inexistent. Several studies with more sophisticated econometric models corroborate the fact that expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes.[ref]For a discussion of evidence supporting this claim, see Hanushek, E. A., (2006). School Resources. Handbook of the Economics of Education, 2.[/ref] You can read more about test scores and learning outcomes in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education-drop-out-rates/">Quality of Education</a>.

<h4>What inputs enter the 'education production function'?</h4>
The fact that expenditure on education does not explain well cross-country differences in learning outcomes is indicative of the intricate nature of the process through which such outcomes are produced. Borrowing the terms from the economics literature, the following ‚Äòproduction function‚Äô provides a conceptual framework to think about the determinants of learning outcomes:[ref]P. Glewwe, K. Muralidharan (2016). <em>Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications</em>. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 5.[/ref]

[latex]$$A=a(s,\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{C},\mathbf{H},\mathbf{I})$$[/latex]
where <em>A</em> is skills learned (achievement), <em>s</em> is years of schooling, <strong>Q</strong> is a vector of school and teacher characteristics (quality), <strong>C</strong> is a vector of child characteristics (including "innate ability"), <strong>H</strong> is a vector of household characteristics, and <strong>I</strong> is a vector of school inputs under the control of households, such as children‚Äôs daily attendance, effort in school and in doing homework, and purchases of school supplies.

This conceptualization highlights that, for any given level of expenditure, the output achieved will depend on the input mix. And consequently, this implies that in order to explain education outcomes, we must rely on information about specific inputs. In the following sections we explore evidence regarding the returns to household inputs (i.e. different elements of <strong>Q</strong>) and demand-side inputs (i.e. elements of <strong>C,H</strong> and <strong>I</strong>).
<h3>School inputs</h3>
<h4>Each education system is different, but improving teacher quality is often more effective to improve learning outcomes than increasing the number of teachers per pupil</h4>
A vast number of studies have tried to estimate the impact of classroom resources on learning outcomes. The following table summarizes results from the systematic review in Hanushek (2006)[ref]Hanushek, E. A., (2006). School Resources. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 2. Elsevier.[/ref]. In this table, the left-hand side summarizes results from econometric studies focusing on developing countries, while the right-hand side presents evidence from the US (where studies have concentrated extensively). We can see that for all listed inputs and across all countries, the share of studies that have found a positive effect is small ‚Äì in fact, the majority of studies find either no effect, or a negative effect. This clearly does not mean that these classroom resources are not important, but rather that it is very difficult to know with confidence when and where they are a binding constraint to improve learning outcomes. A first conclusion, therefore, seems to be that context and input mix are fundamental to improving outcomes ‚Äì even in developing countries where the expected returns to additional resources is large across the board.

Taking the ratio of positive to negative effects detected in the literature as a proxy for what tends to work best, we can derive a second conclusion from the table below: spending more resources on better teachers (i.e. improving teacher experience and teacher education) tends to work better to improve learning outcomes than simply increasing the number of teachers per pupil. And this seems to be true both in developed and developing countries. This last conclusion is consistent with the main message from the OECD's report <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisainfocus/49685503.pdf">Does money buy strong performance in PISA?</a>, which points out that countries that prioritised the quality of teachers over class sizes performed better in PISA tests.[ref] This claim is clearly only descriptive, since there are many underlying variables that simultaneously drive teacher characteristics and student outcomes in any particular country. Indeed, most of the available evidence on whether teacher quality and quantity matters is difficult to interpret causally, as it is hard to find instances where teacher quality / quantity varies exogenously. A recent study concludes on the topic: <em> "teachers vary in many ways, but we found no high-quality studies that have examined the impact of teacher characteristics on student learning or time in school" </em>(source: page 696, Glewwe, P. and Muralidharan, K. (2016) Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 5. ) [/ref] And it is also consistent with a recent high-quality study on the impact of teacher quality on test scores using data from the US, which suggests that improvements in teacher quality can causally raise students‚Äô test scores (evidence from Chetty et al. (2014)[ref]Chetty, Raj, John N. Friedman, and Jonah E. Rockoff. 2014. ‚ÄúMeasuring the Impacts of Teachers I: Evaluating Bias in Teacher Value-Added Estimates.‚Äù American Economic Review, 104(9): 2593-26[/ref] ‚Äì see our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/quality-of-education#teacher-quality">Quality of Education </a>for a discussion of their results).

<h4>Remedial teaching can yield substantial improvements in learning outcomes</h4>
Education in low-income countries is particularly difficult because there is substantial heterogeneity in the degree of preparation that children have when they enter school ‚Äì much more so than in high-income countries. Recent evidence from policy 'experiments' in developing countries suggests that remedial teaching, in the form of assistants teaching targeted lessons to the bottom of the class, can yield substantial improvements in learning outcomes. The following visualization summarizes the effects of four different policy treatments within the so-called Teacher Community Assistant Initiative (TCAI) in Ghana ‚Äì this is an initiative that evaluated four different such remedial teaching interventions.[ref]Further details in Innovations for Poverty Action, 2014. Implementation Lessons: The Teacher Community Assistant Initiative (TCAI). Available online from <a href="http://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/TCAI_Final%20Results_040115.pdf">www.poverty-action.org</a> [/ref] The units in this figure are standard deviations of test results. The first two sets of estimates correspond to the test-score impacts of enabling community assistants to provide remedial instruction specifically to low-performing children, either during school, ÔÇåor after school. The third set of estimates corresponds to test-score impacts of providing a community assistant and reducing class size, without targeting instruction to low-performing pupils. And the last set of results corresponds to testing the effect of training teachers to provide small-group instruction targeted at pupils‚Äô actual learning levels.

As we can see, while all interventions had a positive effect, the lowest impacts ‚Äì across all tests ‚Äì come from the non-targeted 'normal curriculum' intervention that reduced class sizes, and from the intervention that provided training to teachers on how to engage in targeted remedial teaching themselves. This suggests that the improvements in outcomes were caused by the combination of targeted instruction and TCAs who, unlike teachers, were specifically dedicated to this purpose. These results are consistent with findings from across Africa, suggesting that teaching at the right level causes better learning outcomes in a cost-effective way (see Glewwe and Muralidharan 2016[ref]Glewwe, P. and Muralidharan, K. (2016) Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 5. Elsevier.[/ref] for further details on this evidence).

<h4>Are pay-for-performance teacher contracts an effective instrument to improve learning outcomes?</h4>
We have already made the point that the bulk of education expenditure goes specifically towards financing teachers. And we have also pointed out that improving teacher quality may be a particularly good instrument to improve teaching outcomes. This leads to a natural question: are pay-for-performance teacher contracts an effective instrument to improve learning outcomes? A growing body of literature in the economics of education has started using randomized control trials (i.e. policy 'experiments') to answer this question. Glewwe and Muralidharan (2016)[ref]Glewwe, P. and Muralidharan, K. (2016) Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 5. Elsevier.[/ref] provide the following account of the available evidence:
<blockquote><em>"[R]esults suggest that even modest changes to compensation structures to reward teachers on the basis of objective measures of performance (such as attendance or increases in student test scores) can generate substantial improvements in learning outcomes at a fraction of the cost of a "business as usual" expansion in education spending. However, not all performance pay programs are likely to be effective, so it is quite important to design the bonus formulae well and to make sure that these designs reflect insights from economic theory."</em> [ref]Glewwe, P. and Muralidharan, K. (2016) Improving Education Outcomes in Developing Countries: Evidence, Knowledge Gaps, and Policy Implications. Handbook of the Economics of Education, Volume 5. Elsevier.[/ref]</blockquote>
The conclusion is that well-designed pay-for-performance contracts are a cost-effective instrument to boost test scores; but this does not mean that they are necessarily effective at achieving other ‚Äì perhaps equally important ‚Äì objectives of time spent in school. In simple words, it is possible that pay-for-performance yields 'teaching to the test'. Alternative incentive mechanisms, such as community-based monitoring of teachers, have been proposed as an alternative. Glewwe and Muralidharan (2016) also provide a review of the ‚Äì somewhat limited ‚Äì available evidence on such alternative incentive mechanisms.[ref]They conclude that "evidence on the impact of monitoring on time in school is scarce and not encouraging...[while] the evidence of the impact of monitoring on student learning is only somewhat more encouraging"[/ref]
<h3>Household inputs</h3>
<h4>School attendance and student effort are responsive to incentives</h4>
Demand-side inputs are as important as supply-side inputs to produce education. Attending school and exerting effort are perhaps the most obvious examples: without these inputs even the best endowed schools will fail to deliver good outcomes. The table below summarizes information on different demand-side investments that have shown to successfully improve quality and quantity outcomes. More precisely, this table gathers evidence from randomized control trials in developing countries, as per the review in Glewwe and Muralidharan (2016). The reported figures correspond to positive/negative significant/insignificant estimates across a set of available experimental studies (bear in mind some studies estimate more than one effect ‚Äì e.g. by measuring outcomes at several points in time). As we can see, the evidence suggests that interventions that increase the benefits of attending school ‚Äì such as conditional cash transfers ‚Äì are likely to increase student time in school. And those that increase the benefits of higher effort and better academic performance ‚Äì such as merit scholarships ‚Äì are likely to improve learning outcomes (see Glewwe and Muralidharan 2016 for further details on the underlying policy interventions, plus further evidence and discussion of results).

<h4>Targeting health problems can be a particularly cost-effective way of increasing school attendance</h4>
In many low-income countries, health problems are an important factor preventing children from attending school. The following visualization presents a comparison of the impact that a number of different health interventions have achieved in different countries ‚Äì together with some non-health-related interventions that serve as reference. The hight of each bar in this graph reflects the additional school years achieved per hundred dollars spent on the corresponding intervention; so these estimates can be interpreted as a measure of how cost-effective the different interventions are.[ref]Bear in mind that the reported gains in school years are a measure of the <em>total</em> impact of the program across the treated population, rather than impact per treated student. Further information on cost-effectiveness analysis is available from the source of the graph.[/ref] We see that treating children for intestinal worms (labeled 'deworming' in the chart) led to an additional 13.9 years of education for every $100 spent in Kenya; while a program targeting anaemia (labeled 'iron fortification') led to 2.7 additional years per $100 in India. These interventions seem to be much more cost-effective to improve test scores than conditional cash transfers, free school uniforms, or merit scholarships (further details on all interventions available from Dhaliwal et al. 2012[ref]Dhaliwal, I., Duflo, E., Glennerster, R., &amp; Tulloch, C. (2013). Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis to inform policy in developing countries: a general framework with applications for education. Education Policy in Developing Countries, 285-338.[/ref]). Of course, ranking these interventions is not trivial since most programmes achieve multiple outcomes ‚Äì indeed, we have already discussed that remedial teaching is generally effective to increase test-scores, although here we see a particular instance where it had no impact on school attendance. Nevertheless, health interventions seem to be particularly interesting, since they lead to substantial achievements in both education <em>and</em> health outcomes (for a recent analysis of the literature on the impacts of mass deworming see Croke et al. 2016[ref]Croke, Kevin, Joan Hamory Hicks, Eric Hsu, Michel Kremer, and Edward Miguel. 2016. ‚ÄúDoes Mass Deworming Affect Child Nutrition? Meta-analysis, Cost-effectiveness, and Statistical Power.‚Äù Working Paper.[/ref]).

<h4>How important are pre-school investments?</h4>
The environment that children are exposed to early in life, plays a crucial role in shaping their abilities, behavior and talents. To a great extent, this is what drives large and remarkably persistent gaps in the education achievement between individuals in the same country, but in different socioeconomic environments. Cunha et al. (2006) provide a detailed account of the theory and evidence behind this claim, and discuss its implications for the design of education policies. Below we provide a chart showing the impacts from the Perry Preschool Program ‚Äì a flagship experimental intervention study, designed to test the impact of pre-school education on subsequent education outcomes.[ref]More specifically, the Perry pre-school 'experiment' consisted in enrolling 65 randomly selected black children in a pre-school program, and comparing their outcomes later in life against those achieved by a control group of roughly the same size. The treatment consisted of a daily 2.5-hour classroom session on weekday mornings and a weekly 90-minute home visit by the teacher on weekday afternoons to involve the mother in the child's educational process. More information and details on the intervention are available in Cunha et al. (2006).[/ref] The chart shows that disadvantaged children participating in the pre-school program (the 'treatment group') had higher grades and were more likely to graduate from high school than the reference control group. Moreover, they spent substantially less time in special education. Other programs have similarly shown evidence of very large and persistent returns to early education interventions.

<!--------------DATA QUALITY-------------------------->
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Measurement</h2>
<h3>Relationship between sources</h3>
The main source of data on international education expenditure is UNESCO's Institute for Statistics <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Pages/default.aspx">(UIS)</a>. The¬†same data is also then published by the World Bank (<a href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/education/">World Bank EdStats</a> and <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a>) and <a href="https://www.gapminder.org">Gapminder</a>. It is also the main source of education data for most UN reports ‚Äì such as the EFA Global Monitoring Report (UNESCO), the Human Development Report (UNDP), the State of the World‚Äôs Children report (UNICEF) and the Millennium Development Goals (UN).

The UIS database is produced mainly from yearly national reports, but it also relies on reports from international organizations.[ref] The <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/Background_information_on_education_statistics.pdf">official documentation</a> says: "The UIS collects education statistics in aggregate form from official administrative sources at the national level. Collected information encompasses data on educational programmes, access, participation, progression, completion, literacy, educational attainment and human and financial resources. These statistics cover formal education in public (or state) and private institutions (pre-primary, primary, basic and secondary schools, and colleges, universities and other tertiary education institutions); and special needs education (both in regular and special schools)".[/ref] Specifically, countries in the European Union, or members of the OECD, have richer data, since they collect information through the UIS-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) survey, which is more detailed than the UIS survey (see more at <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/FAQ.aspx#sthash.hZOv7Ole.dpuf">FAQ-UIS</a>)

Another, related but different source of education expenditure data, is the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), which publishes the Statistics of Public Expenditure for Economic Development (SPEED). This source relies primarily on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
<h3>Definitions</h3>
In the UIS database, government expenditure on education includes spending by local/municipal, regional and national governments, on public and private educational institutions, education administration, and subsidies for private entities (students/households and other privates entities). This information is then reported by level of education, and typically as a share of national income (GDP) or as a share of total public expenditure. In principle, expenditure on pre-primary levels as well as expenditure sourced with transfers from international sources to government, are included. In practice, however, many countries under report these specific figures.
<h3>Measurement limitations</h3>
The UIS has been maintained since 1999 with the intent of providing comparable expenditure figures across countries and time, and its estimates rely on reports submitted by ministries and national statistics offices. Since reporting is delegated typically to ministries of education, in some instances data on total public expenditure on education fails to represent spending by other ministries that also have budgets for education. Additionally, since not all countries have (or update) national education accounts, the UIS attempts to generate estimates and impute missing data using information from national publications, official websites and other sources. However, the UIS dataset has several missing observations, particularly for years prior to 2010.

To gauge the extent to which UIS data is reliable, the following visualization shows the proportions of regular and irregular data that countries make available (where ‚ÄòRegular‚Äô means data is available at least once every 3 years; and ‚ÄòIrregular‚Äô means data is available less frequently than every 3 years). As it can be seen, the picture is not particularly encouraging: less than half of the countries reported regularly data on total government expenditure on education over the reference period.
<h6>Availability of education financing data in the UIS database, 2005-2013, as a percentage of all (214) countries ‚Äì Figure 1 in UNESCO‚ÄìUIS (2016)[ref]UNESCO‚ÄìUIS (2016). A roadmap to better data on education financing. <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/a-roadmap-to-better-data-on-education-financing.pdf">INFORMATION PAPER NO. 27</a>.[/ref]</h6>

Apart from the above-mentioned issues regarding availability of data, international cross-country comparisons of education financing estimates are also problematic due to lack of consistency in classification of expenditures, especially on the borderline of education services. While this is less problematic than in other sectors, such as healthcare, there are still some difficult cases ‚Äì such as classifying expenditure for teaching hospitals, or expenditure on ancillary services such as transportation. For a further discussion of these issues see the <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/UOE-data-collection-manual-formal-education-concepts-definitions-classifications-2015-en.pdf">UIS data collection manual </a>.

Over the course of the 21st century world population will likely only rise by 50% and reach around 11 billion by 2100. Peak world population growth rate was already reached in the late 1960s, and it has been falling since.

There are two primary determinants of population growth: life expectancy and fertility rates. The global improvement in life expectancy works to increase the world population, but it is more than offset by the fall in fertility. The global average fertility rate was 5 children per woman until the end of the 1960s and has halved since then. While the world population increased by 2% annually in the late 60s it has now slowed to an increase of just about 1%. From previous UN projections of population growth rates we have learned that the accuracy of the projections is very high.

<h3>The Two Drivers of World Population Growth: The World Fertility Rate &amp; The World Life Expectancy</h3>

Population growth is driven by two different factors: fertility and life expectancy.[ref]Fertility is measured as the children per woman, but¬†the measure is less self-explanatory than one might presume. It is explained at the UN website <a href="http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/fertility.htm">here</a>.[/ref]¬†It is important to have an idea of how the two drivers changed and how they are interlinked to understand how the forecasts are possible and to assess their credibility.

As the fertility rate measures the children per woman, a rate of 2 would mean that every woman gives birth to (on average) one girl. Therefore, the current generation of women would just replace itself by a younger generation of girls. The fertility rate that would create this scenario is called the replacement rate.¬†In reality the replacement rate is higher than 2 because not all girls reach the age to give birth. This means that the replacement rate for populations with low mortality is close to 2 and for populations with a high mortality is considerably over 2. As mortality differs widely between different nations, the replacement rate for different countries ranges from below 2.1 for rich countries to almost 3.5 for Sierra Leone according to a research paper by Espenshade, Guzman and Westoff (2003).[ref]Espenshade, Guzman, and Westoff (2003) - The Surprising Global Variation in Replacement Fertility. In Population Research and Policy Review, 22, 5-6, 575--583. The research estimates the replacement rates ¬†for the time 1995-2000.[/ref] Globally the study found a replacement rate of¬†2.335.

The population increases not only when more children are born but also when less people die. This makes¬†life expectancy the¬†second driver of population growth. Furthermore, the replacement rate is a function of life expectancy as increasing life expectancy means that more daughters reach the age to become mothers themselves.

Before we look at the forecast for the world population over the next century, we look at the two drivers of population growth: world total fertility rate and world life expectancy.
<h4>The World Fertility Rate</h4>
In the late 1960s the fertility rate in less developed regions of the world started falling. It is this important change that reduced the world fertility rate from almost 5 (in the 1950s and 60s) to around 2.5 children per woman in the present world. The UN forecasts that this downward trend will continue¬†and that over the course of this century the world total fertility rate will continue to fall from 2.5 to just over 2. As world fertility approaches¬†the replacement level, it ceases to be the driver behind world population growth in the near future.

The high population growth rates are a modern development. They were non-existent in the pre-modern world--but not for lack of trying. Previously birth rates were very high, but the horrific child mortality rates in the pre-modern world prevented the population from growing. This lack of population growth¬†implies that during this time period¬†the average family size was small.

With the onset of modernity, as living standards rose and health improved, more and more children survived, which led to unprecedented growth of the population. This episode of large families was short and only lasted for few generations. As a consequence of further development, the family size began¬†decreasing around the world -- this time not due to high child mortality, but due to low birth rates. How rapidly the world changed is hard to grasp, but a comparison highlights this transformation: In 1950, 44% of the world population had a total fertility of ¬†6 or more children. By 2010 the world has massively changed and 48% now have less than 2.1 children! This development of a decreasing family size around the world is depicted in the following graph.

Fertility is driven by the socio-economic development of the population, especially the status and wellbeing of women. Accordingly, the early developing populations started the transition much earlier than world regions that remained poor for a longer time. Europeans and Northern Americas reached the replacement rate at a time when fertility only started to decline in Asia and Latin America. Africa, where poverty and lack of education persisted even longer, was the last continent to experience a decreasing fertility rate.

<h3>Forecast of World Population Growth</h3>
The most discussed forecasts of the world population are those by the Population Division of the United Nations that are discussed here. But there are also other institutions working on population forecasts like the Austria-based Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) that can be found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131120010815/http://www.iiasa.ac.at:80/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/POP.en.html">here</a>. We can see below that there are stark differences in the projected world population depending on the fertility rate. If the rate is low, then the world population will start to decline. However, if it is high, then the population will continue to increase rapidly with no decrease in sight.

The following graph shows how this increase in world population is shared amongst different world regions. We can see that presently China, India and Africa are the regions that have the largest world population and are predicted to stay that way by 2100. But, if you click ‚Äòexpanded‚Äô and change the graph from absolute numbers to shares of world population, we can see that India and Africa‚Äôs share of world population is continued to increase, while China‚Äôs is expected to decrease, likely due to falling¬†<a title="Fertility Rates" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/fertility-rates/">fertility rates</a>.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
As shown above, changes in <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> and <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/fertility-rates/">fertility rates</a> determine population growth. The data entry on past <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/#correlates-determinants-consequences">world population growth</a> discusses the demographic transition as the central concept that explains population growth.
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
In a 2001 paper, Nico Keilman assed the forecasts of world population the UN published between 1951 and 1998.[ref]Keilman (2001) - Data quality and accuracy of United Nations population projections, 1950-95. In Population Studies, 55, 2, 149--164.[/ref] The next graph shows the estimates of the actual world population in retrospect along with the UN forecasts between 1950 and 1980. With one exception (1950 I) that can be explained by the low data quality - especially for the populous country of China - the forecasts are remarkably accurate. Even the 1950 III forecast that was made with better information on China after the 1953 Census is not far off for the population size half a century later.

Nevertheless the direction of the under- and overestimation of the world population is interesting and telling. Over the first four decades the UN forecasts underestimated world population growth and this reversed over the last 10 years when the world population size and growth rates were overestimated.¬†Why this happened becomes clearer if we look at the last two graphs - the true and forecasted world fertility rate and life expectancy.

This graph is taken from Keilman (2001) - Data quality and accuracy of United Nations population projections, 1950-95. In Population Studies, 55, 2, 149--164.[/ref]

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Population-Size-The-Estimates-of-the-Wold-Population-compared-with-the-UN-Forecasts-since-1950-Keilman-2001.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1414 size-full" title="" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Population-Size-The-Estimates-of-the-Wold-Population-compared-with-the-UN-Forecasts-since-1950-Keilman-2001.png" alt="World Population Size - The Estimates of the Wold Population compared with the UN Forecasts since 1950 - Keilman (2001)" width="642" height="501" /></a>

Keilman (2001) also studies the two drivers of population growth separately and this can help to explain why the UN first underestimated the population growth and then overestimated the population. As shown in the following two graphs he finds that the UN firstly underestimated the rapid fall of world fertility and that secondly the UN "projection makers have been too pessimistic about future mortality" and that "predicted life expectancy levels that were too low on average ‚Äì much too low in many cases".

On a regional level the study finds that 'Not surprisingly, problems are largest in pre-transition countries, and especially in Asia'. He highlights that the stagnation or even decline of life expectancy in the former USSR before its dissolution has not been unforseen and caused the forecasts to be inaccurate.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The UK vs the US</h3>
How very differently the benefits of economic growth can be shared is shown by a comparison of the USA and the UK over the last 40 years. In the US incomes for the bottom half of the population were stagnating for most of the last 4 decades (with a notable exception over the second half of the 1990s). In the UK the first period resembles the experience of the US ‚Äì incomes at the bottom of the distribution were stagnating, incomes at the top were rising rapidly. But over the second period ‚Äì from 1991 onwards ‚Äì the trend in the UK has changed significantly: economic growth was shared equally across the distribution from the lowest to the highest decile.

The comparison also show that growth in the UK ‚Äì particularly for the lowest income group ‚Äì was much stronger than in the US. A comparison with other rich countries shows that the experience of the US ‚Äì strongly rising inequality and stagnation for a large part of the population ‚Äì is unique to the US. Other rich countries were much more successful in sharing the benefits of growth across the distribution.

<h3>The UK ‚Äì increasing inequality in the 80s followed by strong growth for all households</h3>
The following interactive chart offers a more detailed look at the evolution of incomes in the UK.

Inequality has evolved differently in different countries; it is not one story that would be the same everywhere. Inequality is determined by the complex interactions of the tax system, government policy, education, growth cycle and many other factors.

The UK experienced a large increase in inequality during the 80s but has since stabilized. The early 80s saw a period of rising inequality caused by stagnation of the middle and lower income groups and growth at the higher end. Uneven growth in the years leading up to 1991 meant further rises in inequality.¬†Throughout the 90s and 00s, more even growth across the distribution has meant little change to¬†inequality. In comparison with other countries it is worth pointing out that income growth in the UK was remarkably strong in the two decades leading up to the crisis.

<h3>The US ‚Äì incomes for most households stagnate &amp; inequality increases constantly</h3>
Inequality in the US has increased dramatically over time. During the 80s, we can see that the living standards of the poorest half fell while they increased for the richest. Throughout the 90s there was a sustained period of improvement at all levels of society, but without any real reduction in inequality. From the year 2000 onwards we observe a period of stagnation for the lower income groups accompanied by increased inequality as the richest capture most of the gains from growth. In 2013, approximately 60% of the population were better off in than the year 2000.

<h3>Australia ‚Äì rising inequality but everyone is better off</h3>
Australia has also seen an increase in inequality, but in contrast to the US, the incomes of all households increased substantially. This contrast is a good example that makes clear that we cannot rely on aggregate measures ‚Äì like mean GDP growth and inequality measures ‚Äì alone. We have to study incomes across the entire distribution to be able to see what is happening.

<h3>Greece ‚Äì inequality is falling, yet everyone is losing</h3>
A last example makes clear that we should not focus on economic inequality alone: Greece has seen substantial reductions in inequality, yet the fall in incomes outweighs this development.

In the period 1974-86, inequality fell sharply, as the poorest in society saw the largest improvements in living standards and the richest saw the weakest. Throughout the period displayed, the poorest parts of the income distribution experienced the largest gains. The economic crisis in Greece has meant a severe drop in living standards, incomes for the poorest are back to where they were in the 1980s.

The data shown for Greece are taken from the OECD.

<h3>Median income growth</h3>
The visualisation shows median income growth over time. While median incomes in the US have been almost stagnant over 3 decades, the populations of other rich countries have experienced substantial income gains. The median households in Spain, the UK and Norway in particular are much better off than 3 decades earlier.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Definition of incomes</h3>
The decile cut-offs and means are calculated on the basis of disposable household income. The measure of disposable household income employed in the Luxembourg Income Study Database is paid employment and self-employment income, capital income, transfer income, which includes social security transfers (work-related insurance transfers, universal benefits, and assistance benefits) and private transfers, minus income taxes and social security contributions. This follows the definitions of the Canberra Group.

The income definition is visualized in the following Figure.

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Figure-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7727 size-large" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Figure-2-750x492.png" alt="Definition of household equivalent disposable income" width="750" height="492" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h3>The ‚Äòequivalence scale‚Äô</h3>
Two households on the same income but one comprising a single individual and another a couple with two children will have differing living standards, because a household with several individuals benefits from economies of scale in consumption. We include both equivalised and per capita decile information in the database. For per capita income, we calculate household income and divide it by the number of household members. For equivalised income, we assume economies of scale by applying the square root of the household size as the equivalence scale. Both per capita and equivalised income assume equal sharing of income across individuals within a household.
<h3>Data on CPI and deflators</h3>
To use income levels to measure living standards, the income measures are corrected for changes in price levels over time and in purchasing power across countries. We use the consumer price index (CPI, from OECD Consumer Prices (MEI), all items) to deflate household income. To convert to a common currency we apply Purchasing Power Parities for actual individual consumption to household incomes sourced from OECD National Accounts. We express all PPP-adjusted figures in 2011 international dollars. We provide all incomes in both nominal terms and in inflation-adjusted 2011 international dollars in the full database that is directly available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Thewissen-et-al.-2016-Incomes-across-the-distribution-database.xlsx">here</a>.
<h3>Gini index</h3>
The gini index is the most commonly used inequality measure and is explained <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<p>Much of this article here and of the measurement of materialism and post-materialism in general is based on a measure proposed by Ronald Inglehart in 1971.[ref]This highly cited (&gt;1200) article is Inglehart, Ronald 1971: The silent revolution in Europe. Intergenerational change in post-industrial societies. In: American Political Science Review 65 (4), 1971. Online <a href="http://costa.wustl.edu/teaching/IntroComp/Reading/inglehart1971.pdf">here</a> at the website of Washinton University St. Louis.</p>
<p>For a short overview of¬†the evolution and discussion of various measures of post-materialism, see section 2 of Oliver Hansen and Richard S. J. Tol (2003) ‚Äì¬†Refined Inglehart Index Of Materialism And Postmaterialism. Working Papers from Research unit Sustainability and Global Change, Hamburg University. Online <a href="http://www.fnu.zmaw.de/fileadmin/fnu-files/publication/working-papers/inglehart.pdf">here</a>. [/ref]<br />
In this article he proposed the measure that is now called Inglehart's¬† Post-Materialist index (4-item).[ref]This is the name of the index in the <a href="http://www.wvsevsdb.com">World Value Survey</a>. [/ref]</p>
<p>The following survey question is the starting point for measuring materialism or post-materialism: "If you had to choose among the following things, which are the two that seem most desirable to you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining order in the nation.</li>
<li>Giving the people more say in important political decisions.</li>
<li>Fighting rising prices.</li>
<li>Protecting freedom of speech."</li>
</ul>
<p>The measure is then based on the consideration that two of the items ‚Äì the 1st and 3rd ‚Äì were regarded as indicating "'acquisitive value preferences' as they relate to the protection and acquisition of property." If the two post-materialist items are chosen the score is¬†3, if one post-materialist is chosen the score is 2, otherwise it is 1. As all of the choices might be desirable, the measure relates to the 'relative priority' of the materialistic choices over the 2nd and 4th policy goals and addresses the trade-offs that are typical for political choices. The conceptualization of post-materialism along a uni-dimensional continuum is close to the concept of the 'hierarchy of needs' proposed by Maslow. 'Inglehart‚Äôs theory of value change is one that assumes a linear progression in discrete steps upwards of Maslow‚Äôs pyramid'.[ref]Held, M., J. M√ºller, F. Deutsch, E. Grzechnik &amp; C. Welzel (2009). ‚ÄúValue Structure and Dimensions. Empirical Evidence from the German World Values Survey.‚Äù World Values Research 2(3):55-76. Online <a href="http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/paperseries_31/files/WVR_02_03_Held%20et%20al">here</a>.[/ref]</p>
<p>This very simple indicator was understandably only the starting point for measuring post-materialism. Inglehart himself proposed a more comprehensive 12-item measure.[ref]This measure is also included in the World Value Survey.<br />
The relevant literature is Inglehart, Ronald (1977) ‚Äì The silent revolution. Changing values and political styles among Western Publics. Princeton: Princeton University Press and Inglehart, Ronald (1990) ‚Äì Culture shift in advanced industrial society. Princeton: Princeton University Press.[/ref] A weakness of the 4-item indicator, according to Inglehart himself, was that it is ‚Äúexcessively sensitive to short-term forces‚Äù.</p>
<p>The 12-item measure is based on the following set of questions:[ref]This is reprinted from Held, M., J. M√ºller, F. Deutsch, E. Grzechnik &amp; C. Welzel (2009). ‚ÄúValue Structure and Dimensions.

There are two reasons to split the presentation this way. Firstly, the availability and quality of data for wars after World War II is much better than for the time before, and secondly, as I show below, there are good reasons to think that the observed decline in wars since 1945 is driven by a number of forces whose influence grew¬†since 1945.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The Absolute Number of War Deaths is Declining since 1945</h3>
The absolute number of war deaths has been declining since 1946. In some years in the early post-war era, around half a million people died in wars; in contrast, in 2007 (the last year for which I have data) the number of all war deaths was down to 22.139.

The detailed numbers for 2007 also show which deaths are counted as war deaths:[ref]This statistic is taken from the¬†¬†<em>Human Security Report Project</em> ‚Äì Miniatlas of human security (accessed April 2013). It provides data on the global number of war deaths. It is available online¬†<a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/Deaths-from-Organized-Violence.aspx">here</a>.[/ref]
<ul>
	<li>Number of State-Based Battle Deaths: 16773</li>
	<li>Number of Non-State Battle Deaths: 1865</li>
	<li>Number of One Sided Violence Deaths: 3501</li>
	<li>The<em> total sum of the above</em>¬†is: 22139. This is the number of all war deaths on our planet in 2007.</li>
</ul>
The decline of the absolute number of battle deaths is visualized in the following graph that shows global battle deaths per year by world region. There are three marked peaks in war deaths since then: the Korean War (early 1950s), the Vietnam War (around 1970) and the Iran-Iraq and Afghanistan wars (1980s).

<h3>The Share of War Deaths is Declining even Faster</h3>
The previous graph showed absolute numbers, but as the world has seen rapid population growth (see our entry on¬†<a title="World Population Growth" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/">global population growth</a>), it is more appropriate to look at relative numbers. The following graph therefore shows the battle deaths per 100,000 people per year.¬†The figures are shown by type of conflict.
<h6>Rate of battle deaths in state-based armed conflicts by type of conflict, 1946-2013 ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The data from 1946 to 2008 are based on the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset v.3.0. The page presenting this data is online <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/State-Based-Battle-Deaths-by-Type.aspx">here</a>.

Data for 2008 to 2013 were provided by Steven Pinker who published these estimates in Steven Pinker and Andrew Mack (Dec 2014) ‚Äì The World Is Not Falling Apart, in Slate magazine <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html">here</a>.
These estimates are based on data from 2 institutes that frequently collaborate: the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) provided all data but the data for the Syrian conflict in 2013 which were provided by PRIO. The estimate for Syria used here is the ‚ÄúHigh Estimate‚Äù since PRIO did not publish a ‚ÄúBest Estimate‚Äù.[/ref]

<h3>The Number of Wars¬†Increased¬†until the End of the Cold War</h3>
As we have seen, the number of war victims varies hugely between different wars; whereas 1,200,000 died during the the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953), other wars had 'just' 1,000 victims. For this reason, statistics on the number of wars should not be considered without information on the size of these conflicts.

The following figure shows that the number of wars increased until the breakdown of the Soviet Union and has been decreasing since then. Extrastate conflicts are colonial conflicts that ended with the end of colonialism. Interstate conflicts ‚Äì wars fought between countries ‚Äì have almost ceased to exist. As other wars are becoming rare, intrastate conflicts (civil wars) in some parts of the world remain.
<h6>Number of state-based armed conflicts by type, 1946-2007 ‚Äì¬†Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The data is taken from the Human Security Report Project which is taking data from the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset v.3.0.

The increase in the number of wars shown before is predominantly an increase of smaller and smaller conflicts. This follows from the previously shown facts that the number of war victims declined while the number of conflicts increased. The decreasing deadliness of conflicts is shown in the following graph.
<h6>Deadliness of wars - average battle deaths per conflict by decade, 1950-2007 ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The data on which the calculation is based was taken from the Human Security Report Project which is taking data from the PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset v.3.0. The two used datasets are: the Battle Deaths from State-Based Armed Conflicts by Type of Conflict, 1946-2007 (online <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/State-Based-Battle-Deaths-by-Type.aspx">here</a>) and the number of State-Based Armed Conflicts by Type, 1946-2007 (online <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/State-Based-Armed-Conflicts-By-Type.aspx">here</a>). The graph shows for each decade the sum of battle deaths per conflict devided by the number of conflicts of that type.[/ref] <iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/nvd3/nvd3_multiBarChart_DeadlinessPerConflictPerTypePerDecade/DeadlinessPerConflictPerTypePerDecade.html" width="100%" height="545" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<h3>Ongoing Wars</h3>
Information on ongoing wars that is always up-to-date can be found at¬†<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_wars">Wikipedia's List of Ongoing Military Conflicts</a>.

After the documented decline of war, large parts of the world have now been peaceful for an unprecedented long period. Although wars are still fought, the world is now more peaceful than ever.[ref]For more information on this claim have a look at¬†Mueller (2009) - War Has Almost Ceased to Exist: An Assessment. In Political Science Quarterly, 124, 2, 297--321.¬†and Pinker (2011) ‚Äì The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. Viking Adult.[/ref]
<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<strong>Definition of War</strong> Most data are taken from the PRIO/UCDP dataset. The following definitions quoted from the <a href="http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/Definitions.aspx">website¬†of the Human Security Report Project</a>¬†apply:
<ul>
	<li>A conflict is coded as a war when the battle-death toll reaches 1,000 or more in a given calendar year.
<ul>
	<li>An extrastate armed conflict is a conflict between a state and an armed group outside the state‚Äôs own territory. These are mostly colonial conflicts.</li>
	<li>An interstate armed conflict is a conflict fought between two or more states. An intrastate armed conflict (also known as a civil conflict) is a conflict between a government and a non-state group that takes place largely within the territory of the state in question.</li>
	<li>An intrastate armed conflict becomes an internationalized intrastate armed conflict when the government, or an armed group opposing it, receives support, in the form of troops, from one or more foreign states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

The first chart shows the total fertility rate for the entire world population at 5 different points in time. The total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. More specifically, it tells you the average number of children that would be born to a woman (who would live until the end of her childbearing years) if she were to experience the exact <em>current</em> age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.

<em><strong>How to read the following graph:</strong> On the x-axis you find the cumulative share of the world population. The countries are ordered along the x-axis descending by the country's fertility rate. This makes it possible to see the fertility rate for each country, and it is also possible to see which share of the world population had a fertility rate higher than a given level. For the blue line ‚Äì referring to the latest data (2005-10) ‚Äì we see that 20% of the world population have a fertility rate of higher than 3.
</em>

For 1950-55 (red line), you see that the countries on the very left ‚Äì Rwanda, Kenya, the Philippines and others that are not labelled ‚Äì¬†had a fertility rate of more than 7. China had a fertility rate of just over 6 and India a fertility rate of just under 6! On the very right of the red line you see that in 1950-55 there was only one country in the world¬† with a fertility rate below 2: tiny Luxembourg.

Looking at the orange line, you see that until 1975-80 some countries substantially reduced their fertility: India's fertility rate fell to a still very high 4.9, and China's fell to 3. Other countries maintained¬†very high fertility levels. In Yemen, the fertility rate was 8.6 children per woman.

The latest data from the UN refers to 2005-2010. 80% of the world population lives in countries where women have on average fewer than 3 children. The global average fertility rate is 2.5. This means that global fertility is barely higher than the global replacement fertility. The replacement fertility is the total fertility rate at which the population size stays constant. If there were no mortality in the female population until the end of the childbearing years, the replacement fertility would be exactly 2. With the <a title="Child Mortality" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/child-mortality/">current level of mortality</a> the global replace fertility is 2.3 ‚Äì the narrow gap between the current global fertility and the global replacement rate means that the <a title="World Population Growth" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/">increase of the world population</a> is due to the <a title="Life Expectancy" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/life-expectancy/">increasing length of life</a> and population momentum.[ref]Population momentum occurs ‚Äì <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/modules/social/pgr/index02.html">as the World Bank explains</a> ‚Äì "when a large proportion of a country‚Äôs population is of childbearing age. Even if the fertility rate of people in developing countries reaches replacement level, that is if couples have only enough children to replace themselves when they die, for several decades the absolute numbers of people being born still will exceed the numbers of people dying."[/ref]

We also see convergence in fertility rates: the countries that already¬†had low fertility in the 1950s only slightly decreased fertility, while many of the countries that had the highest fertility back then saw a rapid reduction of the number of children per woman.

Comparing the red, orange and blue lines also makes it possible to see the change in single countries: In Iran, the fertility rate in 1980-85 was 6.3; in the latest data we see that it is down to the level of Sweden: 1.9 children per woman. In Thailand, the fertility rate in 1950-55 was 6.14, in 1980-85 it was 3.92, and today it is 1.49.

In the chart I have also included the projections for the 21st century. The UN ‚Äì <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/future-world-population-growth/#world-population-size-estimates-of-the-world-population-compared-with-the-un-forecasts-since-1950-keilman-2001ref">which has a very good track record for its past demographic projections</a> ‚Äì expects global fertility to fall further in most countries so that the rate will be below 2 by the end of the century.

<h3>Fertility was high in the time before population growth</h3>
The table shows that in European countries one woman gave¬†on average birth to 4.5 to 6.2 children in the 18th century. The population of a society does not increase when every woman is replaced on average by two children. As the tables presents fertility rates when the population <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/grapher/public/view/169">did not yet grow rapidly</a> we can infer that on average 2.5 to 4.2 children died per woman.

<h3>Fertility can decline extremely fast</h3>
The decline of fertility is one of the most fundamental social changes that happened in human history.

It is therefore especially surprising how very rapidly this transition can indeed happen. As we see from the chart below it took Iran only 10 years for fertility to fall from more than 6 children per woman to fewer than 3 children per woman. (Iran made this transition under a conservative Muslim government.)

We also see from the chart that the speed with which countries can achieve low fertility has increased over time. A century ago it took the United Kingdom 95 years and the US 82 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 to less than 3. This is a pattern that we see often in development: those countries that first experience social change take much longer for transitions than those who catch up later: Countries that were catching up increased <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/">life expectancy</a> much faster, they reduced <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a> more quickly and were able to grow their incomes much more rapidly.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>When more children survive fertility decreases</h3>
On the y-axis we measure the number of annual live births per 1,000 people. On the x-axis we measure how many infants, who were born alive, survive their 1st year of life ‚Äì this is the <em>infant survival rate.</em>

The chart shows how these two aspects changed over the course of the 20th century: At the beginning of the century all 4 countries can be found in the upper left corner ‚Äì they are characterized by high fertility and an infant survival rate below 85%. If we follow the 4 lines we are taken to the bottom right corner and see that women have fewer children when the mortality rate of babies goes down.

The causal link between infant survival and fertility is established in both directions: Firstly, increasing infant survival reduces the parents‚Äô demand for children. And secondly, a decreasing fertility allows the parents to devote more attention and resources to their children.
<h6>Infant survival and fertility through time ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The data is taken from the International Historical Statistics (IHS), edited by Palgrave Macmillan Ltd. (April 2013). The online version is available <a href="http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137305688">here</a>. As a printed version it is published by <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=275960">Palgrave</a>.

The child survival rate is calculated using the IHS Data 'Deaths Of Infants Under One Year Old Per 1,000 Live Births'.[/ref]

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scatter-Fertility-vs-Infant-Survival.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7683" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Scatter-Fertility-vs-Infant-Survival-750x536.png" alt="Scatter-Fertility-vs-Infant-Survival" width="750" height="536" /></a>

The following chart takes a global perspective on the same phenomenon: The chart shows data for all countries in the world over more than 5 decade. For each country in the world I plotted the level of child survival and fertility for all years. We see that the regularity that the previous chart showed is also true for the world as a whole, as more children survive the number of children per woman is declining.

Emphasized is the world average in blue: For the world as a whole we see this connection between child health and fertility. Every 5th child born in 1960 died during childhood; corresponding to this high level of child mortality the fertility rate was very high: Women in the world had 5 children on average! Over the following 5 decades child health improved globally and 96% of the children born in 2014 survived childhood; correspondingly global fertility declined and in fact is now less than half the level of 1960 (2.45 per woman).

This link between fertility and child mortality is an immensely important insight and tells us what drives the acceleration and slowdown of population growth: In the initial stage of the transition, when fertility rates are still high but health is already improving, the population starts to grow. But then, a bit later, we see that this transition works to decrease population growth since improving health of the children leads to lower fertility. It is an important part of the mechanism behind the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/population-growth-vital-statistics/world-population-growth/#demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>.

A very cynical view is that a decrease in child mortality is bad for the world since it would contribute to the overpopulation of the planet. The chart below shows that this opinion is not just¬†contemptuous of human life but plainly wrong: When more infants survive fertility goes down and the temporary population growth comes to an end. If we want to ensure that the world‚Äôs population increase comes to an end soon we must work to increase child survival.

<h3>The richer the people, the lower the fertility</h3>
The following plot shows the close relation between the income level (measured by GDP per capita) and the total fertility rate. It is not just showing country averages but also taking the within-country inequality into account: For most poor countries it shows the fertility by wealth quintile against the income quintile in the same country.

<h3>Fertility is first falling with development ‚Äì and then rising with development</h3>
We have already seen that as a country develops ‚Äì child mortality declines and incomes grow ‚Äì the fertility declines rapidly.

The demographers Mikko Myrskyl√§, Hans-Peter Kohler &amp; Francesco Billari studied what happens at very high levels of development. To measure development they relied on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index/">Human Development Index</a> ‚Äì a measure published by the UN that combines with equal weight indicators of a country's health, material living standards and level of education.

In their study ‚Äì published in <em>Nature</em> in 2009[ref]Mikko Myrskyl√§, Hans-Peter Kohler &amp; Francesco C. Billari (2009) ‚Äì Advances in development reverse fertility declines. Nature 460, 741-743 (6 August 2009) | doi:10.1038/nature08230; Online at <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08230.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08230.html</a>[/ref] ‚Äì they found "a fundamental change in the well-established negative relationship between fertility and development as the global population entered the twenty-first century."

The visualization below shows their finding. Again they found the strong negative association between a country's level of development and the fertility level. But the most recent data also indicate that at very high levels of development ‚Äì HDI over 0.85 or even 0.9 ‚Äì this association is reversed. Higher development then leads to increasing fertility.

In the paper the authors do not only show this relationship cross-sectionally but also over time: after reaching the lowest Total Fertility Rate at HDI values between 0.85 and 0.9 fertility then increased again as countries advanced to the highest development levels.

It is a finding with important consequences. The authors note that this reversal¬† "has the potential to slow the rates of population ageing, thereby ameliorating the social and economic problems that have been associated with the emergence and persistence of very low fertility".

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
Fertility is measured in different period and cohort measures:
<h3>Period Measures</h3>
The definition of the<strong>¬†crude birth rate</strong> (CBR) ‚Äì or simply birth rate ‚Äì is "the number of live births occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year".[ref]This definition is quoted after the OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=490">here</a>.[/ref]

The<strong>¬†total fertility rate</strong>¬†(TFR)[ref]Similar definitions are given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_rate">Wikipedia</a>, by the <a href="http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/fertility.htm">United Nation's Population Division</a>, by the <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/01/01/02/index.html?itemId=/content/chapter/factbook-2013-2-en">OECD</a> and the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN">World Bank</a>.

The Total Fertility Rate is also called <em>Period Total Fertility Rate (PTFR)</em> or <em>Total Period Fertility Rate</em> <em>(TPFR)</em>.[/ref] ‚Äì or simply Fertility Rate ‚Äì is defined as the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if:
<ol>
 	<li>The woman were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime, and</li>
 	<li>The woman were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life.</li>
</ol>
It is expressed as <em>children per woman</em>.

The <strong>age-specific fertility rate (ASFR)</strong> "measures the annual number of births to women of a specified age or age group per 1,000 women in that age group."[ref]This is the definition given in the UN's <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WFR2009_Web/Data/Meta_Data/ASFR.pdf">World Fertility Report 2009</a>.[/ref]
<h3>Cohort Measures</h3>
The <strong>n</strong><strong>et reproduction rate (NRR)</strong> is defined as "the average number of daughters a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates and the mortality rates of a given period. It is expressed as number of daughters per woman".[ref]This is the definition given by the United Nations World Population Prospects here http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/fertility.htm . [/ref]
<h3>Incomplete civil registration</h3>
Civil registration systems register vital events ‚Äì births, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages and divorces ‚Äì for governments. As such they are a key source for vital statistics and fertility measures. As the following map shows the civil registration coverage of births is incomplete in many countries in Africa and Asia.
<h6>Civil registration coverage of births (in percent) ‚Äì latest available data (in 2014) ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The data is taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) online <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.121">here</a>.

The data refers to the latest available statistic for each country available at the data source in February 2014. For most countries this is 2011 although it goes as far back as 2006 for some others.[/ref]

<h3>Within-country differences</h3>
A second aspect about country level data of fertility to keep in mind is that there can be considerable heterogeneity <em>within</em> countries, which are hidden in the mean fertility which were discussed in this entry. The mean Total Fertility Rate for India in 2010 was 2.8 (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=IND">UN Data</a>): But this average hides the fact that the fertility in many Southern Indian regions was below 1.5 (which is similar to the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?year=2015&amp;region=Europe">mean fertility in many European countries</a>), while the fertility in Northern India was still higher than 5 children per woman (which is as high as the mean <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?year=2015&amp;region=Africa">of the African countries with the highest fertility</a>).

Human height is determined by a combination of genetics and environmental factors making it an active area of research in both the sciences and social sciences. Recent breakthroughs in sequencing the human genome have allowed identification of 697 genetic variants that influence the height of an individual.[ref] In a study of over 250,000 individuals using genome-wide data, the study¬†was able to identify 697 variants that determine an individuals height. The research was published in nature genetics and can be found <a title="Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height" href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n11/full/ng.3097.html" target="_blank">here</a>. [/ref]¬†Although genetics plays an important role in understanding variation within a given population, human growth can be limited by poor childhood nutrition and illness. This makes height strongly correlated with living standards and hence a good proxy for them. Changes to heights over time and within countries paints a picture of economic development. One major advantage of using height as a proxy is the availability of data in the pre-statistical period.

It is important to stress that height is not used as a direct measure of well-being. In the absence of any abnormality or extremes, we should not expect that changing an individual‚Äôs height makes them any more or less happy all other things being equal.
<h3>Global Perspective of Increase of Human Height</h3>
Human height has steadily increased over the past two centuries across the globe. This trend is in line with general improvements in health and nutrition during this period. Historical data on heights tends to come from soldiers (conscripts), convicted criminals, slaves and servants. It is for this reason much of the historical data focuses on men. Recent data on heights uses additional sources including surveys and medical records.

<h3>The Last¬†Two Millennia</h3>
Over the last two millennia, human height, based off of skeletal remains, has stayed¬†fairly steady, oscillating around 170cm. With the onset of modernity, we see a massive spike in heights in the developed world. It is worth noting that using skeletal remains is subject to measurement error with respect to the estimated height and time period.

<h3>Mesolithic Times, Middle Ages, Subsistence Societies and Modern Foragers</h3>
Though in general, human height has increased around the world, the following tables demonstrate that this trend is not universal. This first table shows the heights of men in modern foraging and subsistence societies. Many of these heights are lower than in the second table, which shows the heights of skeletal remains in various pre-modern periods. This would seem to indicate that human height is closely related to the lifestyle prevalent in a society, including the type of food consumed, the type of work undertaken, and the climate.

<h3>The Effects of Immigration on Height Differences</h3>
In a pioneering study of Japanese immigrants to Hawaii published in 1939, Harry Shapiro found there to be a significant difference between the heights of Hawaiian-born Japanese and the Japanese immigrant population.[ref] Shapiro H (1939) Migration and Environment: a study of the physical characteristics of the Japanese immigrants to Hawaii and the effects of environment on their descendants. Oxford University Press [/ref] Shapiro concluded that environmental factors, particularly diet and healthcare, play a significant role in determining height and other physical characteristics. The underlying idea here is that migration from poor countries to rich ones may lead to dramatic changes between generations. In a similar study, Marcus Goldstein (1943) found there to be differences in the heights and other characteristics of the children of Mexican immigrants and their parents, as well as with native born Mexican children.[ref]Goldstein MS (1943) Demographic and Bodily Changes in Descendants of Mexican Immigrants. Austin, TX: University of Texas Institute of Latin American Studies[/ref]
<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Other Development Indicators¬†and Human Height</h3>
Since height is¬†used as a proxy for development, it should be strongly correlated with other indicators of development. The most common indicators of development are income, education and health.

There appears to be a very strong positive correlation between income and height.

<p style="text-align: left;">We see here that wages and height are positively correlated in Brazil, with a much weaker correlation in the United States. There¬†exists a similar relationship between education and height within both countries. Differences in the compulsory schooling age between the two countries may go some way to explaining the weaker relationship found in the United States.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We see a decline in the relative mortality of men aged 40-59¬†as height increases, suggesting that taller individuals may be healthier than their shorter counterparts.</p>

<h3>Why are Africans so tall?</h3>
When we exclude the richest countries from our sample we find that the positive correlation between income and height becomes negative. This result is due to Africans being significantly taller than their Asian and Latin American counterparts. Research by Deaton also¬†finds¬†a negative correlation exists for nutrition, risk of disease and women's education when comparing Africa to the same group of countries. While this may appear to indicate that the difference could be down to genetic factors, Deaton argues that this is unlikely to be the case since we do not observe any significant difference between the heights of Americans of Caucasian descent compared with Americans of African descent. Instead Deaton suggests it may be due to dietary differences and child mortality. Dietary differences (vegetarian diets in Asia) and the way each respective population¬†has adapted to poverty could generate the observed results. Additionally,¬†higher rates of child mortality in Africa cause the smallest and weakest children to die early before reaching maturity.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
Accurately measuring the height of an individual is a straightforward task and so we should be confident that there is¬†relatively little measurement error in the recorded data. This is unlikely to be the case when measuring the height of skeletons. What is more, the techniques used to date skeletal remains (such as radio carbon dating) only provide a probabilistic estimate.

Another factor to consider is the potential sample bias from the historical sources. Since the height data is¬†largely composed of soldiers, criminals, salves and servants, these groups may not be representative of the wider population. This problem has been highlighted by academics researching human height.[ref]Howard Bodenhorn, Timothy W. Guinnane, and Thomas Mroz. Biased samples yield biased results: What historical heights can teach us about past living standards. Vox CEPR Policy Portal (2015). Available online <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/what-historical-heights-can-teach-us-about-past-living-standards" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] In fact, the observed drop in height during the industrial revolution -- usually attributed to the negative health impacts of industrialisation -- can be explained by the labour market conditions that existed at the time. They argue that "as economies grew, tight labour markets discouraged military enlistments by the most productive workers, with those enlisting (and being measured) increasingly over-representing the less advantaged members of society."

By comparing the heights of soldiers in the US army with countries that enforced conscription we can see the bias more clearly. In countries that had conscription, the average height of conscripts was increasing over the period, meanwhile in the US where entry was voluntary, the heights of soldiers was falling

Another issue is that there existed almost no systematic recording of women's heights meaning¬†there is very little historical data on the heights of women.

<h3>Deaths Due to Malaria</h3>
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the WHO has published global estimates of the number of people that die from malaria. In these 15 years the global death toll has been cut in half: from 839,000 deaths in 2000 to 438,000 in 2015. 
Africa is the world region that is most affected by malaria: In 2015, the African continent held 9 out of 10 malaria victims (click on 'Expand' to see this). But Africa is also the world region that has achieved most progress: from 2000 to 2015, African deaths from malaria were reduced from 764,000 to 395,000.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
In the first chart on this page, we see that the number of malaria deaths in Africa is now declining. The following chart shows that over the same period the number of people sleeping under insecticide treated nets increased.

Several recent research papers and books have made it possible to follow the rise of book production in Europe. The crucial event was the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg around 1440, after which the efficiency¬†of book production increased, prices decreased and consumption of books subsequently increased. This post will give an overview of the history between 500 and 1800.
<h3>Production of Manuscripts and Books from 500 to 1800</h3>
The increased production of manuscripts and books was estimated by Buringh and Van Zanden (2009). Table 1 and 2 reproduce the following two datasets of the authors:
Estimates of manuscripts produced between 500 and 1500 based on a database of 17,352 manuscripts produced in Western Europe.
Estimates of the number of books printed between 1454 and 1800.

The unit of analysis for the estimates of manuscripts is the number of individual manuscripts. The unit of analysis for the estimates of printed books is (new) 'title' or 'edition'. The authors corrected the numbers to account for the underrepresentation of estimates for different geographical regions and different times. The authors consider their estimates to be conservative and note that the ‚Äúfigures should be interpreted as low estimates‚Äù.

Titles are either books (which have by definition more than 49 pages) or pamphlets (less than 50 pages). The authors define a title as 'a printed publication which forms a separate whole, whether issued in one or several volumes. Different language versions of the same title published in a particular country should be considered as individual titles'; this includes first editions and reeditions. The authors give the following example: 'The first printing of Gutenberg‚Äôs Bible is one title, and new editions of the Bible will again be counted, but a reprint of exactly the same manuscript would not be included.'

The rise of the actual number of books is even greater as Dittmar (2012) shows; the number of books printed per edition rose 1450-1600 as depicted in the first figure below.

The growth of the book sector in Western Europe over the 1300 years studied by the authors is enormous. Until the year 700, around 120 books per year were produced, but a millenium later in¬†1790 20 million copies were printed. The most decisive development for the increased book production was the invention of the printing press. Buringh &amp; Van Zanden note: "in the year 1550 alone, for example, some 3 million books were produced in Western Europe, more than the total number of manuscripts produced during the fourteenth century as a whole".
<h3>Prices of Books: Productivity in Book Production</h3>
The increased demand of books was driven by a huge decrease in the price of books. The smaller¬†price was possible by the increased efficiency¬†in the production of books since the invention of the printing press around 1440. Clark (2008) measures the subsequent productivity increase as the ratio between the wage of building craftsmen and the price of a book and finds a 20-fold increase in productivity in the first 200 years after the invention, as shown in the following graph.
<h6>Productivity in book production in England, 1470s‚Äì1860s ‚Äì Clark (2008)[ref]</h6>
This Figure is taken from Clark (2008) - A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World (Princeton University Press, 2008). Productivity is indexed to 1 for the 1470s.[/ref]

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1_users_maxroser_documents_progress_lyx_books_p___roduction_in_england__1470s___1860s_-_clark-png.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1_users_maxroser_documents_progress_lyx_books_p___roduction_in_england__1470s___1860s_-_clark-png.png" alt="1_Users_maxroser_Documents_Progress_LyX_Books_P___roduction_in_England__1470s___1860s_-_Clark.png" width="462" height="281" /></a>

Productivity is measured as the ratio between the wage of building craftsmen and the price of a book of standard characteristics. Clark notes that ‚Äúwith both hand production and the printing press the main cost in book production was labor (paper and parchment production costs were mainly labor costs).‚Äù

Clark (2008) notes that copyists before the time of the printing press were able to copy 3,000 words of plain text per day. This implies that the production of one copy of the Bible meant 136 days of work. Eisenstein[ref]Eisenstein (1980) - The Printing Press as an Agent of Change (Cambridge University Press, 1980).[/ref] is able to compare the price of paying a scribe to duplicating a translation of Plato's Dialogues with the price for duplicating the same work by the Ripoli printing press in Florence in 1483. For three florins the Ripoli Press produced 1,025 copies whereas the scribe would produce one copy for one florin. This implies that the cost per book decreased 341 times with the introduction of the printing press.

A long run perspective of the real price of books in the Netherlands between 1460 and 1800 is depicted in the figure below.

<h3>Increasing Variation of Genres and the Rise of Fiction Literature</h3>
Another fundamental change in the book market after the invention of the book press was a very strong increase in the variety of printed books available to the readers. Dittmar (2012) measures the subject content by employing techniques from machine learning to identify the topics of books in his sample of English books between the late 1400s and 1700. He can thereby identify a specified number of topics in his sample and track the changes in variety over time. He depicts the increased consumer choice by calculating the Herfindahl index of topic concentration ‚Äì this is reprinted in Panel A of the figure below.¬†Panel B shows how the number of effective variety of consumer choices grew sharply after 1500. The increasing variety represents the end of the dominating role of theological texts ‚Äì Dittmar (2012) notes that 'almost all books were on religious topics in the late 1400s'.
<h6>Topic concentration and effective consumer variety of books, before 1700 ‚Äì Dittmar (2012)[ref]</h6>
This figure is taken from Dittmar (2012).[/ref]

<a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/topic-concentration-and-effective-consumer-variety-of-books-png.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-569" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/topic-concentration-and-effective-consumer-variety-of-books-png.png" alt="Topic-concentration-and-effective-consumer-Variety-of-Books.png" width="589" height="360" /></a>

The following pie chart gives an overview of the variety of book topics in London's book market in 1700. Looking at the variety of books at that time ‚Äì the end of Dittmar's sample ‚Äì makes one realize how dominant theological texts were before. The data source for this figure is the English Short Title Catalog or ESTC which is also one of the two sources of Dittmar.

A subsequent change in the variety of topics was the rise of fiction literature. This marked change between the 17th and the 18th century is depicted below. From the table above¬†we know that the total number of books published during this time did not change ‚Äì in the 50 years before 1700 89,306,000 books were published in Great Britain; in the 50 years after 1700 it was 89,259,000.

<h3>Consumption of Books</h3>
The declining price of books and the increasing literacy led to an increase in the consumption of books, as can be seen in the following table.

<h3>Inequality in Pre-industrial Societies</h3>
One way of studying pre-industrial inequality is to study the inequality of living standards (for this see the entry on <a title="Health Inequality" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/health/health-inequality/">health inequality</a>). But one can also¬†study economic inequality directly. Milanovic, Lindert and Williamson published a number of these estimates in their 2008 paper 'Ancient Inequality'. Most of their estimates (18 of the 28) of pre-industrial inequalities are based on so-called 'social tables'. In these tables, social classes (or groups) 'are ranked from the richest to the poorest with their estimated population shares and average incomes'.[ref]Cited from Milanovic, Lindert and Williamson (2008) ‚Äì Ancient Inequality. In The Economic Journal. Volume 121, Issue 551, pages 255‚Äì272, March 2011. Online <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02403.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false">here</a>.

A short version that is freely available was published on VoxEU online <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/ancient-income-inequality">here</a>.[/ref]

These social tables are not always reliable sources for the distribution of incomes, as Holmes has shown for one of the most famous tables: Gregory King's Social Table for England in 1688. Holmes (1977) showed King's limitations as a social analyst and critisices his social table arguing that various biases "beguiled him (1) into underestimating the number of families in some of the wealthiest, and fiscally most productive classes; and (2) into underestimating quite (sometimes grossly) income levels at many rungs above the poverty line."[ref]The publication is G. S. Holmes (1977) ‚Äì Gregory King and the Social Structure of Pre-Industrial England. Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fifth Series, Vol. 27 (1977), pp. 41-68. Online <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3679187">here</a>.

The estimates shown in the graph below are based on a revision of King's estimates that was published by Lindert and Williamson. The authors are saying they were using "Holmes‚Äô penetrating critique (1977) to guide our modification of King‚Äôs tables". This publication is Lindert, Peter H. and Williamson, Jeffrey G (1982) ‚Äì Revising England's social tables 1688-1812. Explorations in Economic History.

The following graph demonstrates the economic inequality of pre-industrial societies in relation to the level of prosperity in this society. Inequality is measured with the Gini index (explained below) and prosperity is measured by GDP per capita, adjusted for price changes to make comparisons in a common currency possible.

The graph also shows a curve labelled IPF; this is the Inequality Possibility Frontier. The idea behind this curve is that in a very poor society inequality cannot be very high: Imagine the <em>average</em> level of income is just the bare minimum to survive; in such a economy there could not possibly be any inequality as this would necessarily mean that some people have to be below the minimum income level on which they could survive.

When average income is a little higher it is possible to have some small level of inequality, and the IPF shows how the maximum possible inequality increases with higher average income. Now we see that many pre-industrial societies are clustered along the IPF. <strong>This means that in these societies inequality was as high as it possibly could have been.</strong>

For Holland and England, we see that during their early development they moved away from the IPF and the level of inequality no longer was at the maximum.

<h3>Income Inequality over the Very Long Run</h3>
The United Kingdom is the country for which we have the best information on the distribution of income over the very long run. And this information is visualized in the following chart: On top

The income share of the top 5% of income earners was very high in the past: Up to 40% of total income went into the pockets of the very rich. It increased slightly until the onset of industrialization. Both measures ‚Äì the top income share and the Gini index ‚Äì confirm this.

Starting in the late 19th century income inequality started to decrease dramatically and reached historical lows in the late 1970s. Though it never reached pre-industrial levels income inequality increased¬† sharply in the 1980s.

The bottom panel shows the Gini of both pre-tax income and the lower inequality of disposable income. Disposable income is the income that reaches people's pockets after the welfare state redistributed the income through tax and transfers.

<h3>Inequality over the Last Century</h3>
The following two graphs demonstrate how inequality has developed over the last century. Researchers have a much better understanding of the long run evolution thanks to the new research on top income shares. Before the study of top incomes the main source for information on the income distribution were surveys. But since surveys in most countries were only started in the 1970s or 80s we had only have data going back 3 or 4 decades. Top income shares are reconstructed from income tax records and for many countries this gives us insight into the development over more 100 years.

Top income inequality is measured as the share of total income that goes to the income earners at the very top of the distribution. This measure of inequality has the advantage that for many countries it is available for a long period of time.

What we can learn from this long-term perspective is summarized in the 2 charts below. Let‚Äôs look at the blue line in the first chart which shows the long-run trend in the US. Before the Second World War up to 18% of the all income received by Americans went to the richest 1%. Since then, the share of the top 1% first dropped substantially and then ‚Äì starting in the early 80s ‚Äìincreased again and in the US it returned to the level of the pre-war period. This means that inequality as measured by top income shares fell and then rose again and from the chart we see that this U-shaped long-term trend of top income shares is not unique to the US. In fact the development in other English-speaking countries shown in the left panel followed the same pattern.

However, it would be wrong to think that increasing top income inequality is a universal phenomenon. From the second chart we see that in equally rich European countries as well as in Japan, the development is in fact quite different. The income share of the rich has decreased over many decades and just like in the English-speaking countries it reached a low point in the 70s. In contrast to the English-speaking countries however top incomes shares have not returned to the previous high levels of inequality, but instead remained flat or increased only modestly. Top income inequality followed an L-shape. Income inequality has decreased drastically since the beginning of the 20th century ‚Äì a much smaller share of total incomes is paid to the very rich.

A lesson that that we can take away from this empirical research is that political forces at work on the national level are possibly important for how incomes are distributed. If there was a universal trend towards more inequality it would be in line with the notion that inequality is determined by global market forces and technological progress where it is very hard (or for other reasons undesirable) to change the forces that lead to higher inequality. Inequality would then be inevitable. The reality of different inequality trends within countries suggests that the institutional and political framework in different countries play a role in shaping inequality of incomes.

In the following graph, we can see this trend for other non-English speaking European nations and Japan. Inequality decreased rapidly over the first half of last century, but has only steadily declined or remained fairly stable since, forming an L-shaped curve.

<h3>Redistribution¬†as a Solution</h3>
It is not always understood what the top income share actually measures. It does not measure the income that reaches the pockets of the rich; instead it captures what is paid to the rich <em>before</em> taxes are deducted. There is a considerable difference between incomes before and after taxes: <a href="http://www.heritage.org/federalbudget/top10-percent-income-earners?nomobile">¬†In the US, 37% of the total sum of income tax is paid by the top 1% while less than 3% is paid by the bottom 50%</a>. The redistribution means that the incomes of the poor are higher after taxes (because of transfer payments) and the incomes of the rich are reduced after taxes (due to generally progressive income tax rates).

The consequence of such a progressive tax system is that the inequality of the disposable income ‚Äì the income that actually reaches people's pockets ‚Äì is much lower than the pre-tax income that is measured in the top income shares from the 1st chart.

This difference between market incomes and the disposable income is shown in the next chart. We see that the <strong>redistribution through taxes and transfers reduces inequality considerably</strong>.

In this chart inequality is measured with the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">Gini index</a>, an inequality measure that not only looks at the top of the income distribution but captures the whole distribution.

The chart shows that the market income inequality in the UK, the US, and France is fairly similar (Gini between .5 and .52), but there is a big difference in how much countries reduce inequality through redistribution. The US is a country in which inequality in both market and disposable income are steadily increasing; it stands out as a rich country that redistributes comparatively less than similarly rich countries.

The increase in the share of total wealth gained by the top 1% is largely due to an increase in wages, salaries and pensions. Entrepreneurial income has also increased since the 1970s. The second graph demonstrates each income source as a share of the total income of the 1%. It shows that wages, salaries and pensions have come to make up a larger portion of the income gained by societies wealthiest individuals. This information combined with the first graph really reinforces the immensity of the wealth gains of the top 1% over the last few decades.

We can see here that East Asian countries like Korea, Taiwan and Japan do some of the least wealth redistribution, but they also have some of the lowest levels of inequality before taxes. In contrast, Western countries like the, US, UK and Canada all have very high levels of inequality before taxes yet still do not partake in much redistribution, which leads to higher inequality than their counterparts in the Western world.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
Below we can see the correlation between increases in the income share of the top 1% and the decrease of the marginal income tax rate since 1960. The graph confirms the hypothesis that in general as tax rates decrease, the income share of the most wealthy citizens increases. The US and the UK are both extreme examples of this happening. France, Germany, Finland, Netherlands and Switzerland all contradict this trend. While the marginal income tax rate on the most wealthy has decreased, the government has implemented other means to decrease income inequality.

For the following five countries, the data start after 1960: Denmark (1980), Ireland (1975), Italy (1974), Portugal (1976), Spain (1981). For Switzerland, the data end in 1995 (they end in 2005 or after for all the other countries). Top tax rates include both the central and local government top tax rates. The correlation between those changes is very strong.</em>[/ref]<em>

It is commonly asserted¬†that what really matters is not income inequality itself but social mobility; perhaps countries with high income inequality like the US have high social mobility and easier access to economic opportunity, and this is what is important to the fairness of an economy. However, the graph below debunks this assertion. We can see that countries with high inequality (measured by the Gini index) also tend to have the lowest social mobility, as measured by the intergenerational earnings elasticity. The US has an intergenerational earnings elasticity of about 0.5, which means that about 50% of a father's earnings advantage or disadvantage will be passed on to the son.

<h4>The Gini Coefficient</h4>
The Gini coefficient ‚Äì or Gini index ‚Äì is a measure of the income distribution of a population. It was developed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini (1884-1965) and is named after him.
The following figure illustrates the definition of the Gini index: in a population in which income is perfectly equally distributed, the distribution of incomes are represented by the 'line of equality' ‚Äì 10% of the population would earn 10% of the total income, 20% would earn 20% of the total income and so on. The 'Lorenz curve' shows the income distribution in a population where income is not equally distributed ‚Äì in the example below you see that the bottom 50% of the population earn less than 20% of the total income. The Gini coefficient captures the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the 'line of equality' by comparing the areas A and B:

Gini = A / (A + B)

This means a Gini coefficient of zero represents a distribution where the Lorenz curve is just the 'Line of Equality' and incomes are perfectly equally distributed ‚Äì a value of 1 means maximal inequality (one person has all income and all others receive no income).

The Flynn effect describes the phenomenon that over time average IQ scores have been increasing in all countries since the turn of the twentieth century (the earliest point in time for which data is available). The change in IQ scores has been approximately three IQ points per decade. One major implications of this trend is that an average individual alive today would have an IQ of 130 by the standards of 1910, making them more intelligent than 98% of the population at that time. Equivalently, an individual alive in 1910 would have an IQ of 70 by today‚Äôs standards, a score that would be low enough to be considered intellectually disabled in the modern world.</p>

<p>The following charts show the estimated gain in average IQ for a selection of countries and world regions. It is important to note that this is not a reflection of how intelligent a country/region is but instead how quickly advances were being made. Cross country comparisons are of limited usefulness in this context since the data is incomplete, and we would expect developing countries to make larger gains than developed ones.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Composition of IQ Gains</h3>
<p>An important and interesting question is, "what has been driving the gains in intelligence?" There are many competing explanations from nutrition and health improvements, greater levels of education to the increasingly abstract nature of human existence. In James Flynn's book <em>What Is Intelligence?: Beyond the Flynn Effect</em>, he decomposes the gains in IQ found for American children in the Weschsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and finds that much of the gains have come from tests of abstract thinking (similarities test and Raven's progressive matrices). Only a small portion of the gains is due to improvements in information, arithmetic and vocabulary. This observation would support the idea that increases in IQ have been driven by the changing way in which we live.</p>

<h3>Alexander Luria's Studies of Reasoning</h3>
<p>Alexander Luria, a Russian neuropsychologist, conducted a series of interviews with headmen of villages in rural 1920s Russia as part of a study of reasoning. His research was published in a book titled <em>Cognitive Development: Its Cultural and Social Foundations</em> in 1976. The following extract from James Flynn's <em>What is intelligence?</em> is just one example of the types of responses Luria received from the villagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we have no difficulty freeing logic from concrete referents and reasoning about purely hypothetical situations. People were not always thus. Christopher Hallpike (1979) and Nick Mackintosh (2006) have drawn my attention to the seminal book on the social foundations of cognitive development by Luria (1976). His interviews with peasants in remote areas of the Soviet Union offer some wonderful examples. The dialogues paraphrased run as follows:</p>
<p>White bears and Novaya Zemlya (pp. 108-109):</p>
<p>Q: All bears are white where there is always snow; in Zovaya Zemlya there is always snow; what color are the bears there?<br />
A: I have seen only black bears and I do not talk of what I have not seen.<br />
Q: But what do my words imply?<br />
A: If a person has not been there he can not say anything on the basis of words. If a man was 60 or 80 and had seen a white bear there and told me about it, he could be believed.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Population Aging and The Flynn Effect</h3>
<p>The effect of an aging population, especially in advanced economies, has an attenuating effect on average cognitive abilities over time. Skirbekk et al. writing in <em>Intelligence</em> create projections of future cognitive abilities and find that if the Flynn effect reaches a saturation point, then average cognitive ability declines into the future. However, if the current Flynn effect persists, average intelligence will continue to rise in spite of an aging population. Consider the following simulations.</p>

<h3>Disease Burden and IQ</h3>
<p>Disease during pregnancy or early childhood can impair the cognitive development of children permanently. The driving force behind this theory is that if a child becomes seriously ill, the body transfers resources (energy) into fighting off the infection, reducing the amount left for brain development.</p>

<h3>Nutrition and Prosperity: Evidence from Aberdeen</h3>
<p>An examination of the differences in IQ between two cohorts, one group born in 1921 and the other 15 years apart in 1936, finds substantial differences in IQ over their lifetimes. The study conducted by Staff et al. uses panel (longitudinal) data on the same groups of individuals.[ref] R.T. Staff, M.J. Hogan, L.J. Whalley, Aging trajectories of fluid intelligence in late life: The influence of age, practice and childhood IQ on Raven's Progressive Matrices, <em>Intelligence</em>, Volume 47, November‚ÄìDecember 2014, Pages 194-201, ISSN 0160-2896. Available online <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.09.013" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] All students born in either 1921 or 1936 and attending school in Scotland on June 1, 1932 or June 4, 1947 were made to sit intelligence examinations. The authors report that scores on the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test decreases annually by over one-half point. At age 77 (where there is an overlap in data) there is an estimated difference of 16.5 IQ points between the two cohorts, which is roughly three times larger than expected.</p>
<p>Dr Roger Staff explains that "those born in 1936 were children during the war and experienced food rationing. Although rationing meant that the food was not particularly appetising it was nutritious and probably superior to the older group. In addition, post-war political changes such as the introduction of the welfare state and a greater emphasis on education probably ensured better health and greater opportunities. Finally, in their thirties and forties the 1936 group experienced the oil boom which brought them and the city prosperity. Taken together, good nutrition, education and occupational opportunities have resulted in this life long improvement in their intelligence. Aberdeen has been good for their IQ!"

<h3>Genetics and Intelligence</h3>
<p>The influence of genetics in determining intelligence is both an immensely important and controversial question. The main reason for the controversy surrounding this question is the connection between race, genetics and intelligence, as well as the policy implications for development and equality. Whilst there exists a broad consensus that intelligence is jointly pinned down by genetics and environmental factors, the precise mixture is uncertain.</p>
<p>In 1994 Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray published <em>The Bell Curve</em>, a highly controversial book on intelligence that explored the race gap in IQ that exists in the United States. The authors' belief that IQ is mostly inherited leads them to the following policy recommendations to prevent a decline in national intelligence:</p>
<ul>
<li>The US government should eliminate any welfare incentives for poor (low-IQ) women to have children, since richer (high-IQ) couples have less children.</li>
<li>Funding for educational programmes aimed at raising the achievement of poor and disadvantaged students should be stopped.</li>
<li>Reducing immigration into the US.</li>
<li>The removal of affirmative action programmes as under-representation of particular racial groups is a reflection of ability and intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major flaws in the research of Hernstein and Murray rest with their assertions about intelligence, in particular, that intelligence is mostly inherited and therefore invariant to time and environment. This central belief would generate a causal relationship between IQ and socioeconomic indicators such as high school dropout, incarceration, and poverty.[ref]If socioeconomic factors influence intelligence, then their empirical research design would be deeply flawed.[/ref] Research looking into the effects of environment on intelligence expose serious short-comings in the arguments and conclusions of <em>The Bell Curve</em>. Turkheimer et al. (2003) find that the relative importance of genetics and environment in the IQ of genetically identical twins is linked to socioeconomic status.[ref]Turkheimer, Eric, Andreana Haley, Mary Waldron, Brian D'Onofrio, and Irving I. Gottesman. "Socioeconomic status modifies heritability of IQ in young children." <em>Psychological science</em> 14, no. 6 (2003): 623-628. Available online <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/14/6/623.full" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] They report that "in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse."</p>
<h3>Global Differences in IQ</h3>
<p>International comparisons of IQ measures reveal large disparities between developed and developing countries. Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen's controversial research explores this area.[ref]Lynn, Richard, and Tatu Vanhanen. <em>IQ and the wealth of nations</em>. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002.</p>
<p>Lynn, Richard, and Tatu Vanhanen. <em>IQ and global inequality</em>. Washington Summit Publishers, 2006.[/ref] Lynn and Vanhanen subscribe to the view that IQ is mainly inherited and argue that the lower IQ of these nations is what holds back development. To support this claim they make use of the correlations between standard of living measures and IQ. This conclusion rests on the direction of causality; if low economic development has held back the Flynn effect and prevented intelligence growth, the results of the study are flawed.</p>
<p><a href="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_average-iq-by-country-v2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5780 size-large" src="http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_average-iq-by-country-v2-750x455.png" alt="" width="750" height="455" /></a></p>
<p>The methodology of their research has been heavily criticized for not having consistent measures of IQ across countries and for the way estimates were generated. For example, the average IQ of countries without data is reported as the average of neighboring or comparable countries. In addition to this, the way in which samples were either included or excluded in their analysis is unsystematic, potentially biasing their results. Thomas Nechyba's review in the <em>Journal of Economic Literature</em> points out the following flaw:[ref]Thomas J. Nechyba, 2004. "Book Reviews ." <em>Journal of Economic Literature</em>, 42(1): 220-221. DOI: 10.1257/002205104773558083. Available online <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jel.42.1" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]</p>
<blockquote><p>The degree of IQ heritability, however, has no logical bearing on this issue. Even if we take the authors‚Äô reading of the literature as given and assume that 80 percent of IQ is heritable, the entire observed cross country difference in IQ may be environmentally rather than genetically¬†driven. Consider, for instance, a plant variety whose size is known to be 80 percent heritable. If we grow genetically identical seeds of this plant in two plots under the same initial soil conditions and then fertilize only one plot, the dramatic differences in plant height that emerge will be entirely driven by environmental factors despite the high heritability of plant height. The fact that some countries score lower on IQ tests than others thus has nothing to say about the degree to which IQ scores are genetically predetermined or the degree to which they will change under different circumstances. Developed countries may simply be like the plants that received fertilizer earlier for reasons having nothing to do with IQ.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>The Success of Vaccinations</h3>
The¬†rotavirus is the most common cause of diarrhea and causes 527,000 childhood deaths annually (2011). Many more become sick¬†and are hospitalized.[ref]Both the¬†<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus">virus</a>¬†and the¬†<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotavirus_vaccine">vaccine</a>¬†are described in Wikipedia[/ref]¬†Mexico¬†introduced the rotavirus vaccination between¬†2006 and 2007, and the following graph shows how¬†successful¬†the countrywide vaccination was. According to the study, diarrhea mortality for children under the age of 5 fell by 56% over three years! The graph shows the seasonal pattern of the disease and how the lifesaving effect of the vaccine affected different age groups.

<h4>The reduction of disease in the USA</h4>
Just like the children in Mexico, people in richer countries continue to benefit from the application of vaccinations. But the benefits might possibly be forgotten as the diseases have lost their threat after¬†the introduction of the vaccines. To see how we are benefitting from vaccinations it is necessary to compare the suffering before and after the introduction of the vaccine. This is what Roush and Murphy did for the US, and I have visualized the reduction in mortality for vaccine-preventable diseases in the following graph (and also reprinted a table with more results just below the graph). The graph shows that the reduction in mortality is mostly 100% across multiple vaccine-preventable diseases.

<h3>Vaccination Coverage</h3>

<h3>The global decline of measles</h3>
The following chart shows the number of reported cases of measles in the United States from 1980 to 2014. You can add more countries to the chart for comparison. The extremely large outbreak in 1990 in the United States was primarily caused by low vaccination coverage, and lead to a renewed push for vaccination and for the recommendation of a second dose in children. In 2008, there were 140 measles cases in the US, which was the highest annual total since 1996. These cases were caused by¬†increased measles transmission due to unvaccinated children[ref]Centers for Disease Control, Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html">Ch. 13 Measles</a>[/ref]. In 2014, 610 cases of measles were reported[ref]<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html">Measles Cases and Outbreaks</a>, Centers for Disease Control[/ref]. This recent increase in the number of measles cases demonstrates the importance of vaccination.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
The 1990s saw a substantial increase in the number of people infected with HIV and dying of AIDS. In 1997, almost 3.5 million people were diagnosed with HIV per year. After 1997, the number of new diagnoses began to decline and in 2015 it was reduced to 2.1 million per year.

The number of AIDS-related deaths increased throughout the 1990s and reached a peak in 2004, 2005 when in both years 2 million people died. Since then the annual number of deaths from AIDS declined as well and a decade later it was almost halved when 1.1 million people died in 2015.

The chart also shows the continuing increase in the number of people living with HIV. The rate of increase has slowed down compared to the 1990s but the absolute number reached a peak in 2015 when 36.7 million people were living with HIV globally.

<h3>New Infections</h3>
There are 700,000 fewer new HIV infections across the world in 2011 than in 2001.[ref]See UNAIDS (2012) ‚Äì 2012 UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report - Results. Online <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/publications/2012/name,76120,en.asp">here</a>.[/ref] However, the distribution of these new cases is not even across different regions in low and middle income countries. In most regions of the world, the number of new infections has decreased or stayed fairly steady since 2001. However, the number of new HIV infections has actually increased in the Middle East and North Africa. But still the number of new cases in the Middle East is still much lower than in most other regions: the Middle East sees approximately 25,000 new HIV infections per year, while Sub-Saharan Africa still has approximately 1,500,000 new infections per year. Fortunately, the number of new cases in Sub-Sarharan Africa is steadily decreasing each year.

The following chart further shows how the reduction in the number of new HIV infections varies across country. As the chart states, 25 countries have seen over a 50% reduction in new HIV infections in adults between 2001 and 2011. Some countries have seen massive decreases, like Nepal, which has had a 91% reduction in new adult HIV cases. Others have seen a smaller difference, like Mexico with a 29% reduction.

<h3>Deaths from AIDS</h3>
As the chart below states, death from AIDS began to decline in the mid-2000s because of increased antiretroviral treatment and the reduction in HIV incidence.¬†The death rate has decreased at very different rates in different countries.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants, &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Antiretroviral Medicine</h3>
Below, we can see how the increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) corresponds with the decrease in AIDS-related deaths. As ART use increased, AIDS-related deaths began to slow and decrease.
<h6>AIDS related deaths and number of people receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) ‚Äì¬†The Economist[ref]</h6>

The following graphs show what a profound effect ART has on the number of AIDS-related deaths.¬†In most regions, the number of people who died while using ART peaked in the mid-2000s and then began to decline, while the number of people who died without ART has continued to increase or remain fairly steady. The Middle East and North Africa region is a notable exception to this trend, where ART has made a difference in the number of deaths, but not a profound one.

The chart below shows the number of people receiving ART in different global regions. The number of people on ART has increased since 2002, and a large portion of that global increase is due to the increase in Sub-Saharan Africa.

<h3>Resources Available to Spend on AIDS</h3>
The following chart shows international and domestic spending on ART in various low and middle income countries. Previously, we have seen that AIDs deaths are still steadily increasing in the Middle East and North Africa, which may partially be due to the lack of domestic resources placed on ART therapy in this region.

Increases in education lead to safer behaviors. In both Kenya and the Dominican Republic, higher education level is correlated with higher condom usage. Even having only part of a primary education leads to a massive increase in the percentage of people who know that condoms prevent the spread of HIV.

<h3>Mother to Child Infection</h3>
Mother to child transmission of HIV is one of the leading causes of HIV spread. Fortunately, in all Sub-Saharan African regions, mother-to-child transmission has decreased. For Eastern and Southern Africa, the decrease has been dramatic, while Western and Central Africa have see periods of increased transmission, though the percentage is still lower than it was in 2003.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
According to the Wikipedia page on HIV/AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that leads to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition that progressively compromises the immune system. It is transmitted through "unprotected sexual intercourse, contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding."[ref]See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS">Wikipedia page on HIV/AIDS</a>.[/ref]

<h3>Land Use Change in the Very Long Run</h3>
<p>Navin Ramankutty and Jonathan A. Foley have reconstructed the change in global agricultural land usage. In their very highly cited (&gt;800 times) publication, Ramankutty and Foley (1999) have reconstructed the change between 1700 and 1992. In the equally famous update, Ramankutty et al. (2008) have¬†presented estimates on global agricultural lands in the year 2000.[ref]The mentioned publications are:<br />

<p>The following graph includes a projection of global arable land for the period 2010-2060. While the authors of this paper forecast a slight decline of global farmland, the before-cited research by the FAO projects a slight increase of total global farmland.</p>
<p>Ausubel, Wernick, &amp; Waggoner (2013) argue that 'peak farm' is already a reality, saying 'while the ratio of arable land per unit of crop production shows improved efficiency of land use, the number of hectares of cropland has scarcely changed since 1990. Absent the 3.4 percent of arable land devoted to energy crops (Trostle 2008), absolute declines would have begun during the last decade.'[ref]This quote is taken from Jesse H. Ausubel, Iddo K.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<p>The following graph shows that to produce an equivalent aggregate of crop production (PIN) in 2012 required only about 32% of the land needed in 1961. The agricultural production index (PIN) is the sum of agricultural commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices. The FAO explains the construction of the PIN in detail <a href="http://faostat.fao.org/site/362/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=362">here</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for this chart is taken from Ausubel, Wernick, and Waggoner (2013).[ref]Jesse H. Ausubel, Iddo K. Wernick, Paul E. Waggoner (2013) ‚Äì¬†Peak Farmland and the Prospect for Land Sparing.

Online <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2013.00561.x/abstract">here</a>.[/ref] The authors write: <em>'A combination of agricultural technologies raised yields, keeping downward pressure on the extent of cropland, sparing land for nature.</em><br />
<em> Countering the global rise of population and affluence by parents and workers, consumers and farmers restrained the expansion of arable land by changing tastes and lifting yields. The noticeable shrinkage in the extent of cropland as a function of the Crop Production index since 1990 (Figure below) provides encouragement that farmers will continue sparing land.'</em></p>

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<p>The Land Area of the World is 13,003 million ha. 4,889 million ha are classified as 'agricultural area' by the FAO (this is 37.6% of the Land Area).<br />
The agricultural area use is divided into 3 categories: arable land (28% of the global agricultural area), permanent crops (3%) and permanent meadows and pastures (69%) which account for the largest share of the world's agricultural area.[ref]These numbers are taken from FAO (2013) ‚Äì Statistical Yearbook. Table 4. Online <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3107e/i3107e.PDF">here</a>.</p>
<p>For comparison: The area of the USA, Canada and China are all short of 1,000 million ha (USA 963 million ha, China 932 million ha, Canada 909 million ha).[/ref]</p>
<p>What do these words mean?</p>
<p>The <strong>agricultural area</strong> is the sum of arable land, permanent crops, permanent meadows and pastures.</p>
<p>The FAO definition for <strong>arable land</strong> is land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for ‚ÄúArable land‚Äù are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable.'[ref]This is the definition given by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in their glossary that is online <a href="http://faostat.fao.org/site/375/default.aspx">here</a>. [/ref]</p>
<p>The same source defines <strong>permanent crops </strong>as follows: 'Permanent crops are divided into temporary and permanent crops. Permanent crops are sown or planted once, and then occupy the land for some years and need not be replanted after each annual harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and rubber. This category includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes trees grown for wood or timber.<br />
And again from the same source the definition for <em>permanent meadows and pastures </em>is 'land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops, either cultivated or growing wild (wild prairie or grazing land).'</p>
<p>The FAO definition for <strong>f</strong><strong>allow land</strong> is 'the cultivated land that is not seeded for one or more growing seasons. The maximum idle period is usually less than five years.'</p>

Mortality by age refers to age-specific mortality rates; in other words, how much longer you are expected to live given you have already reached a particular age. As with life expectancy, age-specific life expectancy has increased dramatically in the past couple of centuries.

(The Human Mortality Database data refers to remaining life expectancy for people in a 5 year age bracket (10-14, 15-19, ...). To calculate total life expectancy I have added the lower bound of each range to the remaining life expectancy for the given age group ‚Äì the values here should therefore be understood as the lower bound for total life expectancy.)[/ref]

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<p>The definition for 'crop yield' given by the FAO is 'Harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most of the cases yield data are not recorded but obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested. Data on yields of permanent crops are not as reliable as those for temporary crops either because most of the area information may correspond to planted area, as for grapes, or because of the scarcity and unreliability of the area figures reported by the countries, as for example for cocoa and coffee.'[ref]This is the definition given by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in their glossary that is online <a href="http://faostat.fao.org/site/375/default.aspx">here</a>.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
Before the onset of modernity, every fourth child died before its first birthday. Over the course of modernity, the mortality of infants (children below 1 years of age) declined rapidly ‚Äì first in the countries that industrialized early and now in countries around the world. This is shown in the following time series plot. It's also interesting to note now infant mortality around the world seemed to vary a lot year to year, but since the 1960s, the decline has become much steadier.

Country averages of infant mortality¬†sometimes obscure the variation in infant mortality between regions within the country.¬†Storeygard, Balk, Levy and Deane (2008) assembled a data-set that looks at the sub-national distribution of infant mortality.[ref]Adam Storeygard, Deborah Balk, Marc Levy and Glenn Deane (2008) ‚Äì The global distribution of infant mortality: a subnational spatial view. Population, Space and Place, Volume 14, Issue 3, pages 209‚Äì229, May/June 2008. Online <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp.484/abstract">here</a>.[/ref]¬†The data set covers over 10,000 national and subnational units worldwide. It is benchmarked to the year 2000. Understandably, many of the countries with the highest national infant mortality averages have lots of subnational variation in these rates, but even some of the most highly developed nations still see massive variation in infant mortality at the regional level. The most extreme example is China, which experiences an infant mortality rate near 0 in some regions but a rate around 325 at the other extreme.

<h3>Mortality Inequality</h3>
Sam Peltzman analyzes the inequality of life expectancy over time and between nations[ref]Sam Peltzman,¬†‚ÄúMortality Inequality‚Äù, Journal of Economic Perspectives 23(4), Fall 2009: 175-19. Online <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.23.4.175">here</a>. [/ref]. Instead of using a Gini coefficient for income[ref]See the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">data quality and definitions section of the income inequality page</a> for more information about the Gini coefficient for income.[/ref], he applies the same concept to years of life, resulting in a Gini coefficient for mortality. From the graph ‚Äì that shows his data ‚Äì we can see that life expectancy inequality fell in countries around the world. Notably the United States still experiences higher mortality inequality than many of its¬†similarly-developed counterparts.

Peltzman notes, that 'the changes in life expectancy represent not only a gain in welfare, by extending life on average, but have also contributed greatly to social equality. Indeed, the numerical decline in mortality Ginis seems to have exceeded the decline of income Ginis in the last century or so, and this might hint at a larger contribution to social equality from improved longevity than from income redistribution.'

<h3>Life expectancy by age in the UK</h3>
We can see health inequality has decreased massively over the last 150 years or so from the following chart. Life expectancy¬†differed massively between ages¬†in 1845 ‚Äì from 40 years for newborns to 79 for 70-year olds. Today the difference in life expectancies between these age groups¬†is much smaller; Newborns can expect to live until age 81 to, and 70-year olds to age 86. This is because the chance of dying at a younger age has been steadily decreasing, which means that the¬†equality of life expectancy across ages has increased.
<h6>Total life expectancy in the UK by age, 1541-2001 ‚Äì Max Roser[ref]</h6>
The visualization shows the total life expectancy since birth and not the remaining life expectancy.

&nbsp;

The data for life expectancy by age is taken from the Human Mortality Database.¬† University of California, Berkeley (USA), and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany). Available at <a href="http://www.mortality.org">www.mortality.org</a> (data downloaded on 11 February 2014).

The data on life expectancy at birth before 1845 is taken the data from Kertzer and Laslett (1995) - see below. Their sources are the 'British official statistics' and Wrigley and Schofield [1981] 1989.
Kertzer and Laslett (eds) (1995) - Aging in the Past: Demography, Society, and Old Age. Berkeley:¬† University of California Press. Online <a href="http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft096n99tf/ ">here</a>.

&nbsp;

(The Human Mortality Database data refers to remaining life expectancy for people in a 5 year age bracket (10-14, 15-19, ...). To calculate total life expectancy I have added the lower bound of each range to the remaining life expectancy for the given age group ‚Äì the values here should therefore be understood as the lower bound for total life expectancy.)[/ref]

<h3>Inequality by socio-economic class</h3>
In absolute terms the inequality of life expectancy has decreased massively; nevertheless it still remains significant in relative terms. When considering how the inequality of child mortality has decreased, one has to take into account that the occupational structure has also changed ‚Äì the share of people employed in the low-skilled sector has decreased. The authors of the data below ‚Äì Floud, Fogel, Harris, Hong ‚Äì add that the "differences are still apparent even after allowances have been made for the effects of changes in the occupational structure of the British population and selection effect".[ref]For the source see the next citation.[/ref]

We can see below that the gap in infant mortality has narrowed significantly in absolute terms; there were 80 infant deaths per 1000 live births for infants with fathers who were in unskilled manual fields, versus 32 deaths per 1000 live births born to fathers with professional careers, representing a¬†2.5 times lower rate. Today, those absolute mortality numbers are only 7.4 and 3.8 respectively, but there is still nearly a two-fold difference in mortality rate.

Not only is¬†lower socioeconomic status (SES) associated with shorter life span, but it is also correlated with higher disease prevalence. Cox et al (2006) found multiple studies using various measures of¬†SES that predominantly¬†pointed to higher rates of incidence and mortality of stroke in lower SES categories.[ref]Anna M Cox, Christopher McKevitt, Anthony G Rudd, Charles DA Wolfe, Socioeconomic status and stroke, The Lancet Neurology, Volume 5, Issue 2, February 2006, Pages 181-188.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
As intuition would suggest, the healthcare system¬†of a society affects the health of that society. There is much debate about what the best system is. One study from Gruber et al (2014) analyzes a 2001 healthcare reform in Thailand called "30 Baht". The program increased funding to hospitals to care for the poor and decreased copays to 30 Baht, which is approximately $0.75 USD. The study suggests that the program increased healthcare utilization especially among the poorest, and infant mortality was significantly reduced. After the implementation of 30 Baht, the correlation between the wealth of the Thai province and infant mortality reduced to nearly 0.¬†[ref]Gruber, Jonathan, Nathaniel Hendren, and Robert M.

These skills are increasingly necessary for life in the modern world, and are essential to the functioning of developed economies. For this reason, primary education is compulsory and provided by the state in almost all countries around the world. The second United Nations Millennium Development Goal was to "ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling." This goal was missed but significant progress has been made. In 1999, only 81% of children in the developing world attending primary school, and today the figure is around 92% -- equivalent to 58 million children not in primary education.[ref]World Bank, Millennium Development Goals. Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education by 2015 (<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/education.html" target="_blank">link</a>).</p>

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<p>Historically, formal education was propagated by religious institutions as a way of spreading and preserving their traditions as well as training clergy. Although schools and religious institutions existed long before the 19th century, education was not compulsory and, in the majority of cases, costly. What is more, the value of a child's labour meant that only the richest families could afford to educate their children, a phenomenon that still exists in many developing countries today.</p>
<p><!-- ____________________________________________________________ --></p>
<h3>The Rise of Basic Schooling since the 19th Century</h3>
<p>The earliest universal primary education system was established in Prussia by Frederick William in 1717.[ref] <em>Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online</em>, s. v. "Frederick William I", accessed July 23, 2015, <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-William-I" target="_blank">http://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-William-I</a>[/ref] It was greatly expanded during the first half of the 19th Century and later copied by other European nations and the US. While many countries followed suit during the 20th century, others have been much slower at adopting the model of universal education. India only passed laws introducing universal, free and compulsory education in 2009. There also still remain a handful countries that do not have laws making attendance mandatory.</p>

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>Primary Education and Growth</h3>
<p>The correlation between schooling and growth¬†has long been recognised. Countries with higher rates of education also tend to be more developed economies. For more information on the link between education and development, click <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/global-rise-of-education/#correlates-determinants-consequences" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Richard Easterlin writing in 1981 highlighted the importance of universal schooling and economic development.[ref]Easterlin, Richard A. "Why isn't the whole world developed?." <em>The Journal of Economic History</em> 41, no. 01 (1981): 1-17. Available online <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0022050700042674" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] His argument rests on the observation that "in the United States and Germany [the] development of widespread formal schooling preceded the onset of modern economic growth." Furthermore, Easterlin argues that mass (primary) schooling of a "secular and rationalistic type" is the most conducive to economic growth and not simply just education of the elite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Raising productivity levels involves active participation in new production methods by large numbers of the population‚Äîby workers in agriculture, industry, transportation, and so on. This is not to say that secondary and higher education can be ignored; clearly one needs technologists as well as mass education. But increases at higher levels of education typically go together with the expansion of primary education. On the other hand, education of the elite without mass education is unlikely to foster economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Easterlin suggests that the focus on educating the elite at the expense of the masses in the Ottoman Empire may have contributed to its decline. He also points out that while Spain had relatively high levels of primary education, it was tightly controlled by the Catholic Church and did not teach science, mathematics or other subjects that constitute a modern elementary education. For this reason, by 1900 almost two-thirds of Spain's population remained illiterate.<br />

<h3>Religion, Schooling and Growth</h3>
<p>The debate surrounding the link between religion and growth has an interesting history. Max Weber writing in the early 20th Century argued that it was the protestant work ethic that fostered the spirit of capitalism. However, recent empirical tests of this theory have rejected it.</p>
<p>Sascha O. Becker and Ludger Woessmann conducted an empirical test of Weber's hypothesis in Prussia.[ref]Becker, Sascha O., and Ludger Woessmann. "Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History." <em>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> 124, no. 2 (2009): 531-596. Available online <a href="http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/124/2/531.short" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] They conclude that while economic performance was indeed higher in protestant regions, so too was literacy, which explains the gap in economic performance. In particular, "protestant economies prospered because instruction in reading the Bible generated the human capital crucial to economic prosperity." For more information on literacy, click <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/literacy/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><!-- ____________________________________________________________ --></p>
<h3>Returns to Education</h3>
<p>Cross-country estimates of the return to education have found that the highest returns come from primary schooling. The most comprehensive work by George Psacharopoulos finds that the rate of return on primary education to an individual is 26.6%, highlighting the enormous benefits of basic education.[ref]Psacharopoulos, George, and Harry Anthony Patrinos*. "Returns to investment in education: a further update." <em>Education economics</em> 12, no. 2 (2004): 111-134. Available online <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0964529042000239140" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] However, disaggregating the results reveals that for less developed countries this is broadly true, but that in the developed world, the returns to higher education tend to be greater than for primary education.[ref]For a detailed analysis for the UK economy see:</p>
<p>Blundell, Richard, Lorraine Dearden, Costas Meghir, and Barbara Sianesi. "Human capital investment: the returns from education and training to the individual, the firm and the economy." Fiscal studies 20, no. 1 (1999): 1-23. Available online <a href="http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/2225" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] This pattern could be explained by the heterogeneous labour market conditions around the world, in particular, the supply of skilled and unskilled labour.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<h3>Enrollment definitions</h3>
<p>There exist several ways of measuring enrollment in school:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net Enrollment Ratio (NER)</strong>: is the ratio of enrolled children in the official school age group to the total number of children in the official school age group</li>
<li><strong>Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER)</strong>: is the ratio of¬†enrolled children of all ages to the total number of children in the official school age group</li>
</ul>
<p>In countries where many children enter school later (or repeat grades) the GER can exceed 100%, whereas the NER cannot exceed 100%.</p>

In this section we will look at this more recent time and will also study the inequality between different regions - both in respect to the unequal levels of prosperity today and the unequal economic starting points for leaving the poverty of the pre-growth past.</p>
<p>Economic prosperity is measured as via growth domestic product (GDP) per capita, the the value of all goods and services produced by a country in one year divided by the country‚Äôs population. Economic growth is the measure of the change of GDP¬†from one year to the next. This entry shows that the current experience of economic growth is an absolute exception in the very long-run perspective of social history.</p>
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>GDP per Capita Growth around the World Since the Year 1 CE</h3>
<p>There are many reconstructions of GDP per capita over the last centuries; here I will focus on the reconstructions by the British economist Angus Maddison who was working in Groningen (Netherlands) and where, after his death in 2010, younger colleagues are advancing his work in the 'Maddison Project'.[ref]This data is available at the <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm">website</a> of the Maddison Project. The data constructed by Maddison himself is also available online at his personal <a href="http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/oriindex.htm">website</a>.[/ref]</p>
<p>The following graph shows Maddison's reconstructions for eight major world regions.</p>

<p>Maddison's data confirms what he have learned from the very long-run perspective before: before the onset of modern economic growth, every region in the world was extremely¬†poor. But there are also important insights gained from Maddison's data: The starting points of economic growth are very different from region to region. Until the year 1000, everyone was equally poor but we learn that as early as the year 1500 Western Europe had achieved some very limited economic prosperity; until the early 19th century the region could slowly increase the economic wealth. But the wealth enjoyed at the time is still incomparably low with the level that Europe enjoys now at the beginning of the 21st century. Starting from 772 Int. $ in 1500, it doubled until 1820 but since¬†has¬†increased more than 12-fold![ref]According to Maddison's data Western European GDP per capita was 772 Int. $ in 1500, 1572 Int. $ in 1820 and 19912 Int. $ in 2003.[/ref]</p>
<p>In 1700 the 'Western Offshoots' of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US were as poor as any region except Western Europe. But although they had a later start leaving poverty¬†behind, they caught up quickly with Western Europe and surpassed it by 1900.</p>
<p>It is often the case that progress creates inequality between regions¬†because it is not happening equally as fast¬†everywhere, but if we compare the economic prosperity of every region in 2003 with any earlier time we see that every single region is richer than ever before in its history. Though some regions are more productive than others, every region is doing better than ever before - much better.</p>
<p>After looking back on more than a million years of world poverty the question arises: why did economic growth not happen before? Why were our ancestors kept in poverty for millennia after millennia? To answer this question it is helpful to look at just a single country.</p>

<h3>Over the Last Millennia until Now</h3>
<p>Data on economic growth is now routinely published by statistical offices, but researchers have had to reconstruct accounts of the economic productivity for the past. These reconstructions are arguably very uncertain. Nevertheless it is absolutely clear that compared to the prolonged growth of economic productivity in the last centuries, the productivity was always¬†very low before: The difference of prosperity is much¬†greater than the uncertainty of the exact values.</p>
<p>I have included one reconstruction of GDP per capita over the very long run:¬†the last 1,002,000 years. The economist J. Bradford DeLong has constructed the data that I have visualized in this interactive graph.</p>
<p>It is not easy to show more than 1 million years on the x-axis of a single graph when all the action happens in the very last couple of centuries. If I would have chosen to give each year the same space on the axis the graph would simply look like this: À© , practically a right angle.</p>
<p>For this reason I reverted to give years very unequal spacing - admittedly a not so precise way of showing this data either.</p>

<p>What we learn from this chart is that on average the people of the past were many times poorer than we are today. For all the thousands and thousands of years before 1800, the average GDP per capita was lower than just 200 Dollars (1990 International Dollars).[ref]The currency is explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary%E2%80%93Khamis_dollar">here</a>.[/ref] Prosperity is a very recent achievement that distinguishes the last 10 or 20 generations from all of their ancestors. In 2000, the average GDP was 6539$ - more than 30 times the average of the past.</p>
<h3>The Last 2000 Years</h3>
<p>From the data that we have discussed previously,¬†we know that with respect to economic growth all the action really just happened very recently. It is true that in the pre-growth era some people were very well off - but this was a very tiny elite, from tribal leaders to the pharaohs to kings and popes. Yet the average person was very much worse off in these unequal societies.</p>
<p>The destitution of the common man only changed with the onset of economic growth. The time when this change happened is depicted in the following graph - this time again on a regular time axis. From this it becomes clear that economic prosperity was only achieved over the course of the last millennium - really just over the last couple of hundred years. In fact, it was mostly achieved over the second half of the last hundred years.</p>

<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>Global divergence followed by convergence ‚Äì Economic history in one chart</h3>
This chart shows the distribution of the annual income between all world citizen. To make incomes comparable across countries and across time the annual incomes are measured in International Dollars ‚Äì this is a currency that would would buy a comparable amount of goods and services a U.S. dollar would buy in the United States in 1990.

The distribution of incomes is shown at 3 points in time:
<ul>
 	<li>In 1820 only few countries achieved economic growth. The chart shows that the majority of the world lived in poverty with an income similar to the poorest countries in Africa today (around 500 International Dollars). The <a title="World Poverty" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/">data entry on global poverty</a> shows that in 1820 between 85% and 95% of the world lived in absolute poverty.</li>
 	<li>In the year 1950, 150 years later, the world has changed ‚Äì it became very unequal. The world income distribution has become bimodal. It has the shape of a camel. One hump at around 500 International Dollars and a second hump at around 5,000 International Dollars ‚Äì the world was divided into a poor developing world and a 10-times richer developed world.</li>
 	<li>Over the following 3 decades the world income distribution has again changed dramatically. The poorer countries, especially in South-East Asia, have caught up. The two-humped camel shaped has changed into a one-humped dromedar shape. World income inequality has declined. And not only is the world more equal again, the distribution has also shifted to the right ‚Äì the world is much richer.</li>

<h3>Global income inequality increased for 2 centuries and is now falling</h3>
The visualization below shows the distribution of incomes between 1988 and 2011. The data was compiled by the economists Branko Milanovic and Christoph Lakner.[ref]The data was made to Our World In Data by the two authors. The data up to 2008 is published with the main publication Milanovic and Lakner (2015) ‚ÄìGlobal Income Distribution. Available online at the World Bank: <a href="http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-6719">http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-6719</a>.[/ref]
To see the change over time select the years just above the distribution.
The previous visualization that showed the the change from the year 1820 to the year 2000 is based on estimates of inflation-adjusted average incomes per country (GDP per capita) and a measure of income inequality within a country only. It gives us a rough idea of how the distribution of incomes changed, but it is not very detailed and not very precise. In contrast to this the work by Branko Milanovic and Christoph Lakner is based on much more detailed household survey data. This data is measuring household income at each decile of the income distribution and the two authors used this information to arrive at the global income distribution. The downside of this approach is that we can only go as far back in time as household surveys were conducted.
The visualization shows the end of the long era in human history in which global inequality was increasing. Starting with the industrialization in North-Western Europe incomes in this part of the world started to increase while material prosperity in the rest of the world remained low. While some countries followed the European industrialization ‚Äì first Northern America, Oceania, and parts of South America and later Japan and East Asia ‚Äì other countries in Asia and Africa remained poor. As a consequence of this global inequality increased over a long period of time. Only in the period shown in the visualization below did this change: With rapid growth in much of Asia in particular did the global distribution of incomes become less unequal. The incomes of the poorer half of the world population rose faster than the incomes of the richer half of the world population.

Before the publication of the previously shown paper, the economists Sudhir Anand and Paul Segal reviewed the research literature on the distribution of global income inequality. In this very thorough study, that is still interesting and very relevant, the author found 'no consensus regarding the direction of change' showing that 'findings of a rise or fall in global income inequality are not robust across different estimation methods and datasets'.[ref]The research paper is Anand, Sudhir, and Paul Segal. 2008.

The development of universities, and higher education more generally, over the course of the last millennium is closely tied to religion. Universities were established as organisations free from direct control of the church or other religious institutions, a privilege usually granted by the king or state. This privilege allowed for academic freedom to question, research and advance knowledge. Religious studies remained an important focus in most early medieval universities. In the modern world universities have two purposes: equip students with advanced skills useful in the workplace and to further human knowledge and understanding of the world.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>

This section covers both the historical perspective on higher education as well as recent trends and future projections.

<h3>The Historical Perspective: Religion and Higher Education</h3>

In the past, there were very few higher education institutions since only a <a title="Literacy" href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/literacy/">small fraction of the population was able to read or write</a>. During this early period, centers of education mostly had a religious focus and trained clergy. In Western Europe these centers were monasteries, while in the Islamic world these were madrasas. The following table shows the increasing number of monasteries in Western Europe¬†between the 6th and the 15th century.

<h4>The Secularization of Higher Education in Europe</h4>


The number of all monasteries in Western Europe is displayed below. Between the end of the first millennium and the 13th century the number grew¬†rapidly, before coming to a halt and declining.

At the same time evolved¬†a new form of a higher education¬†institution: the university. These secular institutions began to rise as monasteries slowly started to decline, and the religious powers lost their monopoly on higher education. Still, this was only the beginning; as late as the 18th century there were still fewer¬†than 100 universities in Western Europe.

<p>The following table paints a more detailed picture of the early rise of universities in Western Europe. By clicking on the top row, you can sort the cells and track the shift of higher learning from the mediterranean countries to the North. In the 15th century, there were 17 universities in Italy and 9 in the Iberian countries. Thereafter there were no new universities in these two regions,¬†and only one new institution in France. But in the northern countries - especially in Germany and Central Europe - the rise of universities intensified and more universities were founded as time went on.</p>

Note by the original author: Prices through 2007 are marketing year averages. The 1866‚Äì1908 wheat prices are weighted by production; the 1909‚Äì2007 prices are weighted by sales. The 2008 wheat and corn prices are the November 2008 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) season average, mid-point of range. Due to lack of another consistent deÔ¨Çator, prices deÔ¨Çated by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calendar year Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers.

The FAO Food Price Index (FPI) is a measure of the international prices of food (e.g., between suppliers or nations), while the food consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the price of food to the actual consumer. The following graphs show that "the FPI translate to higher consumer prices only to a very limited degree and with a time lag of a few months." The lag is often due to the time needed to harvest, transport and process food to the consumer. The limited relationship in the magnitude of the two indices "is explained by a combination of factors that determine vertical price transmission in every food economy, including mark-ups for transportation, processing and marketing, and by any subsidies at the consumer level."[ref]The source is FAO, IFAD &amp; WFP (2013) ‚Äì¬†The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013 - The multiple dimensions of food security, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) or of the World Food Programme (WFP), FAO, Rome, 2013.

If we consider the process of wage determination in the labour market, we can understand the skill premium through the lens of demand and supply. As an economy develops and new technologies emerge, the demand for skills changes. Meanwhile on the supply-side, we would expect that both the costs of, and returns to education influence an individual's human capital investment.</p>
<h2>¬†Empirical View</h2>
<h3>¬†Historical Perspective on the Skill Premium</h3>
<p>Historically, the most significant changes to the skill premium took place during the Black Death, the Industrial Revolution, the Machine Age and, most recently, the information technology revolution. The advent of new technologies can reduce the demand for unskilled labour, whose tasks can be performed by machines or automated, or skilled labour whose skills become obsolete. Although technological progress can displace labour, it tends to increase real wages as the price of goods fall.</p>
<p>The best available data on the historical skill premium suggests that the skill premium was very high before the Black Death. Jan Luiten van Zanden attributes this decline to a fall in interest rates after the Black Death caused by¬†the substantial drop in population levels altering the labour/land and labour/capital ratios.[ref]Van Zanden, Jan Luiten. "The skill premium and the ‚ÄòGreat Divergence‚Äô."¬†<em>European Review of Economic History</em> 13, no. 1 (2009): 121-153. Available online <a href="http://ereh.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/1/121.short" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] </p>
<p>Lower interest rates induced households to increase investment in human capital, and this increase in supply caused the observed fall in the skill premium. After the decline, we see remarkable stability in the skill premium through to the 19th-20th century. The skill premium for craftsmen (carpenters) relative to labourer's in construction remained stable at around 1.5 between the end of the Black Death and the end of the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>Note that the author defines skill premium here as "the difference between the wage of a skilled labourer (mostly a carpenter) and an unskilled labourer, divided by the wage of the unskilled labourer. For example, a skill premium of 100 means that the carpenter earns twice the wage of the unskilled labourer."</p>
<h3>Skill Premium in the USA Today</h3>
<p>In recent years the skill premium has been increasing in the US, especially for those with advanced degrees. Less educated workers in the US saw their real wages fall between 1980 and the present day. David Autor attributes this decline to three forces: technological change, de-unionisation, and globalisation.[ref]Autor, David H. "Skills, education, and the rise of earnings inequality among the" other 99 percent"." <em>Science</em> 344, no. 6186 (2014): 843-851. Available online <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6186/843.full" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] Technological change has eroded demand for blue-collar production and white-collar office, clerical and administrative support. The weakening of unions has reduced the bargaining power of workers, depressing their wages, while globalisation has brought increased competition from developing economies.

<p>We can see this pattern in the changing composition of the labour market. In the years 1979-2010 employment growth has declined in medium skill occupations, namely, sales, office/administration, production and operators/labourers. These occupations were also the hardest hit by the recession period of 2007-2010.</p>

<h3>Skill Premium in a Global Perspective</h3>
<p>There exist differences in the value of higher education by country. Much of this can be understood through the country-specific demand and supply factors. Nevertheless, the average skill premium for the OECD measured as the relative wages of those with a university degree relative to a high school education is around 1.5.</p>

<h3>University and Degree Inequality in the US</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the value of a degree is tied to the institution and specialisation. The precise effect the particular institution or specialisation has on earnings is difficult to estimate since universities are academically selective and student self-select into different degree programmes and careers. Computer science majors at Stanford can expect 20 year return on investment of $1,619,700, meanwhile some universities have a negative estimated return on investment.</p>

<h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2>
<h3>The Supply of Labour</h3>
<p>There is a strong association between the relative supply of skilled to unskilled workers and the skill premium. It should come as no surprise that an increase in the supply of skilled workers, all other things being equal, should depress the wages of skilled workers, and hence lower the skill premium. In the following chart the (log) change in relative supply and (log) change in relative wage of college graduates to high school graduates is plotted showing the inverse relationship.</p>

<p>The following scatter plot highlights this supply effect for the OECD economies. There is a clear negative correlation between the proportion of tertiary/university educated individuals and the skill premium of degree holders over high school graduates.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 660px; border: 0px none;" src="http://ourworldindata.org/chart-builder/public/view/53" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h3>Labour Demand and Technology</h3>
<p>Prior to the Industrial Revolution, consumer goods were primarily produced by skilled artisans. The advent of labour saving technologies in textile manufacture brought about by the Industrial Revolution in England threatened the livelihoods of skilled textile workers. The new technologies meant that the work of an artisan could be divided into smaller tasks and completed by unskilled labourers operating machines. Those opposed to these labour saving technologies became known as Luddites. In response to the increasing protests, Parliament introduced harsh penalties for the breaking of mechanised looms.[ref]The two acts of Parliament were: The Protection of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1788 and The Destruction of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1812.[/ref] Unskilled agricultural workers were also affected by the new technologies of the Industrial Revolution. The introduction of threshing machines significantly reduced the demand for labour and led to the Swing Riots of 1830 across England.</p>
<p>Over the last century technology has made more professions obsolete. Typists have been replaced by computers and printers and telegraphists were made obsolete by the internet. Nevertheless, protesting labour-saving technologies has persisted into the modern day. More recently, taxi drivers around the world have protested against the rise of Uber and other technologies that have disrupted their business models. In London, black cab drivers have to learn the Knowledge of London and pass famously difficult exams to obtain their licenses; modern GPS has made this intricate knowledge of London's streets redundant. Tube staff in London have strongly resisted the introduction of ticket machines and driverless trains.</p>

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2>
<p>In this section the skill premium is defined as the wage ratio of skilled to unskilled labour unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the long-run data presented on the skill premium is not directly comparable with the contemporary data. The historical data from Clark and van Zanden is primarily constructed from the wages of carpenters and labourers. For this reason, it is not possible to make more general statements about the skill premium that existed in other industries, or exactly what the returns to education were during this time.</p>

While expanding education and increasing access is important, the actual skills acquired by students in the classroom are arguably a more important determinant of individual and social returns to education. This section focusses on the quality of education; more information on the global rise of education can be found here.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>

Unfortunately, the data on the skills and knowledge of students is sparse and has limited spatial and temporal coverage. This is in part due to the difficulty and cost of creating and implementing standardised assessments that can be compared across borders and time.

<h3>IQ and The Flynn Effect</h3>   

The Flynn effect describes the phenomenon that over time average IQ scores have been increasing in all countries since the turn of the twentieth century (the earliest point in time for which data is available). The change in IQ scores has been approximately three IQ points per decade. One major implications of this trend is that an average individual alive today would have an IQ of 130 by the standards of 1910, making them more intelligent than 98% of the population at that time. Equivalently, an individual alive in 1910 would have an IQ of 70 by today's standards, a score that would be low enough to be considered intellectually disabled in the modern world.  In a comprehensive study of the Flynn effect, Jakob Pietschnig and Martin Voracek looked at 271 independent samples comprising 3,987,892 participants covering a time span of 105 years (1909‚Äì2013).[ref] Pietschnig, Jakob, and Martin Voracek.

<h3>Quality of Education and Test Scores</h3>


The most widely discussed quantitative assessment of quality of education is the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) by the OECD. The PISA study assess the performance of 15 year old school pupils' performance on mathematics, reading and science examinations. The tests are designed to be comparable across countries and to assess students' knowledge as well as problem solving skills. The first round of tests took place in 2000 and is repeated every three years.


The OECD PISA rankings demonstrate the strength of education in East Asian countries. These results are broadly supported by similar research conducted by the <a href="http://www.iea.nl" target="_blank">International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA)</a> and Boston College. The IEA produces assessments of mathematics and science performance (TIMSS) as well as of reading and literacy (PIRLS). The countries that consistently make up the top 5 in mathematics and the sciences are Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. The strength of this group of countries could be the result of their education systems or cultural difference that affect student behaviour in the absence of any schooling effects.

<h3>Resources</h3>

Schools require many different inputs to produce educated individuals, of which teachers and textbooks are the most fundamental. In addition to these basic resources, better schools often have better facilities and equipment. Access to the internet and computers is also increasingly important in education. Given this, it is common to consider school quality through proxies like expenditure per student, or the pupil-teacher ratio of a school. It is important to note that the link between resources and school quality is not simplistic, for more information see the <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/quality-of-education-drop-out-rates/#data-quality-definitions">Data Quality & Definitions section</a>.

<h2>Correlates, Determinants & Consequences</h2>

<h3>Teacher Quality</h3>

Research by Raj Chetty, John Friedman and Jonah Rockoff supports the idea that the quality of teachers make a significant difference to the performance of students on tests. Chetty et al. look at the impact on test scores of the entry and exit of high or low value added teachers on students performance in examinations. They find that not only does the entry of a high quality teacher improve the results of students, the presence of 'bad teachers' negatively impacts the performance of students. In addition to this, they also report that this improvement in test scores corresponds to long-term improvements in the outcomes of students.

<h3>Early Intervention, Family Environment and Culture</h3>

James Heckman makes the point that education is a continuous process. He writes, "Skill formation is a dynamic process with strong synergistic components. Skill begets skill. Early investment promotes later investment. Non-cognitive skills and motivation are important determinants of success and these can be improved more successfully and at later ages than basic cognitive skills." The following summary of the research into early intervention programmes in the US by James Heckman suggests that the effects of such programmes are significant and have long-lasting effects.[ref]Heckman, James J. "Policies to foster human capital." <em>Research in economics</em> 54, no. 1 (2000): 3-56. Available online <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944399902259" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref]



<blockquote> Disadvantaged subnormal I.Q. children in Ypsilanti, Michigan were randomly assigned to the Perry Pre-school programme and administered intensive treatment at ages 4‚Äì5. Treatment was then discontinued and the persons were followed over their life cycle. These people are now about 35 years old. Evidence indicates that those enrolled in the programme have higher earnings and lower levels of criminal behaviour in their late 20s than do comparable children randomized out of the programme. Reported cost‚Äìbenefit ratios for the programme are substantial. Measured through age 27, the programme returns $5.70 for every dollar spent. When returns are projected for the remainder of the lives of programme participants, the return on the dollar rises to $8.70. As with the Job Corps, a substantial fraction (65%) of the return to the programme has been attributed to reductions in crime (Schweinhart, Barnes & Weikart, 1993). The Syracuse Pre-school programme provided family development support for disadvantaged children from prenatal care through to age five. Reductions in problems with probation and criminal offences 10 years later were as large as 70% among children randomly assigned to the programme. Girls who participated in the programme also showed greater school achievement (Lally, Mangione & Honig, 1988). Studies of early intervention programmes have found short-term increases in test scores, less grade retention, and higher high school graduation rates among enrolled children. Of those studies that examine pre-delinquent or criminal behaviour, most have found lower rates of deviant behaviour among programme participants.</blockquote>


Another interesting aspect of school performance is the effect of family environments and culture on students exam performance. A study by John Jerrim finds that children of East Asian immigrants to Australia outperform their native counterparts in the PISA tests.[ref]Jerrim, John. "Why do East Asian children perform so well in PISA? An investigation of Western-born children of East Asian descent." <em>Oxford Review of Education</em> ahead-of-print (2015): 1-24.</p>
<p>Available online <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03057925.2015.1027509" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] In mathematics, he finds them to be ahead by 100 points representing two and a half years of education. This evidence suggests that the differences highlighted by PISA and the IEA may be driven by cultural or family factors rather than the schooling systems.

<h3>Correlation with Overall Development</h3>

Indicators of skills and knowledge, such as the OECD PISA scores, are highly correlated with indicators of economic development. The following scatter plot shows the correlation between the PISA reading scores and the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI) for a select group of countries.

<iframe src="http://ourworldindata.org/chart-builder/public/view/76" style="width:100%;height:660px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

<h3>Competition and School Quality</h3>

There exists a substantial literature on the effects of competition on school quality and performance. Whether choice improves school quality remains an open question in economics. In general we might expect that more schools might be better for outcomes through competitive forces, however this relies on both schools and parents responding to the increased competition/choice. On the demand side, parents need some way of observing school quality accurately as well as the ability to change schools. Meanwhile, schools need some incentive to respond to any increase in competition. This is especially important since most public school systems lack any profit motive.

Much of the research into the effects of competition rely on indirect measures of demand for high quality schools such as local rents and house prices. Disaggregating the willingness to pay for better schools from neighbourhood effects and sociodemographic factors is highly technical and relies on models of sorting. For more information on these models see Rothstein (American Economic Review, 2006), Bayer and McMillan (NBER, 2005), and Bayer et al. (NBER, 2007).[ref]

An alternative approach has been to use variables correlated with school competition but independent of the other the demand and supply factors to disaggregate the different effects of choice (instrumental variables approach).

<h2>Data Quality & Definitions</h2>

<h3>The Effect of Resources and Development</h3>

Recent research however suggests that the link between resources and school quality is not so simplistic. The OECD looked into whether money can buy stronger PISA test performance. They concluded that the most important factor in PISA test performance is how resources are used: countries that prioritised the quality of teachers over class sizes performed much better. This view represents a growing consensus in the education literature that inputs such as class size and expenditure per pupil have little to no effect on the returns to schooling in the developed world.[ref]Heckman, James J. "Policies to foster human capital." <em>Research in economics</em> 54, no. 1 (2000): 3-56. Available online <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090944399902259" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] The following scatter shows average spending per student from the age of 6 to 15 against reading test scores in 2009.

A more sophisticated argument is made by Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann is that the lack of any straightforward relationship between resources and school outcomes indicates a minimum resource requirement.[ref]Hanushek, Eric A., and Ludger W√∂√ümann. "The role of education quality for economic growth." World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4122 (2007). Available online <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=960379" target="_blank">here</a>.[/ref] Once the resource threshold has been reached, additional expenditure has little or no returns to school quality -- instead, teacher quality and other constraints matter far more.

Much of the focus here is on data produced by the International Institute of Advanced Systems Analysis (IIASA) based in Vienna. The research produced by IIASA is widely used by policy makers concerned with future levels of education and population trends. The methodology used is briefly discussed in this article, however interested readers should study the methodology carefully before making use of the data presented here.
<h2>Empirical View</h2>
<h3>World Population by Education Level</h3>
The <em>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</em> (IIASA) is an interdisciplinary, highly-respected research institution near Vienna, Austria. The IIASA population projections are the most cited alternative to the UN work.

An interesting feature of the IIASA population projections is that they take into account the education of the population. As shown in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">data-entry on fertility</a> there is a strong link between education and fertility¬†‚Äì more educated women have fewer children. This link is taken into account in the model of the IIASA researchers and contributes to their projection of a smaller total world population than projected by the UN (see the data-entry on world population growth for the comparison).

The breakdown by education level is especially interesting: It shows that our world will be inhabited by more and more educated people.¬†The projection¬†shows that the number of people with no education will decrease continuously and that by the end of this century virtually all people in the world will have received some level of education.

In the visualization below you also see that in 1970 there were only around 700 million people in the world that had secondary or post-secondary education. By the end of this century the number of people with secondary or post-secondary education will have increased 10-fold and will reach 7 billion people (a similar number as the world population today)!

<h3>Education of the World Population until 2050</h3>
The best available data suggests that we should see rates of education increasing as the world develops. By 2050, only five countries are predicted to have a rate of no education above 20%: these are Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali and Niger. There is also expected to be a large increase in the numbers of people obtaining degrees, while more people complete secondary school.

<h3>The Developing World: A comparison between Brazil and Russia</h3>
Compare the projections for Brazil and Russia below. While both are considered developing economies, Russia is far more educated than Brazil at present. What is more, while the population of Brazil is projected to continue growing into the future, the population of Russia is predicted to decline. By 2050, almost every Russian is expected to have completed secondary school.

<h2>Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
Back projections of education rely on cross sectional data of the highest level of educational attainment for different segments of the population. The data used is taken from the UN and is only for the year 2000; the educational attainment series is projected backwards from this single year. The year 2000 was chosen as the base year since it had the widest coverage of countries available at the time. Throughout the back projection, no other data on education is used.

Using the life expectancy and education-specific period life expectancy for each cohort, the different survival ratios are computed. This survival ratio is then used to go back one period (5 years) according to the formula:
[latex]
\[
N\left(\mbox{age}-5,\mbox{educ},t-5,\mbox{sex}\right)=\dfrac{N\left(\mbox{age},\mbox{educ},t,\mbox{sex}\right)}{SR\left(\mbox{age}-5,\mbox{educ},t-5,\mbox{sex}\right)}
\]
[/latex]

where [latex] N\left(.\right)[/latex] refers to the number of people in the group defined by [latex] \left(.\right)[/latex] and [latex] SR\left(.\right)[/latex] is the survival ratio for the group [latex] \left(.\right)[/latex]. The survival ratio accounts for both mortality and migration. Note that the model accounts for dependency of survival on education.

The projections of future education depend on the assumptions made and the IIASA produces estimates for different scenarios. The ones presented in this article are for the Global Education Trend (GET) scenario, where global education trends persist into the future. The other scenario data can be downloaded from their website.[ref]The four scenarios are:

Constant enrollment number (CEN)

Constant enrollment ratio (CER)

Global education trend (GET)

Fast-track (FT) [/ref] The methodology used to project future education trends is more sophisticated than for the back projections and so is omitted from this article.

These developments come about mostly through experimentation and research. The international research community refers to the collective and collaborative research efforts of academics around the world. Historically, research was done independently by small groups or individuals working in the more developed countries. The proliferation of the internet has arguably increased the pace of scientific discovery and further integrated research communities around the world.

<h2>Empirical View</h2>


<h3>The Birth of International the Research Community</h3>


Translations of books and the rise of Latin as the universal language of academia connected different national research communities, effectively forming an international research community. This development intensified and researchers increasingly worked together. The following graph shows the¬†rise in the number of international congresses and international organizations. The onset of the First World War damaged this effort considerably.

Compared to today, the research community in the early days of modern science was still very small and consisted mostly of scientists from countries that modernised first. The systemisation of elements in the periodic table was suggested independently by the Russian chemist¬†Dmitri Mendeleev and the German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer in 1869 and 1870, and more and more elements were added as they were discovered over the next decades. Therefore the periodic table shown below is an interesting way of demonstrating¬†which the most influential nations were during the late 19th and early 20th century.

There exist many examples in mathematics of multiple discovery prior to the development of an international research community. The most famous example of which is the discovery of calculus in the 17th century by Isaac Newton (England) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (Germany), but also arguably Pierre de Fermat. Similarly, in the 18th century Oxygen was independently discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele (Sweden, 1773), Joseph Priestley (England, 1774), and Antoine Lavoisier (France, 1777).

<h3>Nobel Prizes</h3>

A useful way to appreciate just how the international scientific community grew larger is to look at the nationality of nobel prize winners.[ref]A complete list of winners can be obtained from the Nobel Prize website <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/">here</a>. Wikipedia has a list of winners¬†by country and winners by country per capita¬†<a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Nobel_laureates_per_capita">here</a>.[/ref] The following graph shows the nationality of nobel prize winners by nationality since the prize was established. The share of nobel prizes going to the old European powers has declined, while the share going to the US and other economies has increased. German-born laureates were ahead during the first three quarters of the century; in 1976 US-born laureates took over. Note the substantial differences to the citizenship-based ranking, reflecting brain drain from Germany and other countries to the US (and also the UK).

<h3>Global Research Community Today</h3>

The global research community today is considerably larger than it was in the 20th century. The following chart shows the explosion in the number of journals in all fields of science over the past century. At the start of the 20th century there were less than 200 journals in every major field of study, and 100 years later, there are now thousands of journals and around 1600 in geology alone!

There are journals today that are entirely devoted to measuring the size of the scientific community, the international research network and the impact of research. This field is known as scientometrics and the major journals are <em>Scientometrics</em>, <em>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</em>, and <em>Journal of Informetrics</em>.


Britain's Royal Society conducted research into the composition of citation in scientific journal articles to track the recent changes taking place. They find that the proportion of citation in journals published in the established academic world (the US, UK, Germany, France and Japan) have been declining as more and more citation come from developing economies. At the same time, the total number of citations has been increasing. The report also finds¬†that academic¬†papers that are the product of international collaboration now make up 35% of the total, compared to 25% only 15 years ago.[ref]See Figure 2.1 in the above cited report of the Royal Society (<a href="http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/Influencing_Policy/Reports/2011-03-28-Knowledge-networks-nations.pdf">online here</a>).[/ref]

<h3>Open Access Science</h3>


From the previous map, we see that large parts of the world are still not part of the international research community. These countries are mostly poorer, and one obstacle that prevents them from entering the community is the large cost of academic publications. One positive trend that progressively eliminates this obstacle by radically reducing the costs of scientific knowledge is the creation of open access journals. As the following graph shows, they are a very recent development:¬†in the year 2000 only 20,700 articles were published in open-access journals. This number has been rising rapidly, and no end is in sight: in 2011 340,000 articles were¬†published in open access journals.
