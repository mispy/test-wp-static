== Frequently Asked Questions ==

__Question:__ Where do I place the image for the button? How do I include a graphic for the button?

__Answer:__ Images may be displayed using CSS. Upload the desired file and then display it using CSS, like so:

`background-image { url(/path/to/image.png) fixed no-repeat center top; }`

Fine-tune as needed to dial it in. To add via plugin settings, select "Custom" for the "Select your style" option and include for either `<div>` or `<a>` styles.
