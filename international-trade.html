In this entry we begin by analyzing available data on historical trade patterns around the world, and then move on to discuss more recent data, outlining trade patterns from the last couple of decades. In the last section, we turn to analyze empirical evidence regarding the determinants and consequences of international trade.</p><p>From a historical perspective, international trade has grown remarkably in the last couple of centuries. After a long period characterized by persistently low international trade, over the course of the 19th century, technological advances triggered a period of marked growth in world trade (the &apos;first wave of globalisation&apos;). This process of growth stopped, and was eventually reversed in the interwar period; but since the Second World War international trade started growing again, and in the last decades trade expansion has been faster than ever before. Today, the sum of exports and imports across nations is higher than 50% of global production. At the turn of the 19th century this figure was below 10%.</p><p>In the last couple of decades, transport and communication costs have decreased across the world, and preferential trade agreements have become more and more common, particularly among developing countries. In fact, trade among developing nations (often referred to as South&#x2013;South trade), more than tripled in the period 1980&#x2013;2011.</p><p>Free international trade is often seen as desirable because it allows countries to specialize, in order to produce goods that they are relatively efficient at producing, while importing other goods. This is the essence of the comparative advantage argument supporting gains from trade: exchange allows countries to &#x201C;do what they do best, and import the rest&#x201D;.</p><p>Available empirical evidence shows that while trade does lead to economic growth on the aggregate, it also creates &#x2018;winners and losers&#x2019; within countries &#x2013; so it is important to consider the distributional consequences of trade liberalization.</p></section>




<section><h2>Empirical View</h2><h3>International trade in the long run</h3><h4>International trade has grown remarkably in the last couple of centuries</h4><p>The following visualization presents a compilation of available trade estimates, showing the evolution of world exports and imports as a share of world output (you can read more about aggregate output measures in our entry on <a href="/gdp-data/">GDP</a>).</p><p>As we can see, until 1800 there was a long period characterized by persistently low international trade &#x2013; globally the sum of exports and imports never exceeded 10% before 1800. This then changed over the course of the 19th century, when technological advances triggered a period of marked growth in world trade &#x2013; the so-called &apos;first wave of globalization&apos;. Until 1913, worldwide trade grew by more than 3% annually.</p><p>The first wave of globalization came to an end with the beginning of the First World War, when the decline of liberalism and the rise of nationalism led to a slump in international trade. In the chart we see that there was a sizeable reduction on international trade in the interwar period.</p><p>After the Second World War trade started growing again. This new &#x2013; and ongoing &#x2013; wave of globalization has seen international trade grow faster than ever before. Today the sum of exports and imports across nations is higher than the value of 50% of the global production.</p><h6>World trade over 5 centuries (1500-2011)<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a><p></p>

</h6><h4>The value of global exports has grown constantly over the last two centuries</h4><p>Throughout the last two centuries, the rate of growth increased constantly &#x2013; trade grew faster and faster. This remark can be best appreciated in the following visualization, presenting estimates of world exports for the period 1800-2014. The data comes from Federico and Tena-Junguito (2016)<a id="ref-2" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-2"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">2</sup></a> and the vertical axis is in constant prices (i.e. world exports have been indexed, so that values are relative to the value of exports in the year 1913). As it can be seen, trade growth roughly followed an exponential path in the period 1800-2010. In fact, growth in exports has been so large in the last century that the interwar slump is almost not visible when we use this scale.</p><p>You can click on the option marked &apos;Linear&apos; to change into a logarithmic scale.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/world-trade-exports-constant-prices" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/world-trade-exports-constant-prices_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/world-trade-exports-constant-prices"></div></a></div></p><h4>Before the 19th century trade was strongly linked to colonialism</h4><p>Over the early modern period, transoceanic flows of goods between empires and colonies accounted for an important part of international trade. The following visualizations provides a comparison of intercontinental trade, in per capita terms, for different countries.</p><p>As we can see, intercontinental trade was very dynamic, with volumes varying considerably across time and from empire to empire.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/intercontinental-trade-per-capita-1500-1800" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/intercontinental-trade-per-capita-1500-1800_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/intercontinental-trade-per-capita-1500-1800"></div></a></div></p><h4>Trade within Europe was very important in the &apos;first wave of globalization&apos;</h4><p>The following visualization provides details regarding trade patterns for specific countries during the first wave of globalization. It shows the most common measure of international integration: trade openness, measured as the sum of exports and imports, expressed as a share of GDP.</p><p>The data shows that over the course of the 19th century, international trade became increasingly important across many nations. Yet we can also see that in some countries, trade was already very important before the 19th century. The Netherlands is a case in point: the so-called Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century stands out exceptionally in the graph.</p><p>By comparing the series labelled &apos;Europe (total)&apos; and &apos;Europe (total) without intra-Europe trade&apos;, we can also see that the &apos;first wave of globalization&apos; implied a substantial growth in trade <em>within</em> Europe.</p><h6>Exports plus imports as share of GDP in Europe, 1655-1913 &#x2013;&#xA0;Our World in Data, with data from Broadberry and O&apos;Rourke (2010)<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a><p></p>

The visualization below shows how, at the global level, costs across these three variables have been going down since 1930.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/real-transport-and-communication-costs" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/real-transport-and-communication-costs_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/real-transport-and-communication-costs"></div></a></div></p><h4>The &apos;second wave of globalization&apos; has been characterized by increasing intra-industry trade</h4><p>The &apos;first wave of globalization&apos; was characterized by inter-industry trade. This means that countries exported goods that were very different to what they imported &#x2013; England exchanged machines for Australian wool and Indian tea. This changed in the &apos;second wave of globalization&apos;. Intra-industry trade (i.e. the exchange of broadly similar goods and services) has increased substantially since the Second World War &#x2013; France now both imports and exports cars to and from Germany.</p><p>The following visualization, from the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/477365-1327525347307/8392086-1327528510568/WDR09_12_Ch06web.pdf">UN World Development Report (2009)</a>, plots the fraction of total world trade that is accounted for by intra-industry trade, by type of goods. As we can see, intra-industry trade has been going up for primary, intermediate and final goods.</p><p>This pattern of trade is important because the scope for specialisation increases if countries are able to exchange intermediate goods (e.g. auto parts) for related final goods (e.g. cars).</p><h6>Share of intraindustry trade by type of goods &#x2013; Figure 6.1 in <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/477365-1327525347307/8392086-1327528510568/WDR09_12_Ch06web.pdf">UN World Development Report (2009)</a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8652 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-750x420.png" alt="GrubelLloyd_WDR09" width="750" height="420" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-150x84.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-400x224.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-750x420.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GrubelLloyd_WDR09-768x430.png 768w"></a></p><h4>What is traded around the world?</h4><p>The <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/">Observatory for Economic Complexity (OEC)</a>, at the MIT, produces fascinating interactive visualizations of international trade patterns. The following chart shows a breakdown of world exports by product, since the 1960s. You can visit the OEC website for an <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/03l9gb">interactive version of this chart</a>, including figures in absolute terms (exports and imports by products in current US dollars).</p><p>In the figure below, we can see that oil, machinery and electronics, have been traditionally large trading sectors since the 1960s. However, electronics have grown particularly fast, while the importance of oil has declined. Today, electronics account for a larger share of world exports, and are only second to machinery.</p><h6>Composition of world exports by product type (Standard International Trade Classification) &#x2013; <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/03l9gb">OEC (2016)</a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8647 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-750x201.png" alt="OEC_Trade_Products" width="750" height="201" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-150x40.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-400x107.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-750x201.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OEC_Trade_Products-768x206.png 768w"></a></p><h3>Recent developments in bilateral and regional trade</h3><h4>Bilateral trade is more frequent than unilateral trade</h4><p>Most countries that export goods to a country, also import goods from the same country. The following visualization, from Helpman et al. (2007)<a id="ref-6" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-6"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">6</sup></a> provides evidence of this. In this figure, all possible country pairs are partitioned into three categories: the top portion represents the fraction of country pairs that do not trade with one-another; the bottom portion represents those that trade in both directions (they export to one-another); and the middle portion represents those that trade in one direction only (one country imports from, but does not export to, the other country). As we can see, the majority of trading relationships are bilateral.</p><p>Another important conclusion from the figure below is that growth in international trade throughout the second half of the 20th century took place specifically through growth in bilateral exchanges.

A preferential trade agreement is a trade pact that reduces tariffs between the participating countries for certain products.</p><p>The following visualization shows the evolution of the cumulative number of preferential trade agreements that are in force across the world, according to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). These numbers include notified and non-notified preferential agreements (the source reports that only about two-thirds of the agreements currently in force have been notified to the WTO), and are disaggregated by country groups.</p><p>This figure shows the increasingly important role of trade between developing countries (South-South trade), vis-a-vis trade between developed and developing countries (North-South trade).

These figures, produced by the World Bank, correspond to the Standard International Trade Classification, in which &apos;food&apos; includes, among other, live animals, beverages, tobacco, coffee, oils and fats.</p><p>Two important patterns emerge from the data. First, there has been a substantial decrease in the relative importance of food exports since 1960s in most countries (although in the last decade it has gone up slightly globally). And second, this decrease has been largest in middle income countries, particularly in Latin America. Colombia is a notable case in point: food went from 67% of merchandise exports in 1986, to 9% in 2013.</p><p>Regarding levels, as one would expect, in high income countries food still accounts for a much smaller share of exports than in most developing countries.<br>

<section><h2>Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</h2><h3>Explaining trade patterns</h3><h4>Countries tend to export what would be cheap to produce under autarky</h4><p>Most trade theories in the economics literature focus on sources of comparative advantage. Broadly speaking, the principle of comparative advantage postulates that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, and import the rest: &#x201C;do what you do best, import the rest&#x201D;.</p><p>For countries with relative abundance of certain factors of production, the theory thus predicts that they will export goods that rely heavily in those factors: a country typically has a comparative advantage in those goods that use more intensively its abundant resources. Under this theory, Colombia exports bananas to Europe because it has comparatively abundant tropical weather. Under autarky, Colombia would find it cheap to produce bananas relative to e.g. apples.</p><p>The empirical evidence suggests that the principle of comparative advantage does help explain trade patterns. Bernhofen and Brown (2004)<a id="ref-8" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-8"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">8</sup></a>, for instance, provide evidence using the experience of Japan. Specifically, they exploit Japan&#x2019;s dramatic nineteenth-century move from a state of near complete isolation to wide trade openness.</p><p>The following graph shows the price changes of the key tradable goods after the opening up to trade. It presents a scatter diagram of the net exports in 1869 graphed in relation to the change in prices from 1851&#x2013;53 to 1869. As we can see, this is consistent with the theory: after opening to trade, the relative prices of major exports such as silk increased (Japan exported what was cheap for them to produce and which was valuable abroad), while the relative price of imports such as sugar declined (they imported what was relatively more difficult for them to produce, but was cheap abroad).</p><h6>Net exports and price changes for 1869, Japan &#x2013; Figure 4 in Bernhofen and Brown (2014)<a id="ref-9" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-9"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">9</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8677 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-750x487.png" alt="japan_bernhoffenbrown2014" width="750" height="487" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-150x97.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-400x260.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-750x487.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-768x499.png 768w"></a></p><h4>Financial institutions affect trade</h4><p>Conducting international trade requires that producers in exporting countries have access to external capital, such as credit.<br>
The following scatter plot, from Manova (2013)<a id="ref-10" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-10"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">10</sup></a> shows the correlation between levels in private credit (specifically exporters&#x2019; private credit as a share of GDP) and exports (average log bilateral exports across destinations and sectors). As can be seen, financially developed economies &#x2013; those with more dynamic private credit markets &#x2013; typically outperform exporters with less evolved financial institutions.</p><p>Other academic research has shown that non-economic institutions are also important determinants of trade. Country-specific language knowledge for example, has been shown to promote foreign relative to domestic trade (see Melitz 2008<a id="ref-11" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-11"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">11</sup></a>).</p><h6>Bilateral exports and countries&#x2019; financial development &#x2013; Figure 2 in Manova (2013)<a id="ref-12" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-12"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">12</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8679 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-658x550.png" alt="credittrade_manova2013" width="658" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-150x125.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-400x334.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-658x550.png 658w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CreditTrade_Manova2013-768x642.png 768w"></a></p><h4>Trade diminishes dramatically with distance</h4><p>The resistance that geography imposes on trade has long been studied in the empirical economics literature, typically under the label of &apos;gravity trade models&apos;. The main conclusion in this literature is that trade intensity is strongly linked to geographic distance.</p><p>The following visualization, from Eaton and Kortum (2002)<a id="ref-13" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-13"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">13</sup></a>, graphs &apos;normalized import shares&apos; against distance. Each dot represents a country-pair from a set of 19 OECD countries, and both the vertical and horizontal axis are expressed on logarithmic scales (1995 data). The &apos;normalized import shares&apos; in the vertical axis provide a measure of how much each country imports from different partners (see the paper for details on how this is calculated and normalised), while distance in the horizontal axis corresponds to separation between central cities in each country (see the paper and references therein for details on the list of cities). As we can see, there is a strong negative relationship. Through econometric modelling, the paper shows that this relationship is not just a correlation driven by other factors: their findings suggest that distance still imposes a significant cost on trade.</p><h6>Import share versus distance, country pairs for a set of 19 OECD countries, 1990 &#x2013; Figure 1 in Eaton and Kortum (2002)<a id="ref-14" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-14"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">14</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8684" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-750x461.png" alt="eatonkortum2002_tradedistance" width="750" height="461" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-150x92.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-400x246.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-750x461.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EatonKortum2002_TradeDistance-768x472.png 768w"></a><br>
The fact that trade diminishes with distance is also corroborated by data of trade intensity within countries. The following visualization shows, through a series of maps, the geographic distribution of French firms that export to France&apos;s neighboring countries. The colors reflect the percentage of firms which export to each specific country. As we can see, the share of firms exporting to each of the corresponding neighbors is largest close to the border. The authors also show in the paper that this pattern holds for the value of individual-firm exports &#x2013; trade value decreases with distance to the border.</p><h6>Percentage of firms which export in France, by importing country, 1992 &#x2013; Figure 2 in Crozet and Koenig (2010)<a id="ref-15" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-15"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">15</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8689" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-446x550.jpg" alt="france_trade_borders_2010" width="446" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-32x32.jpg 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-50x50.jpg 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-64x64.jpg 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-96x96.jpg 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-122x150.jpg 122w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-128x128.jpg 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-325x400.jpg 325w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-446x550.jpg 446w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/France_Trade_Borders_2010-768x946.jpg 768w"></a></p><h3>Trade and economic performance</h3><h4>How is trade related to economic growth?</h4><p>A useful first step to establish whether trade and economic growth are somehow related is to search for correlations. The following figure, from Ventura (2006)<a id="ref-16" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-16"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">16</sup></a>, plots the growth rates of these two variables against each other, using pooled data from various regions and periods. Each dot in this plot corresponds to growth in a specific world region during a specific time period. There are in total seven regions (Western Europe, Western Offshoots, Eastern Europe and former USSR, Latin America, Asia and Africa) across four periods (1870&#x2013;1913, 1913&#x2013;1950, 1950&#x2013;1973 and 1973&#x2013;1998). As can be seen, there is a strong positive correlation between growth in per capita income and growth in trade.</p><p>This relationship is only a correlation, and does not imply causation &#x2013; countries differ in many aspects other than trade openness, and hence we cannot attribute the observed differences in growth to differences in trade. In other words, trade is &apos;endogenous&apos;: countries whose incomes are high for reasons other than trade, may trade more.</p><p>The academic economics literature has tried to address the issue of endogeneity in a number of ways. In a seminal paper, Frankel and Romer (1999) suggest using geography as a proxy for trade. The idea is that geography is fixed, and mainly affects national income through trade &#x2013; so if we observe that a country&apos;s distance from other countries is a powerful predictor of economic growth (after accounting for other characteristics), then it must be because <em>trade</em> has an effect on economic growth. Following this logic, the authors suggest that there is a strong positive causal effect of trade on economic growth. This, of course, does not prove that trade is the only driver of growth &#x2013; indeed, the related findings from Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi (2004)<a id="ref-17" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-17"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">17</sup></a>, suggest that trade matters through its interaction with other institutions, like the rule of law.

</h6><h4>How does trade affect the distribution of incomes?</h4><p>A core prediction of <a href="/international-trade-new-draft/#countries-tend-to-export-what-would-be-cheap-to-produce-under-autarky">the above-mentioned &apos;comparative advantage&apos; theories of trade</a> is that, through liberalization and economic integration, the relative prices of goods will change. In its simplest form, the prediction is that countries that open up to trade will see the relative prices of some goods go up, while others will go down. It is clear, then, that even such simple and stylized prediction implies that trade creates winners and losers, depending on what different people produce and consume, and what factors of production they can contribute to the economy.</p><p>A growing empirical literature in economics has tried to address the question of whether trade liberalization helps specifically the incomes of those at the bottom of the distribution. Topalova (2010) finds that the 1991 Indian trade liberalization, had a negative effect on poverty reductions: rural districts in which production sectors were more exposed to liberalization, experienced slower decline in poverty and lower consumption growth. The author provides evidence suggesting that the reason for this was the fact that those who were worse off struggled to relocate to other sectors, in order to reap the benefits from trade. Here again we see how trade interacts with region-specific characteristics that determine the consequence of trade.</p><p>Other studies, using data from other countries, have also found that trade may have important distributional consequences. Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013)<a id="ref-20" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-20"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">20</sup></a>, for example, study the consequences for the US of rising Chinese imports in the period 1990-2007. The visualization below shows a scatter plot of cross-regional exposure to rising imports, against changes in employment. Each dot on this graph corresponds to a different area within the US (&apos;commuting zones&apos;, CZs); the vertical axis shows the percent change in manufacturing employment for working age population; and the horizontal axis shows what the authors predict to be the per-worker exposure of the different areas to rising imports (depending on industrial composition, etc.). As can be seen, there is a negative correlation. In fact, the authors go beyond, and suggest that rising Chinese imports in the period 1990-2007 <em>caused</em> higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries (see the paper for details on the empirical strategy used to determine causality).</p><p>While both of the studies mentioned above suggest a negative impact of trade on <a href="/income-inequality/">income inequality</a>, they do not prove that e.g. India or the US were on the whole made worse-off because of trade. In fact, there are other studies, such as Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016)<a id="ref-21" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-21"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">21</sup></a>, that show that trade does favour specifically the poor. The aspect via which trade benefits the poor is consumption &#x2013; they find that the relative change in prices produced by trade typically favors the poor, who concentrate spending in more traded sectors. This is at the heart of the classic trade-off in public economics: efficiency sometimes comes at the cost of equity.</p><h6>Change in manufacturing employment by commuting zones in the US, 1990-2007 &#x2013; Figure 2b in Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013)<a id="ref-22" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-22"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">22</sup></a><br>

Notes on the calculation of the lower and upper bound estimates from the authors: <em>"1500–1800: Trade growth rates from O’Rourke and Williamson [2002, Table 1; volume estimates only]. Level index derived, and scaled by world GDP levels from Maddison [2001, Table B-18]. The “upper bound” series is then scaled to the benchmark 8 percent European trade-GDP ratio for 1780 due to O’Brien [1982], probably an overstatement of the world trade-GDP ratio. The “lower bound” series is scaled to the benchmark 2 percent world trade-GDP ratio for 1820 due to Maddison [1995, Table 2-4], possibly biased downwards relative to the long-run trend because of the blockades during the Napoleonic Wars."</em></p></div></li><li id="note-2" style="margin-top: 0px;" class="side-matter side-matter-note"><div class="side-matter side-matter-text"><p>Federico, Giovanni and Antonio Tena-Junguito (2016).

Original source note: <em>This figure plots annualized rate of trade growth against annualized rate of per capita GDP growth for major world regions and selected periods. The regions are Western Europe, Western Offshoots, Eastern Europe and former USSR, Latin America, Asia and Africa. Periods are 1870–1913, 1913–1950, 1950–1973 and 1973–1998. Each data point stands for one region during one period. The solid line represents the prediction of a linear regression. The estimated regression are reported in the box, t-statistics are in brackets. Data are from Angus Maddison, “The World Economy – A Millennial Perspective”. Data for GDP growth are obtained from Table 3-1b, p. 126, and Table B-10, p. 241 (to include Japan). Data for export growth are derived from Table F-3, p. 362, and Tables A1-b, A2-b, A3-b and A4-b, pp. 184, 194, 214 and 223, respectively.</em>
