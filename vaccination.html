As vaccines can disrupt transmission of infection, they not only protect the vaccinated individuals but the wider community also.&#xA0;These public health benefits are the reason why some governments pay all or part of the costs of vaccinations in national vaccination schedules. In addition to governments there are a large number of other institutions that contribute to vaccination efforts. These include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), public health institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and more recently the public-private partnership <em>Gavi</em> (the Vaccine Alliance).<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>There is a technical difference between vaccination and immunization, as the National Health Service (NHS)&#xA0;<a href="http://www.shb.scot.nhs.uk/board/publichealth/immunisation.asp">explains</a>: &#x201C;Vaccination means having a vaccine &#x2013; that is actually getting the injection, or nasal spray or oral vaccine. Immunization means both receiving a vaccine and then becoming immune to a disease&#x201D;. The distinction is made because in a very small number of those who are vaccinated the vaccination will not &#x2018;take&#x2019; and therefore that vaccinated person will not be immunized (i.e. will not be immune to the disease). However, as this refers to a very small number of people both terms are often used interchangeably across the academic literature and in media reporting and we will follow this convention in this entry.</p><p>Below the absolute number of one-year-olds who have received the vaccination is shown in <a href="/grapher/the-worlds-number-of-vaccinated-one-year-olds">this chart</a>.</p><p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="/grapher/share-of-vaccinated-one-year-olds-globally" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p><p>Vaccines create immunity in an individual without them having to encounter the pathogen. This is achieved by introducing a weakened or killed form of the disease agent that make us ill &#x2013; such as bacteria or viruses &#x2013; or its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The vaccine induces acquired immunity&#xA0;so that when your body encounters the real disease-causing agent it is ready to mount a defense.</p><p>More information about vaccines in general can be found on the World Health Organization (WHO) page on <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/immunization/en/">immunisation</a>.</p></section>

Empirical View</h2><h3 id="the-history-of-vaccine-innovation"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-history-of-vaccine-innovation"></a>I.1 The history of vaccine innovation</h3><p>An early form of vaccination was called&#xA0;variolation (more broadly referred to as inoculation). Practised in Asia, this was an ancient technique of deliberate smallpox infection with dried&#xA0;smallpox scabs blown up the nose to expose the person to a form of the disease which was often milder.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> By the 1700s variolation had spread to Africa, India and the Ottoman Empire, followed by the UK and America, where the method of infection more frequently used was a puncture to the skin.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#xA0;Variolation did work for many people, but there were risks. Those variolated could contract the more severe form of smallpox and die, and they could also transmit the disease to others. In 1796 English physician Edward Jenner demonstrated another method of inoculation, using cowpox, a similar disease that had previously been observed to protect against smallpox. Jenner conducted an experiment using matter from a cowpox lesion to inoculate his gardener&#x2019;s eight-year-old son James Phipps. Two months later Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox lesion matter&#xA0;and when Phipps did not develop smallpox, it showed he was protected against the disease.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> Jenner called the procedure &#x2018;vaccination&#x2019;.</p><p>Following the findings of Jenner as the first scientific attempt to control disease by vaccination, the smallpox vaccine went through many iterations, with the newer vaccines produced by modern cell culture techniques (passing the virus through cell culture makes the vaccine safer). By the middle of the 20th century confidence grew that smallpox could be the first disease eradicated by humankind. In 1967 the WHO launched a <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">global eradication of smallpox program</a>. Mass vaccination of over 80% of a country&apos;s population ensued but people who were nomadic or lived in politically unstable regions posed particular problems. A number of innovations came in the development of foot-powered injector called the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">&#x201C;ped-o-jet&#x201D; and then the bifurcated needle</a>, which was efficient and cost-effective to use.</p><p>In order to reach large sections of population, epidemiologist <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">William Foege</a> developed Eradication Escalation (E2) to contain smallpox outbreaks during October (the seasonal low point of smallpox transmission where prevention of a case could stop a smallpox chain transmission). <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">Other obstacles faced</a> included forcibly vaccinating an Indian religious leader to convince his followers to be vaccinated, negotiation of ceasefires for vaccine transport in war-torn Nigeria, vaccinating in concentric rings around an outbreak, and cash bounties to reward the reporting of smallpox cases. Finally in 1977 the last case of naturally contracted smallpox was reported in Somalia, in Ali Maow Maalin, and in 1980 the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">WHO announced that smallpox had been eradicated</a>.</p><p>Eradication is the ultimate goal of vaccination against a disease. For other diseases, a vaccine has been less forthcoming. The first visualization below shows a timeline of innovation in the development of vaccines. Each bar begins in the year in which the pathogenic agent was first linked to the disease and the bar ends in the year in which a vaccination against that pathogen was licensed in the US.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14773" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-724x550.png" alt="" width="724" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-150x114.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-400x304.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-724x550.png 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-768x583.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-768x538.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 3000w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>For some diseases there has been a relatively short timespan between when the infectious agent was linked to the disease and a vaccine was developed. The quickest was 10 years for measles, with the agent linked to the disease in 1953 and the vaccine licensed in the U.S. in 1963. <a href="/malaria/">Malaria</a> is proving harder as it has been over 135 years since the agent was linked to the disease. A vaccine is now in development &#x2013; RTS,S is undergoing pilot trials in select countries after being approved by European regulators in 2015. Vaccine innovation has followed both scientific and political-economic developments:</p><ul>
<li>Bacterial culture techniques which allowed the development of&#xA0;bacterial vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in the early 1900s.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li>The first and second world wars prompted combined efforts by universities, governments, and private companies.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>By the 1950s&#xA0;viral tissue culture techniques allowed the development of vaccines against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox).</li>
<li>New technologies in molecular biology and advanced chemistry techniques&#xA0;have most recently led to vaccines against hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcus, which causes pneumonia and meningococus, which causes meningitis and septicaemia.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
</ul><h3 id="diseases-preventable-through-vaccination"><a class="deep-link" href="#diseases-preventable-through-vaccination"></a>I.2 Diseases preventable through vaccination</h3><p>The most common and serious vaccine-preventable diseases tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) are the following:<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><ol>
<li><strong>Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3):</strong> are all bacterial diseases and a combination vaccine against all three diseases is commonly used.
<ul>
<li>Diphtheria primarily infects the throat and upper airways and is fatal in 5 &#x2013; 10% of cases.</li>
<li>Tetanus is not passed person-to-person but through spores of a bacteria living in soil and animal intestinal tracts. These bacteria enter the body through wounds and release a toxin that affects the nerves, which causes muscle stiffness and spasms.</li>
<li>Pertussis is a highly contagious disease of the respiratory tract. Children who contractpertussis tend to have coughing spells that last four to eight weeks but the highest fatality is in young infants.&#xA0;Vaccinating health workers and pregnant women is the most effective strategy for preventing disease in infants too young to be vaccinated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Haemophilus influenzae type b</em> (Hib):</strong> is a bacterial infection that causes meningitis and pneumonia transmitted through the respiratory tract from infected to susceptible individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Hepatitis B (HepB):</strong> is a highly contagious viral infection that attacks the liver and is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. As the chart below shows, it is estimated that about 100,300 people die each year due to consequences of hepatitis B. The WHO recommends that all infants should receive their first dose of vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Poliomyelitis (Pol3):</strong> is a highly infectious viral disease. Once the poliovirus invades the nervous system it can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. No cure exists for polio, only treatment to alleviate symptoms. As we detail in our separate entry on polio the world is on its way to eradicate the disease thanks to the vaccine against the virus. While in the 1980s there were 350,000 paralytic cases of polio every year, the world saw only 42 cases in 2016.</li>
<li><strong>Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR):</strong> are all viral diseases.
<ul>
<li>Measles is a&#xA0;highly contagious killer of young children globally, despite a safe and effective vaccine being available. Around 70,000 people die because of measles every year, the huge majority of whom (87%) are children younger than 5 (falling from 90,000 in 2016).</li>
<li>Mumps infection occurs via direct human contact or by airborne droplets. It causes painful swelling at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), fever, headache and muscle aches. It can cause sterility in teenagers and adults.</li>
<li>Rubella is usually mild in children, but infection during early pregnancy leads in 90% of cases to fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome, which can&#xA0;result in serious defects of the brain, heart, eyes, and ears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meningococcal meningitis (&#x2018;MenA, B, C, W X and Y&#x2019;)</strong>: is a bacterial disease which can cause severe brain damage and is often deadly. Transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets or secretions, it kills more than 120,000 people every year.</li>
<li><strong>Tuberculosis (TB):</strong> is a bacterial disease transmitted by people infected with pulmonary (lung) TB. The BCG vaccination is only partially effective providing some protection against severe forms of TB in children but is unreliable against adult pulmonary TB. Every year, 1.2 million people die because of TB.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow fever (YF):</strong> is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. There are 42 countries and territories at risk for yellow fever in Africa and the Americas. In these 42 countries and territories, vaccine coverage is estimated at 45%.</li>
</ol><p>The WHO have a larger list of <a href="http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/en/">26 diseases</a> for which vaccines are available (including Japanese encephalitis, pneumococcal disease, varicella/chicken pox, HPV, Hepatitis A and rotavirus).

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that reasons for shortages were multi-factoral from: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/clinical-resources/shortages.html">&quot;...companies leaving the vaccine market, manufacturing or production problems, and insufficient stockpiles&quot;.</a> In 2018, shortages where supplies of vaccines were critically low included those that target <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">yellow fever, hepatitis B, cholera, meningitis C, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis A, and tuberculosis</a>.</p><p>Concerns about the supply of vaccines in an epidemic or pandemic have been raised. For example, the supply of yellow fever vaccine was limited for the outbreak in Angola in 2016 leading to the recommendation of a fractional dose to extend existing supplies.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">Laurie Garrett argues</a> that because the drug had become so cheap (60 cents for each vaccine 2008) few companies wanted to make it and world stocks of the vaccine were nearing zero, forcing the WHO to dilute donated vaccines from countries like Brazil (which sent 18 million doses) by 5 to 1 with the hope they would still work. Romania experienced a situation of parallel vaccine exports in 2016 where more vaccines were exported than was supplied to meet the country&apos;s needs. A shortage of the&#xA0;measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was partly responsible for the measles outbreak in 2016-17.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>There are five big pharmaceutical companies&#xA0;<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> that account for 80% of vaccine production: Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer, and Novartis (<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/11444023/GSK-and-Novartis-complete-deals-to-reshape-both-drugmakers.html">since 2014 their vaccine business was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline</a>). Many vaccines are only provided by one or two suppliers. For newer vaccines there are often particularly few suppliers due to the high investment needed to develop a vaccine. Although having patents attached can lead to high profits. Prevenar, the brand name for the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), was hugely profitable for the pharmaceutical company Wyeth (purchased by Pfizer in 2009), with sales in 2005 of $1.5 billion. One vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria (td) has a large number of suppliers (13, and 7 for the paediatric formulation).</p><h4 id="the-cost-of-vaccines"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-cost-of-vaccines"></a><strong>The cost of vaccines</strong></h4><p>The WHO reports that vaccines produced by a greater number of suppliers creates a more competitive environment and this ultimately drives down prices.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p class="p2">As a share of the <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">global pharmaceutical market worth over $1 trillion a year, vaccines make up a small proportion $24 billion or about 2.4 percent</a>.&#xA0;In the past vaccines were often viewed as less profitable treatments for pharma companies, which led to a lack of investment and some companies pulling out of production altogether.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> But this has changed as the revenue of the global vaccines market has increased and richer country governments and insurance companies have been willing to pay more for new vaccines.

Ukraine stands out as having particularly low DTP vaccination rates in 2015 of 23%, falling from 98% in 1999.

Correlates, Determinants, and Consequences</h2><h3 id="how-vaccines-work-herd-immunity-and-reasons-for-caring-about-broad-vaccination-coverage"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-vaccines-work-herd-immunity-and-reasons-for-caring-about-broad-vaccination-coverage"></a>II.1 How vaccines work, herd Immunity, and reasons for caring about broad vaccination coverage</h3><p>Vaccines typically induce acquired immunity via an agent inside the vaccine. The agent can be made of killed or weakened forms of the microorganism, its toxins or its surface proteins.</p><p>There is a collective social benefit in more people vaccinating. For most diseases, the greater the proportion of people who are immunized, the better protected is everyone in the population as the disease transmission can be reduced or stopped. Herd immunity is a community protection that is created when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, such that it is difficult for infectious diseases to spread.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></p><p>Herd immunity provides a protective barrier, especially also for those who cannot be vaccinated. These include vulnerable groups such as babies too young to be vaccinated or immune-compromised children who are the first potential victims of low vaccination rates.</p><p>When a person is immune to a disease they can act as a barrier to slow down or prevent the transmission of disease to other people. When the number of people in a population that are immune against a disease is reached, such that a disease no longer persists in the population, this is called the herd immunity threshold (HIT). The table below shows the HIT for several diseases. Measles and pertussis are highly contagious airborne diseases and a larger share of people need to be vaccinated to stop the transmission. Because of this these diseases have the highest HIT rates that need to be reached. For example measles vaccination offers 99% protection, while in the absence of immunisatio, the lifetime risk of infection is nearly 100%.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><h6>Herd Immunity Thresholds of vaccine-preventable diseases<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></h6><p><div class="tableContainer"><table class="tablepress"><thead><tr><th>Disease</th><th>Transmission</th><th>Basic reproduction number</th><th>Herd Immunity Threshold</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr><td>Measles</td><td>Airborne</td><td>12&#x2013;18</td><td>92&#x2013;95%</td></tr><tr><td>Pertussis</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>12&#x2013;17</td><td>92&#x2013;94%</td></tr><tr><td>Diphtheria</td><td>Saliva</td><td>6&#x2013;7</td><td>83&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Rubella</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>6&#x2013;7</td><td>83&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Smallpox</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>5&#x2013;7</td><td>80&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Polio</td><td>Fecal-oral route</td><td>5&#x2013;7</td><td>80&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Mumps</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>4&#x2013;7</td><td>75&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>SARS</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>2&#x2013;5</td><td>50&#x2013;80%</td></tr><tr><td>Ebola</td><td>Bodily fluids</td><td>1.5&#x2013;2.5</td><td>33&#x2013;60%</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>1.5&#x2013;1.8</td><td>33&#x2013;44%</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p><h3 id="determining-impact-why-do-vaccine-schedules-differ-and-what-is-the-effect-of-vaccination-compared-with-better-hygiene"><a class="deep-link" href="#determining-impact-why-do-vaccine-schedules-differ-and-what-is-the-effect-of-vaccination-compared-with-better-hygiene"></a>II.2 Determining impact: Why do vaccine schedules differ and what is the effect of vaccination compared with better hygiene?</h3><h4 id="the-chickenpox-example"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-chickenpox-example"></a>The chickenpox example</h4><p>Chickenpox&#xA0;(varicella) is an example of a vaccine that some countries adopt into their routine childhood vaccination schedules, while others do not. The question that follows is why there is a difference in opinion for introducing widespread uptake of a vaccine or not. Japan was one of the first countries to adopt universal chickenpox vaccination.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p><p>Australia, Canada, Germany, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Uruguay, U.S., Italy (Sicily only) and Spain (Madrid only) followed afterwards and adopted universal chickenpox vaccination. When extreme cases of chickenpox have occurred there have been calls for the vaccine to become <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-36952432">available for free</a> through the National Health Service in the UK. However, most European countries do not vaccinate against chickenpox, except for &apos;at risk&apos; groups. The main reason for not adopting universal vaccination is the high cost. Additional supporting justifications are that it is usually a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1032.aspx?CategoryID=62">mild disease</a> and the&#xA0;benefit of fewer cases of shingles &#x2013; as explained <a href="https://theconversation.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chickenpox-and-why-more-countries-dont-use-the-vaccine-63473">here</a>.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US ran&#xA0;the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/surveillance/vasp.html">Varicella Active Surveillance Project</a> (VASP)&#xA0;from 1995 through to 2010 to monitor the&#xA0;impact of the varicella vaccination program and the key finding is shown in the chart below. The coverage of the vaccine in&#xA0;Los Angeles County rose from 37.9% in 1997 to 95.1% in 2010, and in Philadelphia from 41.2% in 1997 to 94.6% in 2010&#xA0;(one-dose vaccinations for children between 19 and 35 months of age). By 2010, varicella incidence declined by 98% in Antelope Valley (California) and West Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) compared with 1995. Outbreaks and hospitalizations also decreased rapidly. From 1995 to 1998, hospitalization rates ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 per 100,000 population but by 2006-2010 this had declined to 0.2 per 100,000 in Antelope Valley and 0.5 per 100,000 in Philadelphia.</p><p>Chickenpox is an example that can also help to answer the question of whether better hygiene or vaccination are in fact responsible for the reduced rates of disease. Although both are important, a more recently adopted vaccination such as chickenpox can demonstrate the effects of vaccination in reducing the rate of disease after the importance of hygiene was discovered and became a preventative measure against disease. As hygiene standards already reached high levels, the additional benefit of the vaccine is confirmed. The impact on disease rates demonstrate it is not hygiene but vaccination that reduced the incidence of chickenpox so dramatically in the US.</p><h6>Chickenpox incidence in two counties in the US, 2000-2010<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a>

The original anti-vaccination organisation &apos;Anti-compulsory Vaccination League&apos; was established in the UK in 1866 as a protest against smallpox vaccination mandates.&#xA0; In the late 1880s and 1900s opposition to vaccines in the U.S was organised through the &apos;Anti-Vaccination League of America&apos; and the &apos;American Medical Liberty League&apos;.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> It is important to note however, that there are similaries and differences to opposition to vaccination across time and place. In the 19th century resistance could be attributed to concern about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, which were an unregulated industry along with a dislike for the extension of state powers. Furthermore the opposition was mostly aimed at the one vaccine available at the time for smallpox.</p><p>In the 20th and 21st century, vaccine resistance in both higher and lower income countries has been attributed to a mixture of reasons including safety concerns and suspicion of state power. In higher income countries a number of controversies have arisen due to fear and uncertainty about side effects. In the 1970s and 1980s the DPT vaccine was questioned in connection with permanent brain injury or encephalopathy, but studies showed no connection. In the late 1990s and early 2000s MMR was connected with bowel symptoms and autism by a 1998 paper authored by Andrew Wakefield and others. The paper was later retracted by the journal (The Lancet) and Wakefield struck off the UK medical register, after the results were found to be fraudulent.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p><p>In lower income countries examples of opposition can be seen in worries about government powers. In&#xA0;Channai (Madras) India the 1950s, oppostion to BCG vaccination was a regional push-back against the will of nationalist and outside post-colonial forces.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p><p>Resistance to polio vaccination in some majority Muslim countries has also been attributed partly to underlying political reasons. There are only two countries that have never been able to stop the transmission of polio: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Jonathan Kennedy and Domna Michailidou <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/islamist-polio-vaccination-opposition-by-jonathan-kennedy-and-domna-michailidou-2015-10?barrier=accessreg">explain</a> some of the political dynamics behind <a href="/grapher/polio-vaccine-coverage-of-one-year-olds?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL+NGA+AFG+PAK">the low vaccination rates in Nigeria and Pakistan</a>. In Nigeria the opposition to the vaccine reflected political shifts where a majority Muslim population in the North feared the intervention of the newly appointed Christian majority government. In Pakistan Pashtun communities resist the expansion of the Pakistani state and Pakistani Taliban hostility was fueled by the fake hepatitis vaccination campaign led by the CIA to try to gather DNA to help find Osama Bin Laden. In Afghanistan it appears that supply problems persist in a post-conflict country.<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a></p><p><strong>Results from the&#xA0;<em>Vaccine Confidence Project</em></strong></p><p>To view vaccination beliefs and attitudes on a global scale across countries, researchers at the <a href="http://www.vaccineconfidence.org/"><em>Vaccine Confidence Project</em></a> have begun to measure worldwide scepticism of vaccination.<a id="ref-32" class="ref" href="#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a></p><p>The world map shows that in most countries the huge majority considers vaccines to be safe. But in some countries &#x2013; several former Soviet countries, France, and Japan &#x2013; a substantial share of the population disagrees. In France 41% of the population does not consider vaccinations safe. In other countries the share&#xA0;that is of the same opinion is smaller than 10% (in Bangladesh only 0.2%).</p><p>We have produced several graphs that show the share of people who view vaccination as:&#xA0;&quot;<a href="/grapher/share-that-disagrees-that-vaccines-are-effective">effective</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/grapher/share-disagrees-vaccines-are-important-for-children-to-have">important for children to have</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="/grapher/share-that-disagrees-vaccines-compatible-with-their-religious-beliefs">compatible with their religious beliefs</a>&quot;.<a id="ref-33" class="ref" href="#note-33"><sup>33</sup></a></p><p>Beliefs and attitudes do not translate straightforwardly into behaviour.

Which policy is followed has depended much on historical legacy, which becomes clear when one considers some of the different regulations and their history around the world:</p><p><em>Compulsory vaccination:</em> Many Eastern Bloc countries introduced compulsory vaccination during the communist era. Vaccination was previously compulsory in Romania for example and after a drop in vaccination rates the country is going through the process of reintroducing compulsory vaccination. The same is true for Italy and also France, which had compulsory vaccination for three diseases but increased this number to 11 in January 2018 in response to a drop in vaccination rates.</p><p><em>Vaccine requirements</em> <em>and mandates:</em> The US has mandates for vaccination where a child is required to be vaccinated to enter state school or daycare. An early case in the US paved the way for state jurisdiction to protect public health in light of personal liberty.<a id="ref-34" class="ref" href="#note-34"><sup>34</sup></a> In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905) the Supreme Court ruled that states have the authority to require vaccination against smallpox during a smallpox epidemic. Since then the United States has had a history of school vaccination requirements. The increased number of children in public schools as a result of the compulsory school attendance law led to an increased risk of smallpox outbreaks, through close contact in large crowded classrooms.<a id="ref-35" class="ref" href="#note-35"><sup>35</sup></a> Similarly in Australia two policies penalize parents for not vaccinating their children. The &apos;No jab no play&apos; policy removed unvaccinated children from state-sponsored childcare. The 2016 &apos;No jab no pay&apos; policy removes state welfare by not providing the universal &apos;Family Allowance&apos; welfare payments for parents who are conscientious objectors of vaccination.</p><p><em>Voluntary vaccination:</em> Some countries where vaccination is voluntary had early pushback against vaccination, as in the UK and the Netherlands. In 1853 a law was passed in England and Wales requiring universal vaccination against smallpox, but opposition from anti-vaccinationists led to laws being passed to allow for conscientious objection.<a id="ref-36" class="ref" href="#note-36"><sup>36</sup></a></p><p><em>Vaccination for country entry:</em> For countries in Africa and South America where yellow fever is endemic or where the mosquito vector is present a certificate of proof of vaccination is required. Only then will the country issue a visa upon entry to that country to prevent importation of this disease (particularly if travellers come from, or have visited yellow fever endemic areas).<a id="ref-37" class="ref" href="#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a> In past centuries (17th to 19th), yellow fever was transported to North America and Europe, causing large outbreaks that disrupted economies and development, and in some cases decimated populations. Throughout the 18th and 19th century, yellow fever was among the most feared diseases in the ports of the Old and New World. Saudi Arabia is the only country that requires the <a href="http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20170408/en/">additional vaccinations of meningococcal disease and polio</a> for pilgrims visiting Mecca.</p><h4 id="does-it-work-to-make-vaccinations-compulsory"><a class="deep-link" href="#does-it-work-to-make-vaccinations-compulsory"></a>Does it work to make vaccinations compulsory?</h4><p>Whether compulsory vaccination results in improved vaccination rates is not a straightforward question to tackle because it is highly dependant on country context, historical circumstance, cultural and social norms, as well as the practicalities of implementing and enforcing such a law. Certainly in <a href="https://theconversation.com/despite-scepticism-europe-has-high-vaccination-rates-but-it-shouldnt-be-complacent-75169">Eastern Bloc countries</a> when the vaccination law was compulsory, vaccination rates have been high but it is unclear whether to attribute this to the law or the behaviours and mechanisms of compliance under communist rule. Certain vaccinations have historically been compulsory such as smallpox, polio, and yellow fever. Here vaccination rates have also been high but it also encouraged organised opposition to vaccination and public discontent. This is a major concern for public health authorities that a relationship of trust, between governments and citizens is threatened (particularly for health where a rhetoric of self-responsibility, personalisation, and choice is encouraged). There are countries with high vaccination rates without compulsory vaccination and governments do not want to disrupt public trust and self-responsibility by making vaccination compulsory, particularly if it is not seen as needed. It has been argued that high coverage has been achieved through &quot;other approaches or efforts&quot; and so acceptance of compulsory vaccination might be problematic in countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a> In recent years governments have acted in response to epidemics to make vaccinations compulsory, as we have seen for 2017-18 with compulsory vaccinations in France, Italy, Germany, and Romania.</p><p>One country where we can see variation in vaccination policy and the effects this has is the US. In the US states decide on what exemptions are allowed for the mandate for children to receive vaccinations to access education and daycare. The reasons for such laws in the first place came with a free, public education system, which also unfortunately meant schools became sites of epidemics for childhood diseases. Exemptions are granted for medical reasons but many states also allow for philosophical, personal belief or religious exemptions. Only three states &#x2013; Mississippi, West Virginia, and California &#x2013; only allow for medical exemption. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-10-at-15.31.35.png">Californian immunization rates have increased</a> following a new Senate Bill SB 277 in 2015 to remove non-medical exemptions to vaccination. We can see on the chart below that there is not a strong correlation between stricter requirements for vaccination (i.e. only allowing for medical exemptions). Indeed Mississippi does often top the list as having the highest vaccination rates and only medical exemptions are allowed in the state but also starkly Mississippi residents are also the consistently the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.de/unhealthiest-states-in-the-us-health-rankings-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T">unhealthiest</a> and <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2017/09/14/mississippi-still-worst-poverty-household-income-u-s/">poorest</a> in the entire country. Health outcomes are very poor and most cannot afford healthcare (<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2017/09/14/mississippi-still-worst-poverty-household-income-u-s/">the state has the highest percentage without health insurance in 2017</a>) and so perhaps it is unsurprising that resident accept subsidized vaccinations that are required in any case for access to childcare and state schools (without the option for home or private schooling where vaccines are not required).</p><h6>Vaccination coverage of children, by US state in 2016/17<a id="ref-39" class="ref" href="#note-39"><sup>39</sup></a>
