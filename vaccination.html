In addition to governments there are a large number of other institutions that contribute to vaccination efforts. These include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), public health institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and more recently the public-private partnership Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance).<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>There is a technical difference between vaccination and immunization, as the National Health Service (NHS)&#xA0;<a href="https://www.shb.scot.nhs.uk/board/publichealth/immunisation.asp">explains</a> &#x201C;Vaccination means having a vaccine &#x2013; that is actually getting the injection, or nasal spray or oral vaccine.

<section><h2>Empirical View</h2><h3>The history of vaccine innovation</h3><p>An early form of vaccination was called inoculation (also referred to as variolation). Practiced in Asia, this was an ancient technique of deliberate infection of smallpox with dried&#xA0;smallpox scabs blown up the nose to expose the person to a mild form of the disease.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> By the 1700s inoculation had spread to Africa, India and the Ottoman Empire, followed by the UK and America, where the method of infection more frequently used was a puncture to the skin.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#xA0;The effectiveness of the inoculation was first widely demonstrated by English physician Edward Jenner in 1796, who conducted an experiment using matter from a cowpox lesion to inoculate his gardener&#x2019;s eight-year-old son James Phipps to protect against smallpox. Two months later Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox lesion matter&#xA0;and when Phipps did not develop smallpox, it showed he was protected against the disease.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> Jenner called the procedure &#x2018;vaccination&#x2019;.</p><p>Following the findings of Jenner as the first scientific attempt to control disease by vaccination, the smallpox vaccine went through many iterations, with the newer vaccines produced by modern cell culture techniques (passing the virus through cell culture makes the vaccine safer). By the middle of the 20th century confidence grew that smallpox could be the first disease eradicated by humankind. In 1967 the WHO launched a <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">global eradication of smallpox program</a>. Mass vaccination of over 80% of a country&apos;s population ensued but people who were nomadic or lived in politically unstable regions posed particular problems. A number of innovations came in the development of foot-powered injector called the <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">&#x201C;ped-o-jet&#x201D; and then the bifurcated needle</a>, which was efficient and cost-effective to use.</p><p>In order to reach large sections of population, epidemiologist <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">William Foege</a> developed Eradication Escalation (E2) to contain smallpox outbreaks during October (the seasonal low point of smallpox transmission where prevention a case could stop a smallpox chain transmission). <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">Other obstacles faced</a> included forcibly vaccinating an Indian religious leader to convince his followers to be vaccinated, negotiation of ceasefires for vaccine transport in war-torn Nigeria, vaccinating in concentric rings around an outbreak, and cash bounties to reward the reporting of smallpox cases. Finally in 1977 the last case of naturally contracted smallpox was reported in Somalia, by Ali Maow Maalin and in 1980 the <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/">WHO announced that smallpox had been eradicated</a>.</p><p>Eradication&#xA0; is the ultimate goal of vaccination against a disease. For other diseases, a vaccine has been less forthcoming. The first visualization below shows a timeline of innovation in the development of vaccines. Each bar begins in the year in which the pathogenic agent was first linked to the disease and the bar ends in the year in which a vaccination against that pathogen was licensed in the US.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14773" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-724x550.png" alt="" width="724" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-150x114.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-400x304.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-724x550.png 724w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vaccination-innovation-chart-768x583.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vaccination-innovation-chart-768x538.png 768w"></a><br>
<!---------------------------></p><p><!---------------------------></p><p>For some diseases it has been a relatively short timespan between when the infectious agent was linked to the disease and a vaccine was developed. The quickest was 10 years for measles, with the agent linked to the disease in 1953 and the vaccine licensed in the U.S. in 1963. <a href="/malaria/">Malaria</a> is proving harder as it has been over 135 years since the agent was linked to the disease. A vaccine is now in development &#x2013; RTS,S is undergoing pilot trials in select countries after being approved by European regulators in 2015.Vaccine innovation has both followed scientific and political-economic developments:</p><ul>
<li>Bacterial culture techniques which were allowed the development of&#xA0;bacterial vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in the early 1900s.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li>The first and second world wars prompted combined efforts by universities, government, and private companies.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>By the 1950s&#xA0;viral tissue culture which were techniques allowed the development of vaccines against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox).</li>
<li>New technologies in molecular biology and advanced chemistry techniques&#xA0;have most recently led to vaccines against hepatitis B, flu, and pneumococcus, which causes meningitis.<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
</ul><h3>Diseases preventable through immunization</h3><p>The most common and serious vaccine-preventable diseases tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) are the following:<a href="/vaccination/?preview_id=1455&amp;preview_nonce=b1565fcadb&amp;_thumbnail_id=14771&amp;preview=true#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><ol>
<li><strong>Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3):</strong> are all bacterial diseases and they are often grouped together as a combination vaccine against all three diseases is commonly used.
<ul>
<li>Diphtheria primarily infects the throat and upper airways and is fatal in 5 &#x2013; 10% of cases.</li>
<li>Tetanus is not passed person-to-person but through spores of a bacteria living in soil and animal intestinal tracts. These bacteria enter the body wounds and release a toxin that affects the nerves, which causes muscle stiffness and spasms.</li>
<li>Pertussis is a highly contagious disease of the respiratory tract. Children who contractpertussis tend to have coughing spells that last four to eight weeks.&#xA0;Vaccinating health workers and pregnant women is the most effective strategy for preventing disease in infants too young to be vaccinated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib):</strong> is a viral infection that causes meningitis and pneumonia transmitted through the respiratory tract from infected to susceptible individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Hepatitis B (hepb):</strong> is a highly contagious viral infection that attacks the liver and is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. As the chart below shows is estimated that about 100,300 people die each year due to consequences of hepatitis B. WHO recommends that all infants should receive their first dose of vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Poliomyelitis (Pol3):</strong> is a highly infectious viral disease. Once the poliovirus invades the nervous system it can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. No cure exists for polio, only treatment to alleviate symptoms. As we detail in our separate entry on polio the world is on its way to eradicate the disease thanks to the vaccine against the virus. While in the 1980s there were 350,000 paralytic cases of polio every year, the world has seen only 42 cases in 2016.</li>
<li><strong>Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR):</strong> are all viral diseases.
<ul>
<li>Measles is a&#xA0;highly contagious killer of young children globally, despite a safe and effective vaccine being available. Around 70,000 people die because of measles every year, the huge majority of which (87%) are children younger than 5.</li>
<li>Mumps infection occurs via direct human contact or by airborne droplets. It causes painful swelling at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), fever, headache and muscle aches.</li>
<li>Rubella is usually mild in children, but infection during early pregnancy may cause fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome, which can lead to defects of the brain, heart, eyes, and ears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meningococcal meningitis (meningitis ACWY)</strong>: can cause severe brain damage and is often deadly. Transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets or secretions. It kills more than 120,000 people every year.</li>
<li><strong>Tuberculosis (TB):</strong> is a bacterial disease transmitted by people infected with pulmonary (lung) TB. The BCG vaccination is only partially effective providing some protection against severe forms of TB in children but is unreliable against adult pulmonary TB. 1.2 million people die because of TB every year.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow fever (YF):</strong> is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. There are 42 countries and territories at risk for yellow fever in Africa and the Americas. In these 42 countries and territories, coverage is estimated at 45%.</li>
</ol><p>The WHO have a larger list of <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/en/">26 diseases</a> for which vaccines are available (including pneumococcal disease, varicella/chicken pox, HPV, Hepatitis A and rotavirus).

One-third of 194 countries have run out of a vaccine for a month or longer <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">(according to data&#xA0;submitted to WHO and UNICEF of average year between 2011 and 2015)</a>&#xA0;and this includes both higher and lower income countries. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided that reasons for shortages as being multi-factoral from, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/clinical-resources/shortages.html">&quot;...companies leaving the vaccine market, manufacturing or production problems, and insufficient stockpiles&quot;.</a>&#xA0;The supplies of vaccines that are critically low include those that target <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">yellow fever, hepatitis B, cholera, meningitis C, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis A, and tuberculosis</a>.</p><p>Concerns about the supply of vaccines in an epidemic or pandemic have been raised. For example, the supply of yellow fever vaccine was limited for the outbreak in Angola in 2016 leading to the recommendation of a fractional dose to extend existing supplies.<a id="ref-4" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-4"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">4</sup></a> <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">Laurie Garrett argues</a> that because the drug had become so cheap (60 cents for each vaccine 2008) few companies wanted to make it) and world stocks of the vaccine was nearing zero, forcing the WHO to dilute donated vaccines from countries like Brazil (which sent 18 million doses) by 5 to 1 with the hope they would still work. Romania experienced a situation of parallel vaccine exports in 2016 where more vaccines were exported than was supplied to meet the country&apos;s needs. A shortage of the&#xA0;measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was partly responsible for the measles outbreak in 2016-17.<a id="ref-5" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-5"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">5</sup></a></p><p>There are five big pharmaceutical companies that account for 80% of vaccine production: Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer, and Novartis.<a id="ref-6" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-6"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">6</sup></a> Many vaccines are only provided by one or two suppliers. For newer vaccines there are often particularly few suppliers due to the high investment needed to develop a vaccine and also having patents attached but this can also lead to high profits. Prevnar, the brand name for the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) was hugely profitable for the pharmaceutical company Wyeth (purchased by Pfizer in 2009), with sales in 2005 of $1.5 billion. One vaccine for tetanus and diphtheria (td) has a large number of suppliers (at 13 and 7 for the paediatric formation).</p><h4><strong>The cost of vaccines</strong></h4><p>The WHO reports that vaccines that are supplied by more suppliers have a more competitive environment and this ultimately drives down prices.<a id="ref-7" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-7"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">7</sup></a></p><p class="p2">As a share of the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-answers-are-out-there-natural-disasters-china-north-korea-corruption-economy/#health">global pharmaceutical market worth over $1 trillion a year, vaccines make up a small proportion of $24 billion or about 2.4 percent</a>.&#xA0;In the past vaccines were often viewed as less profitable treatments for pharma companies, which led to a lack of investment and some companies pulling out of production altogether.<a id="ref-8" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-8"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">8</sup></a> But this changed as the revenue of the global vaccines market has increased and richer country governments and insurance companies have been willing to pay more for new vaccines, growing economies such as India and China are spending more, and poorer countries now have Gavi to help governments pool resources and make advance purchase commitments.<a id="ref-9" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-9"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">9</sup></a> These emerging economies are also able to produce more of their own vaccines. For example the Serum Institute in India is the <a href="https://www.seruminstitute.com/">world&apos;s largest vaccine manufacturer</a> by number of doses produced and sold globally.</p><p>New vaccines tend to be more expensive as they have patents attached.

</table><p>Some vaccines still remain more expensive. For example, the pertussis vaccine either comes in two versions: whole cell (wP) where the whole pertussis organism is contained or acellular (aP) where part of the pertussis organism is contained. The pertussis vaccine is combined with diphtheria and tetanus to produce wither a DTwP or DTaP vaccine. DTaP is more expensive sometimes called &apos;the painless vaccine&apos; because it cause less of a local reaction and pain but should not be given to children over the age of seven. However, DTwP has been shown to prevent the transmission and spread of disease to unvaccinated people and to thos with weak immunity.</p><h3>Vaccination coverage and decline of the disease burden globally</h3><p>We provide detail on three vaccinations: DTP3, measles, and polio. These diseases were the original ones targeted by the WHO for their <em>Expanded Program on Immunization</em> (EPI). Mass vaccination coverage expanded greatly through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). The EPI was initiated by the WHO in 1977 to build on the success of smallpox eradication and the goal was universal immunization. The first diseases targeted by the EPI were diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, polio, and tuberculosis.</p><p><!---------------></p><h4>Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP3) &#x2013; global vaccination coverage and decline of the disease burden</h4><p>The chart below shows the progress over time of DTP3 immunization coverage for children around the world.&#xA0;By clicking on any country you can see the change in that country over time.</p><p>The WHO <a href="/grapher/share-of-children-immunized-dtp3?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL">reports</a> that 86% of infants worldwide (116.5 million infants) received 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine. 130 countries had reached at least 90% coverage with the DTP3 vaccine.<a id="ref-12" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-12"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">12</sup></a> If we look at <a href="/grapher/share-of-children-immunized-dtp3?tab=chart&amp;country=East%20Asia%20%26%20Pacific+Europe%20%26%20Central%20Asia+Latin%20America%20%26%20Caribbean+Middle%20East%20%26%20North%20Africa+North%20America+South%20Asia+Sub-Saharan%20Africa">the change over time by world region</a>&#xA0;it is South Asia in particular that stands out.

Ukraine stands out as having particularly low DTP vaccination rates in 2015 of 23%, falling from 98% in 1999.

<section><h2>Correlates, Determinants, and Consequences</h2><h3>How vaccines work, Herd Immunity and why to care about broad vaccination coverage</h3><p>Vaccines typically cause acquired immunity via some agent inside the vaccine that resembles the disease-causing microorganism. The agent can be made of killed or weakened forms of the microorganism, its toxins or its surface proteins. More information about vaccines in general can be found at the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine">vaccines</a>.</p><p>There is a collective social benefit in more people vaccinating. The greater the share of people who are immunized, the better protected is everyone in the population as the disease transmission can be stopped. Herd immunity is a community protection that is produced when a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, such that it is difficult for infectious diseases that are contagious to spread.<a id="ref-19" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-19"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">19</sup></a></p><p>Herd immunity provides a protective barrier, especially also for those who cannot be vaccinated. These include vulnerable groups such as babies too young to be vaccinated or immune-compromised children who are the first potential victims of low vaccination rates.</p><p>When a person is immune to a disease they can act as a barrier to slow down or prevent the transmission of disease to other people. When the number of people in a population that are immune against a disease is reached, such that a disease no longer persists in the population, this is called the herd immunity threshold (HIT). The table below shows the HIT for several diseases. Measles and pertussis are very contagious airborne diseases and a larger share of people need to be vaccinated to stop the transmission. Because of this these diseases have the highest HIT rates that need to be reached.</p><h6>Herd Immunity Thresholds of vaccine-preventable diseases<a id="ref-20" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-20"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">20</sup></a></h6><p><table class="tablepress"><thead><tr><th>Disease</th><th>Transmission</th><th>Basic reproduction number</th><th>Herd Immunity Threshold</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr><td>Measles</td><td>Airborne</td><td>12&#x2013;18</td><td>92&#x2013;95%</td></tr><tr><td>Pertussis</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>12&#x2013;17</td><td>92&#x2013;94%</td></tr><tr><td>Diphtheria</td><td>Saliva</td><td>6&#x2013;7</td><td>83&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Rubella</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>6&#x2013;7</td><td>83&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Smallpox</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>5&#x2013;7</td><td>80&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Polio</td><td>Fecal-oral route</td><td>5&#x2013;7</td><td>80&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>Mumps</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>4&#x2013;7</td><td>75&#x2013;86%</td></tr><tr><td>SARS</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>2&#x2013;5</td><td>50&#x2013;80%</td></tr><tr><td>Ebola</td><td>Bodily fluids</td><td>1.5&#x2013;2.5</td><td>33&#x2013;60%</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza</td><td>Airborne droplet</td><td>1.5&#x2013;1.8</td><td>33&#x2013;44%</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><!----------------></p><h3>Determining impact: Why do vaccine schedules differ and what is the effect of vaccination compared with better hygiene?</h3><h4>The chickenpox example</h4><p>Chickenpox&#xA0;(varicella) is an example of a vaccine that some countries adopt into their routine childhood vaccination schedules, while others do not. The question that follows is why there is a difference in opinion for introducing widespread uptake of a vaccine or not. Japan was one of the first countries to adopt universal chickenpox vaccination.<a id="ref-21" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-21"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">21</sup></a></p><p>Most European countries do not vaccinate against chickenpox, except for &apos;at risk&apos; groups. The main reason for not adopting universal vaccination is the high cost. An additional supporting justifications are that it is usually a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1032.aspx?CategoryID=62">mild disease</a> and the&#xA0;benefit of less cases of shingles &#x2013; as explained <a href="https://theconversation.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chickenpox-and-why-more-countries-dont-use-the-vaccine-63473">here</a>.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US ran&#xA0;the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/surveillance/vasp.html">Varicella Active Surveillance Project</a> (VASP)&#xA0;from 1995 through to 2010 to monitor the&#xA0;impact of the varicella vaccination program and the key finding is shown in the chart below. The coverage of the vaccine in&#xA0;Los Angeles County, rose from 37.9% in 1997 to 95.1% in 2010 and in Philadelphia from 41.2% in 1997, to 94.6% in 2010&#xA0;(one-dose vaccinations for children between 19 and 35 months of age). By 2010, varicella incidence declined 98% in Antelope Valley (California) and West Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) compared with 1995. Outbreaks and hospitalizations also decreased rapidly. From 1995 to 1998, hospitalization rates ranged from 2.2 to 3.3 per 100,000 population but by 2006-2010, this had declined to 0.2 per 100,000 in Antelope Valley and 0.5 per 100,000 in Philadelphia.</p><p>Chickenpox can also help to answer the question of whether better hygiene or the vaccination are in fact responsible for the reduced rates of disease. Although both are important, a more recently adopted vaccination such as chickenpox can demonstrate the effects of vaccination in reducing the rate of disease after the importance of hygiene was discovered and became a preventative measure against disease. The impact on disease rates demonstrate it is not hygiene, but vaccination that reduced chickenpox so dramatically in the US.</p><h6>Chickenpox incidence in two counties in the US, 2000-2010<a id="ref-22" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-22"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">22</sup></a><p></p>

</h6><h3>People who are not vaccinating</h3><h4>Impact of vaccine resistance and controversies on coverage and disease outbreaks</h4><p>Anti-vaccination opposition is as old as mass vaccination itself. The original anti-vaccination organisation &apos;Anti-compulsory Vaccination League&apos; was established in the UK in 1866 as a protest against smallpox vaccination mandates.&#xA0; In the late 1880s and 1900s opposition to vaccines in the U.S was organised through the &apos;Anti-Vaccination League of America&apos; and the &apos;American Medical Liberty League&apos;.<a id="ref-23" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-23"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">23</sup></a> At that time resistance could be attributed to concern about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, which were an unregulated industry along with a dislike for the extension of state powers.</p><p>Since then, vaccine resistance in both higher and lower income countries has been attributed to a mixture of reasons including safety concerns to suspcion of state power. In higher income countries a number of controversies have arisen due to fear and uncertainty about side effects. In the 1970s and 1980s the DPT vaccine was questioned in connection with permanent brain injury or encephalopathy, but studies would show no connection. In the late 1990s and early 2000s MMR was connected with bowel symptoms and autism by a 1998 paper authored by Andrew Wakefield and others. The paper was later retracted by the journal (The Lancet) and Wakefield struck off the UK medical register after results were found to be fraudulent.<a id="ref-24" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-24"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">24</sup></a></p><p>In lower income countries examples of opposition can be seen in worries about government powers. In&#xA0;Channai (Madras) India the 1950s, oppostion to BCG vaccination was a regional push-back to the will of nationalist and outside post-colonial forces.<a id="ref-25" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-25"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">25</sup></a></p><p>Resistance to polio vaccination in some majority Muslim countries has also been attributed partly to underlying political reasons. There are only three countries that have never been able to stop the transmission of polio: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. Jonathan Kennedy and Domna Michailidou <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/islamist-polio-vaccination-opposition-by-jonathan-kennedy-and-domna-michailidou-2015-10?barrier=accessreg">explain</a> some of the political dynamics behind <a href="/grapher/polio-vaccine-coverage-of-one-year-olds?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL+NGA+AFG+PAK">the low vaccination rates in Nigeria and Pakistan</a>. In Nigeria the opposition to the vaccine reflected political shifts where a majority Muslim population in the North feared the intervention of the newly appointed Christian majority government. In Pakistan Pashtun communities resist the expansion of the Pakistani state and Pakistani Taliban hostility was fueled by the fake hepatitis vaccination campaign led by the CIA to try to gather DNA to help find Osama Bin Laden. In Afghanistan it appears that supply problems persist in a post-conflict country.<a id="ref-26" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-26"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">26</sup></a></p><p><strong>Results from the&#xA0;<em>Vaccine Confidence Project</em></strong></p><p>To view vaccination beliefs and attitudes on a global scale across countries, researchers at the <em>Vaccine Confidence Project</em> have begun to measure skepticism of vaccination.</p><p>The world map shows in most countries the huge majority considers vaccines to be safe. But in some countries &#x2013; several former Soviet countries, France, and Japan &#x2013; a substantial share of the population disagrees. In France 41% of the population does not consider vaccinations safe. In other countries the share&#xA0;that is of the same opinion is smaller than 10% (in Bangladesh only 0.2%).</p><p>We have produced several graphs that show the share of people who view vaccination as:&#xA0;&quot;<a href="/grapher/share-that-disagrees-that-vaccines-are-effective">effective</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="/grapher/share-disagrees-vaccines-are-important-for-children-to-have">important for children to have</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="/grapher/share-that-disagrees-vaccines-compatible-with-their-religious-beliefs">compatible with their religious beliefs</a>&quot;.<a id="ref-27" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-27"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">27</sup></a></p><p>Beliefs and attitudes do not translate straightforwardly into behaviour. Even for countries where a large share of respondents had a high level of skepticism of the safety of vaccination, <a href="/grapher/perception-of-the-safety-of-vaccines-vs-vaccine-coverage">coverage rates could remain high</a>.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/share-that-disagrees-that-vaccines-are-safe" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-that-disagrees-that-vaccines-are-safe_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/share-that-disagrees-that-vaccines-are-safe"></div></a></div></p><p><!----------------></p><h4>Historical legacy often determines whether vaccinations are compulsory</h4><p>Countries vary in whether vaccination is compulsory, required (according to specific mandates), or voluntary. Which policy is taken has depended much on historical legacy, which becomes clear when one considers some of the different regulations and their history around the world:</p><p><em>Compulsory vaccination:</em> Many Eastern Bloc countries introduced compulsory vaccination during the communist era. Vaccination was previously compulsory in Romania for example and after a drop in vaccination rates the country is going through the process of reintroducing compulsory vaccination. The same is true for Italy and also France, which had compulsory vaccination for three diseases but increased this number to 11 in 2017/8 in response to a drop in vaccination rates.</p><p><em>Vaccine requirements</em> <em>and mandates:</em> The US has mandates for vaccination where vaccination is required to enter state school or daycare. An early case in the US paved the way for state jurisdiction to protect public health in light of personal liberty.<a id="ref-28" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-28"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">28</sup></a> In Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905) the Supreme Court ruled that states have the authority to require vaccination against smallpox during a smallpox epidemic. Since then the United States has had a history of school vaccination requirements. The increased number of children in public schools as a result of the compulsory school attendance law led to an increased risk of smallpox outbreaks, through close contact in large crowded classrooms.<a id="ref-29" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-29"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">29</sup></a> Similarly in Australia two policies penalize parents for not vaccinating their children. The &apos;No jab no play&apos; policy removed state-sponsored childcare. The 2016 &apos;No jab no pay&apos; policy removes state welfare by not providing the universal &apos;Family Allowance&apos; welfare payments for parents who are conscientious objectors of vaccination.</p><p><em>Voluntary vaccination:</em> Some countries where vaccination is voluntary had early pushback against vaccination, as with the UK and the Netherlands. In 1853 a law was passed in England and Wales requiring universal vaccination against smallpox, but opposition from anti-vaccinationists led to laws being passed to allow for conscientious objection.<a id="ref-30" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-30"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">30</sup></a></p><p><em>Vaccination for country entry:</em> For countries in Africa and South America where yellow fever is endemic or where the mosquito vector is present a certificate of proof of vaccination is required. Only then will the country issue a visa upon entry to that country to prevent importation of these disease (particularly if travellers come from, or have visited yellow fever endemic areas).<a id="ref-31" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-31"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">31</sup></a> In recent years governments have acted in response to epidemics to make vaccinations compulsory, as we have seen for 2017-18 with compulsory vaccinations in France, Italy, Germany, and Romania.</p><p>One country where we can see variation in vaccination policy and the effects this has in the US. In the US states decide on what exemptions are allowed for the mandate for children to receive vaccinations to access education and daycare. The reasons for such laws in the first place came with a free, public education system, which also unfortunately meant schools became sites of epidemics for childhood diseases. Exemptions are granted for medical reasons but many states also allow for philosophical, personal belief or religious exemptions. Only three states &#x2013; Mississippi, West Virginia, and California &#x2013; only allow for medical exemption. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-10-at-15.31.35.png">Californian immunization rates have increased</a> following a new Senate Bill SB 277 in 2015 to remove non-medical exemptions to vaccination. We can see on the chart below that there is not a strong correlation between stricter requirements for vaccination (i.e. only allowing for medical exemptions).

</h6><h3>Prosperity and vaccination coverage</h3><p>Shown below is the correlation of vaccine coverage against the level of prosperity of a country. The vaccine coverage against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus is a good marker of strength in a country&#x2019;s immunization programmes since several administrations are required. Rich countries have vaccination coverage rates of more than 90%.</p><p>Countries in which a large share of the population is living in extreme poverty often &#x2013; but not always &#x2013; have lower immunization rates, as <a href="/grapher/vaccination-coverage-DPT-by-extreme-poverty?endpointsOnly=0">this chart shows</a>.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/vaccination-coverage-by-income-in" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/vaccination-coverage-by-income-in_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/vaccination-coverage-by-income-in"></div></a></div></p><p><!----------------><br>

Throughout the 18th and 19th century, yellow fever was among the most feared diseases in the ports of the Old and New World.

<h4>Does it work to make vaccinations compulsory?</h4>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">This was previously your title for the previous section. Currently the question isn't answered. Would be cool to answer! But if that is too much for an entry then we would still need a discussion of the following chart on US states.</span>

Whether compulsory vaccination results in improved vaccination rates is not a straightforward question to tackle because it is highly dependant on country context (reasons for compulsory vaccination), historical circumstance, cultural and social norms, as well as the practicalities of implementing and enforcing such a law. Certainly in <a href="https://theconversation.com/despite-scepticism-europe-has-high-vaccination-rates-but-it-shouldnt-be-complacent-75169">Eastern Bloc countries</a> whether vaccination was compulsory vaccination rates have been high but it is unclear whether to attribute this to the law or the behaviours and mechanisms of compliance under communist rule. Certain vaccinations have historically been compulsory such as smallpox, polio, and yellow fever. Here vaccination rates have also been high but it has also encouraged organised opposition to vaccination and public discontent. This is a major worry of public health authorities that a relationship of trust, between governments and citizens is threatened (particularly for health where a rhetoric of self-responsibility, personalisation, and choice is encouraged). There are countries with high vaccination rates without compulsory vaccination and governments do not want to disrupt public trust and self-responsibility by making vaccination compulsory, particularly if it is not seen as needed. It has been argued that high coverage has been achieved through "other approaches or efforts" and so acceptance of compulsory vaccination might be problematic in countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK.[ref]Salmon, Daniel A et al., Compulsory vaccination and conscientious or philosophical exemptions: past, present, and future, The Lancet , Volume 367 , Issue 9508 , 436 - 442</p></div></li><li id="note-32" style="margin-top: 0px;" class="side-matter side-matter-note"><div class="side-matter side-matter-text"><p>The data source for vaccination coverage: School Vaccination Assessment Report, 2016-17 school year.</h6>
Estimated vaccination coverage with 5 doses of Childhood Diphtheria toxoid, Tetanus toxoid, acellular Pertussis (DTaP) vaccination for kindergartners (typical age range is 4–6 years).

The data source for exemptions is: Immunization Action Coalition, "Exemptions Permitted for State Immunization Requirements," 2017; LexisNexis; StateNet 2017

Regarding the school vaccination coverage and exemption methods the source notes: "Each school year, school nurses, other school personnel, or health department personnel check the vaccination and exemption status of kindergartners enrolled in public and private schools as required by state law or regulation. State and local immunization programs measure vaccination coverage among children entering kindergarten annually. This may be done for every student or for a sample of students.

State and local areas set the vaccination requirements. Immunization information systems (IISs) may be used as one source of data for school vaccination assessment. The school-level data are reported to the health department. The aggregate data are reported to CDC for public and private schools. Data for home-schooled students are not routinely reported to CDC.

The types of permitted exemptions vary by state.
