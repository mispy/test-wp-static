Taking these two time series together makes it possible to estimate how many children a woman on average lost before the children were five years old.<br>
Below you see the data for Sweden which is one of the country for which we have the best historical data, the Swedish office for population statistics <em>Tabellverket</em> was founded as early as 1749.<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a> The visualization shows that throughout most of the 19th century Swedish women gave birth to more than 4 children. As we have shown in the <a href="/child-mortality/">Our World In Data-entry on child mortality</a>, in 19th century Sweden 1 out of 4 children died before its 5th birthday: This means that fertility and child mortality were so high that on average <em> every</em> woman lost 1 of her children before they could celebrate their 5th birthday.</p><p>With the decline of child mortality and fertility this became very rare. In 2015 Swedish women lost on average 0.006 children before they were 5 years old.</p><p>In this visualization you can change the country for which this time-series is visualized to explore the trends in countries around the world. To <em>compare</em> the number of children lost per woman for several countries &#x2013; and see the data on a world map &#x2013; you can use <a href="/grapher/children-died-before-five-per-woman">this visualisation</a>.</p><p>The data shown in this visualization is calculated based on the historical estimates of fertility and child mortality presented at <a href="http://gapminder.org">Gapminder.org</a> (see the sources tab in the chart for more information); particularly for the early period data coverage is not as good as one wishes and it should be understood that the presented estimates are coming with a considerable uncertainty.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/Children-woman-death-vs-survival" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/Children-woman-death-vs-survival_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/Children-woman-death-vs-survival"></div></a></div></p></section>
