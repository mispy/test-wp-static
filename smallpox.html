<section><h2>History</h2><ul>
<li>How many people ever died of smallpox</li>
<li>Since when do we think is it around?
<ul>
<li>Because smallpox infects only humans, the variola virus only survives if it continuously finds human hosts -&gt; infected humans either develop immunity or die. Egypt hosted one was of the earliest concentrations of civilisation along its river Nile, which makes it a likely candidate for the origin of various infectious diseases, including smallpox.</li>
<li>Probably derived from an &quot;ancestral African rodent-borne variola-like virus either 16,000 or 68,000 years before present&quot;<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a></li>
<li>Medical writings in ancient China (1122BC) and India (1500BC) refer to smallpox already. Other countries did not have literature at that stage yet, so we cannot know whether the origin of the disease is East / South Asia.<a id="ref-2" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-2"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">2</sup></a></li>
<li>Striking absence from Old and New Testament and from Greek and Roman literature</li>
<li>The Egyptian practice of mummification preserved the skin, bones and muscles of royal figures in their dynasties. Three mummies were found with &apos;dome-shaped vesicles [...] similar to those found in smallpox&apos;<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a>. One of these bodies was Pharaoh&#xA0;Ramses V who died in 1157BC. A reconstruction of his face is shown below which clearly shows small pustules, especially on his cheeks. At the time of the mummy&apos;s discovery, electron microscopy was not yet available unfortunately and authorities have not allowed investigators to extract tissue from the mummies since then.</li>
<li><em>Unmistakable</em> descriptions of smallpox not until 4th century AD China and 7th century in India and Mediterranean, 10th century in South-Western Asia <a id="ref-4" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-4"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">4</sup></a> These authors describe smallpox as a disease of children which shows that the disease went from epidemic (only causing trouble when imported) to endemic (populations were large enough that the virus could have an undisrupted presence)</li>
<li>Documentation of spread to Ethiopia during the &quot;Elephant War&quot; in 568AD and Europe, e.g. playing a major role in the &quot;Plague of Athens&quot; in 430BC during the Peloponnesian Wars as described by Thucydides</li>
<li>Asia also infected very early</li>
<li>Australia, South Africa and the Americas were only exposed with the onset of colonisation in the 16th century -&gt; Figure 5.5 below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introducing smallpox in the Americas shows what happens to a completely unexposed population -&gt; link to potential biological warfare if smallpox was reintroduced these days!</li>
<li>Hall of fame of people who suffered / died from smallpox (history written)</li>
<li>Lady Mary Wortley Montague who lobbied for live variolation</li>
<li>Edward Jenner
<ul>
<li>1749-1823, inoculated with smallpox at the age of 8 and locked into &quot;inoculation stable&quot; until the disease had run its course<a id="ref-5" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-5"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">5</sup></a></li>
<li>He became a surgeon (and later a physician) so one of his tasks were smallpox inoculation. He observed that people who had suffered from cowpox had only a very mild, if at all visible reaction to being inoculated with smallpox. Because he depended on cowpox and smallpox incidences in his area, it was not until 14 May 1796 that he inoculated a boy with cowpox and on 1 July with smallpox. When the boy did not develop smallpox symptoms, he continued his research trials until he eventually tried to submit his paper to&#xA0;<em>Philosophical Transactions</em> edited by the Royal Society. They rejected his paper and advised him to not pursue his ideas any further due to the high stakes it would mean for his career and reputation. Undeterred, he published his work with an increased number of trials at his own expense two years later in 1798.</li>
<li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Raised attention and lots of people became vaccinated?</span></li>
<li>Believed to be the foundation of immunology</li>
<li>In 1806, US president Thomas Jefferson thanked Edward Jenner for his discovery and famously predicted &quot;Future generations will know by history only that the loathsome smallpox existed and by you has been extirpated.&quot;<a id="ref-6" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-6"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">6</sup></a></li>
