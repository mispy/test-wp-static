The findings tells us, among other important things, that networks tend to be selective in their coverage in a way that does not adequately account for the severity and number of people killed or affected by a natural disaster.<br>

Thanks to this selectivity, less &quot;spectacular&quot; but often times more deadly natural disasters tend to get passed over. <a href="/famines/">Food shortages</a>, for example, result in the most casualties and affect the most people per incident<a id="ref-5" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-5"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">5</sup></a> but their onset is more gradual than that of a volcanic explosion or sudden earthquake. As a result, food shortages are covered only 3% of the time while a comparatively indulgent 30% of earthquakes and volcanic events get their time in the spotlight. Additionally, when the researchers &#x201C;hold all else equal&#x201D; by controlling for factors such as yearly trends in news intensity and the number of people killed and affected, the difference in coverage is even more pronounced. This bias for the spectacular is not only unfair and misleading, but also has the potential to misallocate attention and aid. Disasters that happen in an instant leave little time for preventative intervention. On the other hand, the gradual disasters that tend to affect more lives build up slowly, allowing more time for preventative measures to be taken. However, in a Catch-22 situation, the gradual nature of these calamities is also what prevents them from garnering the media attention they deserve.</p><p>There are other biases, too. Eisensee and Str&#xF6;mberg found that while television networks cover more than 15% of the disasters in Europe and South Central America, they show less than 5% of the disasters in Africa and the Pacific. Disasters in Africa tend to get less coverage than ones in Asia because they are less &quot;spectacular&quot;, with more droughts and food shortages occurring there relative to Asia. However, after controlling for disaster type, along with other factors such as the number killed and the timing of the news, there is no significant difference between coverage of African and Asian disasters. Instead, a huge difference emerges between coverage of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific on the one hand, and Europe and South and Central America, on the other. According to the researchers&#x2019; estimates, 45 times as many people would have to die in an African disaster for it to garner the same media attention as a European one. The visualizations below illustrate this bias.</p><p>ABC News&#x2019;s slogan is &#x201C;See the whole picture&#x201D; and CNN&#x2019;s is &#x201C;Go there&#x201D;, but good follow-up questions might be: what exactly, and where?<br>
