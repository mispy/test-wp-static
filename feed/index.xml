				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.<br />
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Children&#8217;s Rights</a></strong>.</div>
<ul>
<li>Child maltreatment is common and takes many forms. From <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/#violent-discipline">physical or emotional abuse</a>, to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/">child labor</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/violence-against-rights-for-children/#child-marriage-and-female-genital-mutilation">other practices that violate their most basic rights</a>.</li>
<li>Violence against children, at home, schools, or in the broader society, affects educational outcomes. It affects whether children are able to attend and remain in school, as well as whether they make progress in terms of learning outcomes. And at the same time, educational outcomes affect violence – education has been identified as a tool to reduce violence against children.</li>
<li>In this post we focus on the importance of child maltreatment specifically in the context of children&#8217;s education and give an overview of the empirical evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Child Labor</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/#definitions-and-measurement">Child labor constitutes in most situations a violation of children&#8217;s rights,</a> as it is often linked to several forms of abuse and harm. Specifically in the context of education, child labor is often linked to poor educational outcomes. The following visualization, from Schultz and Strauss (2008), shows evidence for this. It plots school attendance rates for children aged 10–14 years olds, against total hours worked in the last week (by type of work) with 95 percent confidence intervals (labeled CI and plotted in lighter shades).</p>
<p>Children who work more hours tend to attend school less frequently. And the steepest segments of the pictured curves are in the range 20-45 hours, which suggests — as one would naturally expect — that it is most difficult for a child to attend school when approaching full-time work. </p>
<p>This evidence also shows that there is no significant difference between children engaged in domestic or marketed work.</p>
<h6>School Attendance vs. Hours Worked &#8211; Schultz and Strauss (2008) <br />
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork.png"><img class="wp-image-7074 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork-400x281.png" alt="School Attendance vs. Hours Worked, from Eric V. Edmonds &quot;Child Labor&quot;, Chapter 57 in T. Paul Schultz, John Strauss (2008), Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 4. North Holland." width="400" height="281" srcset="http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork-400x281.png 400w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork-150x105.png 150w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork-768x540.png 768w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork-750x527.png 750w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ourworldindata_schoolvswork.png 842w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></h6>
<p>The chart above shows the relationship between school attendance and hours worked using <em>micro</em> data, which means that the authors investigate the relationship across <em>individual</em> households. A similar pattern can also be seen in the data if we look at the corresponding country-level macro variables: In countries where children tend to work longer hours, it is more common that working children remain out of school. The interactive chart below shows this by plotting country-level average hours worked by children against share of working children who are out of school.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/working-children-out-of-school-ages-7-14-vs-hours-worked-by-children-ages-7-14" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>These correlations on the micro and macro level are of course not enough to establish a causal relationship. There are many potential economic and cultural factors that simultaneously influence both schooling and work decisions; and in any case, the direction of the relationships is not obvious—do children work because they are not attending school, or do they fail to attend school because they are working?</p>
<p>A number of academic studies have tried to investigate whether there is indeed a causal relationship by attempting to find a factor (an ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation">instrumental variable</a>’) that only affects whether a child works without affecting how the family values other uses of the child’s time. These studies – like Rosati &amp; Rossi 2003 or Gunnarsson, Orazem &amp; Sanchez 2006) – suggest that there is indeed a causal relationship: work often does determine whether a child remains in, or drops out of, school.</p>
<p><strong>Physical and psychological abuse</strong></p>
<p>Children who are victims of physical or psychological abuse tend to have worse educational outcomes; and while evidence supporting a causal link is scarce, it is important to pay attention to these correlations.</p>
<p>A recent study used detailed household surveys from South Africa and Malawi to document the prevalence of violent discipline and subsequent changes in school progress among the affected children. The study found that children who were exposed to psychological and physical violence for discipline were more likely to have dropped out of school upon follow-up (Sherr et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Other studies have found that violence against children also correlates with poor educational outcomes in the long run. In rich countries, for example, studies have found that individuals who are exposed to sexual and physical abuse in childhood are more likely to drop out of college (Boden et al. 2007 and Duncan 2000).</p>
<p>These correlations also extend to other forms of violence and other types of educational outcomes. Within schools, for instance, violence between children tends to go together with poor learning outcomes. The following chart provides an example of this correlation. It shows, for a number of countries, the percentage of grade 8 students scoring above the low international benchmark in the TIMSS mathematics test, by their involvement in physical fights in school. Numeracy results were consistently higher among children not involved in physical fights in school.</p>

<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13851" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS-750x301.png" alt="" width="750" height="301" srcset="http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS-750x301.png 750w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS-150x60.png 150w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS-400x161.png 400w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS-768x308.png 768w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/UNESCO-2016-School-Fights-TIMSS.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>Physical and psychological abuse are often linked to negative effects on mental and physical health. For example, it has been documented that anxiety and depression tend to arise more frequently among children who are abused. Again, these correlations do not imply causation. But there are good reasons to take them seriously. The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Development Report (2018)</a> notes that toxic stress in the early years can undermine lifelong health, learning, and behavior, because the hormones associated with the fight-or-flight response, such as cortisol, can inhibit physical growth and the children’s susceptibility to illness. It is also the case that these hormones can impair the development of neural connections in parts of the brain that are critical for learning.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the type of brain development problems that scientists attribute to sensory neglect in early childhood. The source is Perry (2002). The CT scan on the left is an image from a healthy three year old with a typical head size (at the 50th percentile of the distribution). The image on the right is from a three year old child suffering from &#8216;severe sensory-deprivation neglect&#8217; – minimal exposure to language, touch, and social interactions. The brain of the child on the right is significantly smaller than average (3rd percentile) and has signs of deterioration (cortical atrophy).</p>
<p>Of course, this comparison is just an illustration, and it is hard to know with certainty whether the observed differences in brain size can be fully attributed to sensory-deprivation neglect. However, Perry finds that the average head size among a group of 40 children who had suffered sensory neglect is below the 5th percentile in the distribution – and while some recovery in brain-size was observed after children were removed from the neglectful environment, in most cases the gaps remained significant.</p>
<p>These findings are relevant to education because brain malleability is much greater earlier in life, and brain development is sequential and cumulative; which means that brain deterioration can lead to permanent impairments on skill acquisition.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback loops</strong></p>
<p>The interaction between violence and education operates in both directions, which means education can be used as an instrument to reduce the prevalence of violence. In Uganda, for example, a programme that provided life skills and vocational training for girls who had been forced into sexual acts, led to substantially fewer of these girls being victims of sexual abuse – an impact largely attributed to acquired skills (Bandiera et al. 2017).</p>
<p>Similarly, parenting interventions that promote skills and knowledge among parents have shown positive effects on domestic violence. In Liberia, for example, a program that provided training in positive parenting and non-violent behaviour reduced violent punishment drastically (Sim et al. 2014).</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>
<p>Evidence from a range of countries shows that there is a correlation between violence against children and educational outcomes. These correlations are strong and hold for different forms of victimization. In some cases there is evidence of causal relationships; but even in contexts where causality is not clear, these correlations are important because they show that different forms of hardship often converge on some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.<br />
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/">Energy Production &amp; Changing Energy Sources</a>.</div>
<p>Discussions about energy and electricity can be confusing. Often, the root of this confusion lies in the choice of units and scale. Firstly, units are often quoted inconsistently: we switch between watt-hours, kilograms of oil equivalent, joules, and even more confusingly, units of power. Secondly, we begin quoting big numbers in the order of millions and billions without a sense of scale: is the unit equivalent to one, ten, or one hundred coal-fired power stations? Thirdly, we lose perspective on the equivalence between electrical energy production and consumption: how many people could a wind or solar farm provide for?</p>
<p>To make our full data entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources/">Energy Production &amp; Changing Energy Sources</a> as useful and clear as possible, we have standardized all of our energy data into a single energy unit: the watt-hour (Wh). The only variation on the watt-hour which we have used is in scaling large numbers into kilowatt, megawatt or gigawatt-hours (which are one thousand, million, and billion watt-hours, respectively). The base unit of the watt-hour, however, remains consistent. This should help to reduce confusion for the first of the three reasons described above.</p>
<p>To address the latter two challenges we have produced the chart shown below, which aims to provide a sense of scale for both electricity production and consumption [<strong>clicking on this chart offers a pop-out version, for which some finer aspects can be more easily read</strong>]. It is comprised of two scales: electricity production and electricity consumption. On the left-hand side we have a chart which extends from zero up to 100,000 MWh. The individual arrows represent the daily electrical outputs of different plant types; as we see, there is a large range of outputs depending on the size and conditions of the specific facility. The average daily output of specific power plants (some of which you may recognize) are shown and labelled as individual stars.</p>
<p>The labeled horizontal lines on these charts aim to give a sense of perspective on electricity consumption levels across the world. For example, in the chart below a very large hydro or nuclear plant could produce enough electricity to meet the demands of 100 million people in Ghana; a large hydro, nuclear, or coal plant could provide for 10 million average global citizens, and average-sized plant would meet demands of ten million in Brazil.</p>
<p>The left-hand chart is dominated by hydropower, nuclear, coal and geothermal production. The output of onshore and offshore wind, and solar photovoltaic (PV) farms currently lie below 10,000 MWh per day, which you see at the bottom of the left-hand chart. The right-hand chart provides a magnification of the bottom section of this chart, extending only from zero to 10,000 MWh. Just as in the left-hand chart, the range of daily electricity outputs from wind and solar PV farms are shown by the arrows, with specific farms represented by stars. Again, we have provided a sense of perspective on how this relates to electricity consumption needs across a range of countries using the labeled horizontal lines.</p>
<p>The data used in these charts are not perfect; we have attempted to provide a global-level overview of a range of electrical energy production sources and average levels of consumption across countries. These figures are based on a number of assumptions and calculations which are explained in detail below. Despite these limitations, we hope these charts are of value in providing an overall sense of scale for both production and consumption.</p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15070" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01.png" alt="" width="12976" height="9676" srcset="http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01.png 12976w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01-150x112.png 150w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01-400x298.png 400w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01-768x573.png 768w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Energy-Units-01-738x550.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 12976px) 100vw, 12976px" /></a></p>
<h2>Data sources for electrical energy production and consumption chart</h2>
<p>Explanation of the assumptions and calculations involved in the derivation of the figures used in the charts above are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Electrical energy production</h3>
<p>Figures on the daily output from different electricity sources have been derived in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where specific reported details on the annual energy output of a plant or facility have been published, we have converted this to a daily average output in watt-hours or megawatt-hours.</li>
<li>Where specific details on electrical output are not available, we have calculated this based on a plant&#8217;s maximum power rating and the average capacity factor for a plant of its type, based on capacity factor data published by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) (described below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of electric power facilities are often described in terms of their maximum capacity; this is a metric of power (not energy), measured in watts (W). There are two conversions we need to make to this metric to derive the average electrical energy daily output. First, we have to convert power into energy. Energy is a measure of power output over time (energy = power x time). So to calculate energy output in watt-hours we have to multiply our power rating by the number of hours our plant is running. For example, if we have a 1000MW plant, its maximum energy output in a day would be 24,000MWh (1000MW x 24 hours).</p>
<p>However, this assumes that a plant runs continuously at maximum output, which most (if not all) don&#8217;t. The second correction we have to make is to multiply this output by its capacity factor. The capacity factor is defined as the actual electrical energy output as a percentage or ratio of the maximum possible output over a given time period. For example, if our plant only operates at 80% (through a combination of shut-down episodes and periods of operating below maximum capacity), our daily energy production would only be 19,200MWh per day (24,000MWh x 80%).</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does a hydropower plant produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>Hydropower production is unique from the perspective that it covers the largest range of electrical energy outputs; ranging from the largest production facilities in the world, down to so-called &#8220;<a href="https://energypedia.info/wiki/Pico_Hydro_Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pico hydro</a>&#8221; schemes—simple water turbines which are often installed for a single household or cluster of households. xThese typically have a power rating of less than 5kW, producing less than one MWh per day (only about <a href="https://www.renewablesfirst.co.uk/hydropower/hydropower-learning-centre/how-much-energy-could-i-generate-from-a-hydro-turbine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 MWh per year</a>).</p>
<p>A collection of the world&#8217;s largest hydro stations can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Brazil&#8217;s Itaipu Dam, and China&#8217;s Three Gorges Dam—the two largest electricity producers in the world—are key outliers with regards to output, producing almost double that of the third largest hydro facility. These two sites are represented as stars, with Itaipu Dam producing a daily average of 282,000 MWh (103 TWh per year/365 days), and the Three Gorges Dam produced an average of 270,000 MWh per day in 2014 (98.8 TWh/365). The other single hydro site shown in this chart is the USA&#8217;s Hoover Dam, which produced a daily average of 11,000 MWh in 2014 (4 TWh/365).</p>
<p>Aside from the hydro outliers of the Itaipu and Three Gorges Dam, the cluster of the largest hydropower facilities achieve an annual output between 50-55 TWh. As a daily average (although seasonal variability will inevitably influence daily outputs throughout the year), large hydropower facilities produce approximately 150,000 MWh per day.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does a nuclear plant produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>Output from nuclear power stations is typically more stable over time than output from hydropower or other renewable resources because they are less influenced by seasonal or environmental variations. To estimate the range of typical daily outputs from nuclear stations, we have utilized the reported maximum capacity of specific stations listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> with the average capacity factor of nuclear power, which is approximately 90%.</p>
<p>For example, the world&#8217;s largest operating nuclear station is Canada&#8217;s Bruce station, with a maximum capacity of 6,384 MW. The estimated average daily output is therefore calculated as 6,384 MW x 90% x 24 hours, which gives us approximately 138,000 MWh per day. The average daily output of the other nuclear stations highlighted here have been calculated using exactly the same methodology.</p>
<p>Small nuclear stations have a maximum capacity of around 400 MW, but can be as small as 200-250 MW. Reactors at India&#8217;s Kaiga Atomic Power Station, for example, have a maximum capacity of 220 MW. As a result, the Kaiga Atomic facility produces on average 6100 MWh per day.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does a coal plant produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>Like nuclear, our estimates of daily electrical output from coal-fired power stations have been calculated based on reported maximum capacity figures, found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coal_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and an average capacity factor of 64%. The largest operating coal plant in the world is the Tiachung Power Plant in Taiwan; with a maximum capacity of 5500 MW, average daily output would be approximately 85,000 MWh (5,500MW * 64% * 24 hours).</p>
<p>Like nuclear production, small coal-fired plants can have a maximum capacity as low as hundreds of MW. The Kahone Thermal Power Station in Senegal, for example, has a capacity of only 102 MW. If we assume an average capacity factor of around 64%, daily output for coal can be as low as 1600 MWh per day.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does a geothermal plant produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>The capacity and production of geothermal energy tends to be lower than that of hydro, nuclear and coal-powered stations. The largest geothermal producer in the world is The Geysers site in the USA; with a capacity of 1,517 MW and reported capacity factor of 63%, we calculate estimated daily output to be approximately 23,000 MWh.</p>
<p>However, if we look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geothermal_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of geothermal plants</a> across the world, The Geysers site is a large outlier in terms of potential output. The second largest geothermal plant has roughly half the installed capacity as The Geysers. If we take its installed capacity of 820 MW and assume Bloomberg New Energy Finance&#8217;s global average capacity factor for geothermal of 73%, we approximate a typical large geothermal plant to produce roughly 14,000-15,000 MWh per day. Like hydropower, geothermal sites can also exist at a very small-scale; Italy&#8217;s San Martino geothermal site has a capacity of only 40 MW; if we assume an average capacity factor of 73% for geothermal, average daily output would be around 700 MWh.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does an onshore wind farm produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>Whilst the majority of onshore wind farms produce less than 10,000 MWh per day on average, the Gansu Wind Farm in China is a notable outlier. With an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu_Wind_Farm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed capacity</a> of 7,965 MW and average capacity factor of 12.4% for wind power in the Gansu region, we estimate daily output to be around 24,000 MWh.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_onshore_wind_farms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next largest</a> wind farms are significantly smaller than Gansu Wind Farm—Muppandal Wind Farm in India and Alta Wind Energy Centre in the USA have a maximum capacity of 1500 MW and 1320 MW, respectively. With a capacity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Wind_Energy_Center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factor of 30%</a> versus the average factor in India of 15%, the Alta Wind Energy Centre produces an average of 7,342 MWh per day versus 5,400 MWh at Muppandal.</p>
<p>Wind farms can be very small in size and capacity, down to the range of tens of megawatts. With a maximum capacity of only 11 MW, for example, Utgrunden Wind Farm in Sweden is likely to produce on average around 80 MWh per day.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does an offshore wind farm produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>Although offshore wind farms can often achieve a higher capacity factor than onshore equivalents, their total installed capacity is yet to reach the scale of the largest onshore farms. The largest offshore wind farm to date is the UK&#8217;s London Array. With a capacity of 630 MW and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Array#cite_note-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capacity factor in 2015</a> of 45.3%, average daily output approximates to 6,800 MWh.</p>
<p>Similarly to onshore wind, offshore wind farms can be small in size—some below 10 MW of installed capacity. Mt Stuart Wind Farm in New Zealand, for example, produces a daily average of only 70 MWh.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does a solar photovoltaic (PV) farm produce in a day?</strong></p>
<p>As discussed by David MacKay in his book &#8220;Sustainable Energy &#8211; without the hot air&#8221; (<a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/Contents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free here</a>), the electrical energy production per unit area of solar paneling is almost directly proportional to the amount of sunlight that falls upon it. As a result, optimal locations for solar energy, especially at low latitudes can achieve an energy output 2-3 times higher than at very high latitudes. However, as this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photovoltaic_power_stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of the largest solar PV farms</a> shows, solar can deliver a reasonable output across most countries, regardless of latitude.</p>
<p>The largest solar PV farm to date is China&#8217;s Tengger Desert Solar Park, with an installed capacity of 1,500 MW. If we assume a capacity factor of 20% (which is high for solar, but not unreasonable), daily output would be approximately 7,200 MWh. California&#8217;s Topaz Solar Farm has an installed capacity about one-third of China&#8217;s Tengger, but with a high capacity factor of 24.4% achieves an average daily output of 3,466 MWh.</p>
<p>Like onshore and offshore wind, solar PV farms can be as small as tens of megawatt hours per day. Iran&#8217;s largest PV park, Jarqavieh has only 10 MW capacity, and produces an average of 48 MWh (assuming a 20% capacity factor) daily.</p>
<h3>Electricity consumption</h3>
<p>The figures on electricity consumption (represented as horizontal lines on the chart above) are based on figures presented in our below chart on per capita electricity. We have used World Bank estimates of annual per capita electrical power consumption in 2014, by first calculating <em>daily</em> per capita use (by dividing annual figures by 365), and using multipliers of 10 million; one million; and 100,000 to calculate the total daily electricity consumption of a given number of citizens across a range of countries.</p>

<p>Antibiotics are antimicrobial drugs used to kill bacteria. Along with vaccines, antibiotics often top lists of the most <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/TenWays/story?id=3605442&amp;page=1">important medical discoveries</a>, with both interventions having a tremendous impact on illness and deaths from communicable diseases.</p>
<p>However, the usefulness of antibiotics to medicine is under threat. A national campaign in the UK called <a href="http://antibioticguardian.com/keep-antibiotics-working/">‘Keep Antibiotics Working’</a> is trying to prevent antibiotic misuse and overuse by making the point that antibiotics are useless for many illnesses that they are asked for (for example, viral infections such as cold or flu) and contribute to the 5,000 deaths a year in England from untreatable illnesses.</p>
<p>Still it is poorer countries across the world that are likely to take the biggest toll from antibiotic-resistant infections. In 2014 a <a href="https://amr-review.org/">UK study</a> predicted that by 2050 the African region will account for 4.15 million deaths a year attributable to antibiotic-resistant infections and the Asian region 4.73 million. The World Health Organization (WHO) is pursuing a similar campaign this week encouraging all countries to think about antibiotic resistance for <a href="http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/en/">‘World Antibiotic Awareness Week’</a>. The theme this year is: <a href="http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/en/">&#8216;Seek advice from a qualified healthcare professional before taking antibiotics&#8217;</a>.</p>
<h2>Vaccines as a solution for antimicrobial resistance</h2>
<p>Increasing resistance could make common interventions of modern medicine, such as <a href="http://antibioticguardian.com/keep-antibiotics-working/">surgery, chemotherapy, and caesarean sections</a> too dangerous to carry out. As England&#8217;s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/antimicrobial-resistance-poses-catastrophic-threat-says-chief-medical-officer--2">already warned in 2013</a>:<em>“Antimicrobial resistance poses a catastrophic threat. If we don’t act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can’t be treated by antibiotics.”</em></p>
<p>One means of slowing antimicrobial resistance is by combating misuse and overuse as proposed by the campaigns <a href="http://antibioticguardian.com/keep-antibiotics-working/">‘Keep Antibiotics Working’</a> and <a href="http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/en/">&#8216;Seek advice from a qualified healthcare professional before taking antibiotics&#8217;</a>. Other measures include encouraging better hygiene and infection control, surveillance of drug resistance, and reducing the overuse of antibiotics for livestock in agriculture (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotic-resistance-from-livestock">we at OWID looked at this issue in last week&#8217;s post</a>).</p>
<p>Another option is to foster scientific discovery, in order to produce new antibiotics or diagnostics to analyze whether antibiotics are indeed needed. New vaccines are not often connected with solutions for antimicrobial resistance. But vaccine resistance compared with antimicrobial resistance is rare. With a vaccination there is less time for the pathogen to evolve as the body is ready to fight off the infection and also because vaccines target many structures of the pathogen, while antimicrobial drugs target one specific part of the pathogen so that just one mutation can result in resistance. Vaccines therefore present opportunities to reduce our dependence on antibiotics. They can do this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vaccines against bacterial diseases reduce the number of infections and antibiotics used as treatment, including the spectrum of antibiotics used for a condition like pneumonia. This effect can be enhanced by herd immunity where protection is extended to unvaccinated persons in the population. The most used <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf">vaccinations for bacteria</a> are for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, usually combined into one injection (DTP).</li>
<li>Vaccines against viral diseases such as the influenza vaccine reduce the number of infections that are then mistreated with antibiotics. A US study showed that antibiotics were inappropriately prescribed for 79% of influenza patients, with estimated costs of $211 million annually. Furthermore any other complications from a vaccine-preventable disease such as surgery or bacterial infection acquired because of a weakened immune system or hospital stay could also be avoided. A Canadian study estimated a reduction of 60% for antibiotic prescriptions during the influenza season after introduction of a universal seasonal influenza immunization program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Vaccines that are particularly worth scaling up are for pneumococcus and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib), to tackle the approximately 935,000 worldwide of under-5 deaths from pneumonia each year, with these vaccines not yet sufficiently deployed in China, India, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Indonesia. Laxminarayan et al. estimate that for children under 5 years, this amounts to a 47% reduction in days on antibiotics per year with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) that can prevent pneumonia. As the visualization below shows, 11.4 million days of antibiotics could be saved in the 75 countries included in their analysis.</p>

<h2>How new vaccines can help</h2>
<p>No vaccines are currently available for the three bacteria highlighted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an ‘urgent’ hazard of developing resistance (<em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html">Clostridium difficile, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae </a></em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html">or</a><em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html"> CRE </a></em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html">and</a><em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html"> drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae</a></em>). </span>The CDC lists 11 bacteria and one fungus at the &#8216;serious&#8217; hazard level, and three bacteria at the &#8216;concerning&#8217; hazard level.</p>
<p>As our visualization below shows, new vaccines tend to take a long time and vast resources to develop. However, it could be an investment that is worth making, as the problem of antimicrobial resistance does not affect vaccines. Bacterial diseases routinely vaccinated against for decades, for example diphtheria and pertussis, have not shown significant resistance against antibiotics and also resistance for other diseases has been reversed after the vaccine was introduced.</p>
<p>A bacteria that the CDC listed as at a serious hazard level was drug-resistant Salmonella typhi, causing typhoid fever (simply known as typhoid). Typhoid is a bacterial disease that infects over <a href="https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/good-news-in-the-fight-against-typhoid-new-vaccine-study-shows-promising-results">12 million people worldwide each year</a>. The two current vaccines that are available are not suitable for young children nor protective for long periods of time, plus <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32687312">multi-drug-resistant typhoid has been on the rise.</a></p>
<p>A new vaccine for <span class="st">typhoid</span>, tested successfully by the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-09-29-new-typhoid-vaccine-offers-hope-protection-children">Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford</a> could help reduce dependence on antibiotics. The new <span class="st">typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV)</span> vaccine is suitable for children under two and offers longer lasting protection. Gavi, the international organisation that funds vaccines in low and middle-income countries, is now considering backing the vaccine. The chief executive of Gavi, Dr Seth Berkley has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-41724996">stated</a>: <em>“Not only could this vaccine save lives, it could also prove to be a valuable weapon in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.”</em></p>
<p>We need to pursue a wide range of options in order to deal with antimicrobial resistance, including new vaccines. The TCV for typhoid is a step in this direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.<br />
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption/">Meat and Seafood Production &amp; Consumption</a>.</div>
<p><em>Antimicrobial resistance</em> (AMR) — that is, a declining effectiveness of medicines to treat bacterial infections — is identified by the <em>World Health Organization</em> (WHO) as one of the greatest threats to global health, development and food security. AMR occurs when bacterial populations evolve in the presence of an antibiotic medicine; this leads to treatments becoming either less efficient or completely ineffective.</p>
<p>A number of infections, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and salmonellosis are already showing increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment, making them more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Although AMR arises naturally as bacteria encounter antibiotics, the overconsumption of these medicines is accelerating the process. In addition to the overuse of antibiotics in human medicine, their use for livestock farming is also linked to resistance in humans. Antibiotics used in agriculture can be ingested by humans through food consumption. Furthermore, it&#8217;s estimated that up to 90 percent of antibiotics consumed by animals are excreted — releasing them into the natural environment for dispersal in ground and surface waters. In 2016, the UN General Assembly recognised the use of anitbiotics in the livestock sector as one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>This post takes a look at the data on the global use of antibiotics in livestock, and what can be done to limit its impacts on global health and antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<h2>Global use of antibiotics for livestock</h2>
<p>Use of antibiotics for livestock greatly exceeds that of uses for humans: Although data collection on antibiotic use in some regions is poorly documented, its estimated that global veterinary consumption of antibiotics in 2013 was around 131,000 tonnes. In relative terms, antibiotic use in livestock and humans is similar, averaging 118 mg/PCU (population-corrected unit, explained below) and 133 mg/kg, respectively. However, since total livestock biomass greatly exceeds that of human biomass, total antibiotic use for humans is estimated to be much lower — around 40,000 tonnes in 2013. This means antibiotic use in livestock is likely to account for approximately 70-80 percent of total consumption.</p>
<p><strong>But why do we use antibiotics in agriculture?</strong> Like humans, animals are susceptible to bacterial infection — antibiotics are therefore used to treat infected animals. However, their application now extends beyond this. For farmers, often with large populations of animals (which increases the likelihood of bacteria spreading if one animal is infected), it is a priority to make sure that their livestock are in optimum health. The mass use of antibiotics as a preventative measure (rather than as a treatment) has therefore become increasingly common. In addition to their use for infection treatment or prevention, antibiotics are, in some countries (although banned in others, such as the EU) added to animal feed in order to enhance animal productivity and meat yields. This revelation that the supplementation of animal feed with antibiotics led to increased growth was a largely <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/riots-rage-and-resistance-a-brief-history-of-how-antibiotics-arrived-on-the-farm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spontaneous discovery</a> in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Antibiotics use is commonplace across the world. In the chart below we see the consumption of antibiotics in livestock in 2010 (latest available data at national levels) across a range of countries. Since levels of meat production vary significantly across the world, these metrics are reported in milligrams of total antibiotic ingredient used per kilogram of meat production. This is corrected for different livestock species and sizes, giving a population-corrected unit (PCU). This allows us to compare rates of antibiotic use across the world.</p>
<p>As shown, there are large variations between countries, ranging from only 4 milligrams per kilogram in Norway, to greater than 200 milligrams in Cyprus, Spain, Italy and Germany in 2010.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/antibiotic-use-in-livestock" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h2>Regulatory successes: how to reduce antibiotic use</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s expected that as global meat consumption continues to rise, and low-to-middle income nations shift towards more intensive livestock methods, total antibiotic use in livestock will increase from 131,000 tonnes in 2013 to just over 200,000 tonnes in 2030. This increase poses a significant threat to the effectiveness of antibiotic medicines. The UN have issued extensive guidelines on their use in livestock and published a &#8216;strong recommendation&#8217; for overall reduction in the use of medically-important antibiotics in livestock.</p>
<p><strong>How do we reduce our consumption of antibiotics in livestock?</strong> Effective regulation on antibiotic use has proven highly successful in reducing rates of use across several European countries.<br />
Most European countries now collect annual data on antibiotic use and trends for several countries are shown in the chart below.</p>
<p>Rates in Scandanavian countries — Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark — are 50-100 times lower than in other European countries such as Cyprus, Spain and Italy. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Scandanavian nations phased out the use of antibiotics for growth promotion (called &#8216;antibiotic growth promoters; AGPs&#8217;). This led to a significant decline not only in antibiotic use for growth, but also for therapeutic uses. These countries maintain very low levels of antibiotic use partly through a combination of good practices for livestock health (reducing the demand for treatment) and regulatory restrictions.</p>
<p>In 2006, the European Union (EU) <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-05-1687_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned the use</a> of antibiotics for non-medicinal purposes. This has had varying success in reducing consumption across the EU and while in some countries we do not see a decrease there are other EU countries in which we have seen a significant decline after this ban: Germany, France and the United Kingdom have all seen declines in antibiotic use through tightening monitoring and reporting requirements. The UK set a target of reducing consumption below 50mg/kg of meat by 2018; it reached this target two years ahead of schedule. <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/antibiotic-use-in-livestock-in-europe" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>Addressing the threat of AMR will require such reduction efforts to extend globally. Van Boeckel et al. (2017) analysed a range of potential reduction scenarios for the year 2030 (these are further discussed in additional information at the end of this blog). One key mechanism for reduction was setting a global cap of 50 milligrams per kilogram of meat production. In the chart below we have categorised countries based on whether their antibiotic use in 2010 fell above or below this 50mg/PCU suggested cap.</p>
<p>Typically rates of antibiotic use are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/antibiotic-use-in-livestock-vs-gdp-per-capita">larger for higher-income</a> nations, and those with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/antibiotic-use-in-livestock-vs-meat-supply-per-capita">higher levels of meat</a> consumption. However as discussed above, there are some notable exceptions, being lowest in Norway, and also low in Finland, Sweden and Denmark — high-income nations with effective regulation. With good agricultural practices and effective policies, such examples highlight that significantly reduced antibiotic use (and risk of resistance) can be achieved alongside highly productive agricultural sectors. The two are compatible. <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/does-livestock-antibiotic-use-exceed-suggested-target" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>

<div style="font-size: .7em; color: #4a3737;">
<p><em>Additional discussion: </em><br />
<strong>How to reduce antibiotic use</strong><br />
Van Boeckel et al. (2017) projects that under expected rates of antibiotic use and growth in global meat consumption, antibiotic use will increase to just over 200,000 tonnes in 2030 (here, termed &#8216;business-as-usual&#8217;). There are two key mechanisms by which we can reduce total antibiotic consumption: decrease the quantity of antibiotic use per unit (kilogram) of meat production; and/or decrease our overall meat consumption.</p>
<p>Van Boeckel et al. (2017) analysed a range of reduction scenarios to see how effective each would be in reducing total antibiotic use. These reduction scenarios are based on two options for reduction: either setting a limit on rates of antibiotic use to 50 milligrams per kilogram of meat (a target now adopted by several European countries); or reducing overall meat consumption per capita. A highly ambitious meat reduction target to 40 grams per person per day has been proposed (which is in line with China&#8217;s more recent meat guidelines), or alternatively a less stringent reduction to 165 grams per person (the projected EU average level in 2030). Below we look at how either of these options may be achieved. Different approaches to reduction have variable levels of effectiveness. The scenarios in the chart are ordered by increasing effectiveness. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieving a global level of meat consumption of 165 grams per person per day (the projected average level of meat consumption in the EU in 2030) would reduce antibiotic use by <strong>22 percent</strong>;</li>
<li>setting a limit of antibiotic use in OECD countries and China of 50 milligrams per kilogram of meat (50mg/PCU) would reduce consumption by <strong>60 percent. </strong>Van<strong> </strong>Boeckel et al. (2017) suggest this approach to achieve large reductions in antibiotic use without targeting farmers in lower-income countries who rely on livestock rearing for subsistence;</li>
<li>extending this 50 milligrams per kilogram (50mg/PCU) limit to a global level would reduce consumption by <strong>64 percent</strong>;</li>
<li>the most effective approach would be to achieve a global average level of meat consumption of 40 grams per person per day (this is the guideline currently applied in China). This would achieve a <strong>66 percent</strong> reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios look at each mechanism individually, but there is of course options to combine these efforts. For example, if we all limited daily meat consumption to 165 grams per day and OECD countries &amp; China capped antibiotic use at 50mg/PCU we would achieve the same as the most ambitious scenario above: reducing consumption by 66 percent.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reduction-global-antibiotic-use" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How much would we have to reduce meat consumption?</strong><br />
The other option for limiting total antibiotic use is to decrease total meat consumption.  The above scenarios suggested two daily per capita limits: 165 grams (the projected EU average in 2030) or 40 grams (for reference, this is the size of an average burger patty). Levels of meat consumption across the world are shown relative to these levels in the chart below (with red countries consuming more than 165 grams per day, yellow between 40-165 grams, and blue below 40 grams).</p>
<p>Currently, per capita meat consumption across many countries greatly exceeds even the less ambitious 165 gram target. Supply in the United States, for example, was greater than 300 grams per person in 2013. Attaining a global average of 165 grams with more equitable meat consumption across the world will therefore require significant reductions across many countries. Reaching the ambitious target of 40 grams would require a dramatic shift in global consumption habits. The United States would have to reduce meat consumption by 85-90 percent by 2030.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.<br />
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yields and Land Use in Agriculture</a></strong>.</div>
<p>Predictions of a global food crisis — that the world&#8217;s food production would not be able to keep pace with population growth — have a long history. In the 18th century the English cleric Thomas Robert Malthus hypothesized that gains in per capita resources would inevitably be outstripped by population until food supplies finally acted as a barrier to further growth. Such predictions have continued well into the 20th and 21st centuries; in his controversial 1968 book <em>The Population</em> <em>Bomb</em>, Paul Ehrlich argued that global population would continue to grow until the point of mass starvation.</p>
<p>Both Malthus and Ehrlich should be surprised to see the current state of the world. Today, we can support a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/">global population</a> of around 7.4 billion (and growing), with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person/">many consuming</a> far in excess of requirements. There are a number of scientific and technological innovations which have allowed for rapid growth in crop productivity, particularly in the second half of the 20th century. None of these had a more dramatic impact than the ability to produce synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s estimated that nitrogen fertilizer now supports approximately half of the global population. In other words, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch — the pioneers of this technological breakthrough — are estimated to have enabled the lives of several billion people, who otherwise would have died prematurely, or never been born at all. It may be the case that the existence of every second person reading this attributes back to their 20th century innovation.</p>
<h2>Atmospheric alchemy: making fertilizer from air</h2>
<p>Understanding the significance of nitrogen fertilizer requires a brief explanation of its role in global crop production. In addition to water and sunlight, crops need three key nutrients to grow: nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. Nitrogen is often the nutrient that is limiting to further crop production, despite Earth&#8217;s atmosphere containing more than 78 percent. This is because in the atmosphere, nitrogen exists in its largely unreactive N<sub>2 </sub>form, rather than in a reactive form which plants can utilize.</p>
<p>For millennia, agricultural crop had to rely on the limited quantity of reactive nitrogen which was naturally occurring in soils and ecosystems. This remained the case until 1908 when the German chemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Haber">Fritz Haber</a> developed a process by which atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> could be converted into ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) – a form of reactive nitrogen which plants can use.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bosch">Carl Bosch</a>, another German chemist and engineer, was able to take Fritz Haber&#8217;s laboratory-scale process and develop it at an industrial scale. The combined &#8220;Haber-Bosch process&#8221; remains the primary industrial method for the production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
<h2>How many people does nitrogen fertilizer feed?</h2>
<p>In simple terms, crops typically respond positively to nutrient inputs. As we explore in detail in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/">Yields and Land Use in Agriculture,</a> crop yields and fertilizer application typically show a strong <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cereal-crop-yield-vs-fertilizer-application">positive relationship</a>. Fertilizer application, combined with other productivity factors such as improved crop varieties, genetic breeding, irrigation and mechanization led to a significant inflection in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/#yields-in-the-uk-over-the-long-run">crop yield trends</a> across the world in the 20th century. It should be noted that this growth in agricultural output — from both industrial and organic farming — has undoubtedly  resulted in important ecological and resource pressures. However, as we cover in detail in a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/is-organic-agriculture-better-for-the-environment">recent blog</a> post, organic farming (that is, agriculture without synthetic inputs) can often have a greater environmental impact than conventional agriculture.</p>
<p>So, how many people does synthetic nitrogen fertilizer actually feed? Below we draw upon several published estimates, which tend to converge on a similar share of the global population. Results published by Erisman et al. (2012) in the scientific magazine <em>Nature </em>are shown in the chart below. These results also tie closely with Vaclav Smil&#8217;s widely-quoted estimates, which we discuss later.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the chart below we see the actual global population trend in blue — growing from around 1.65 billion in 1900 to almost 7.4 billion in 2015.</li>
<li>The line in grey represents estimates of the number of people fed by synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. As we see, nitrogen fertilizers only became available following the commercialization of the Haber-Bosch process from 1910 onwards. Since then, Erisman et al. estimate it has supported 42 percent of global births over the past century. This amounts to 44 percent of the global population in 2000 being fed by nitrogen fertilizers, rising to 48 percent in 2008. Here we have extended this estimate to 2015 with the continuation of the assumption that 48 percent of the global population are fed by nitrogen fertilizers. Since the share supported by the process continues to rise, this may in fact be a conservative estimate. This means that in 2015, nitrogen fertilizers supported 3.5 billion people that otherwise would have died.</li>
<li>The red line represents the size of the global population which would therefore be supported <em>without</em> the use of nitrogenous fertilizers. This is shown simply as the actual population minus the number of people reliant on them for food production. Without this innovation, global population may have been reduced to only 3.5-4 billion people.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-with-and-without-haber-bosch-nitrogen" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h2>How can we estimate the number of people fed?</h2>
<p>Firstly, it&#8217;s important to note that these estimates are understandably difficult to derive with a high degree of certainty. This difficulty arises for several reasons. Notably there have been a number of additional contributors to productivity gains in agriculture throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, including crop breeding, irrigation, mechanization, and farm management techniques — untangling the individual role of nitrogen fertilizers alone is challenging. Secondly, the global food system is complex and geographically highly unequal: high-income countries have moved beyond the stage of aiming to meet basic nutritional requirements from food production, and now dedicate a large share of food production to meat (which is a much less efficient nitrogen converter) and bioenergy production.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, general estimates tend to converge on a figure in the range of 40-50 percent of the population. Let&#8217;s look at three widely cited estimates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing a range of long-term evaluations, spanning a total of 362 seasons of crop production, of crop yields and nutrient budgets across the world, Stewart et al. (2005) concluded that between 30-50 percent of yield increases could be attributed to synthetic fertilizer inputs (and typically even higher in the tropics). Smil (2004) reached similar conclusions, suggesting with high confidence that global crop harvests would be approximately half of current levels without nitrogen fertilizer inputs.</li>
<li>Vaclav Smil derives his calculations based on the use of nitrogen crop, livestock and human protein (of which the building blocks are nitrogen) balances. His nitrogen balance concluded that 85 percent of all nitrogen in food protein for humans is derived from cropland; the remainder came from seafood or livestock on grazing land. Since nitrogen fertilizer provided around half of the nutrient in this harvested crop, he estimated that it provided 40 percent of dietary protein in the mid-1990s. He concluded that 40 percent of the global population in 2000 were dependent on food production from synthetic fertilizers.</li>
<li>Erisman et al. (2012) have since updated these estimates to the year 2008, estimating a similar (but slightly higher) share of 44 percent in 2000 and 48 percent in 2008.</li>
</ul>
<p>The complexities of the global food system make it challenging to provide a firm figure, however, it&#8217;s likely that just under half of the global population is dependent on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. This is further shown in the chart below. As a result, the Haber-Bosch process is likely to have enabled the lives of at least 3-3.5 billion people today.</p>

<p><em>Additional discussion: </em></p>
<h2>Could we have achieved the same without synthetic nitrogen?</h2>
<p>If Fritz Haber had not discovered how to make synthetic nitrogen, would we have found alternative solutions to support a population as large as today&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Addressing this question partly relies on retrospective guesswork about whether, in the absence of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, we would have managed to supply nitrogen via other methods. If Fritz Haber or Carl Bosch (or any scientist to follow) hadn&#8217;t developed a method for transforming inert atmospheric nitrogen into reactive nitrogen plants could utilize, what is the likelihood that other solutions would have filled the gap?</p>
<p>One solution would have been to greatly increase the production of nitrogen-fixing legume crops. As noted earlier, leguminous crops (i.e. peas, beans and other pulses) possess a unique ability to transform (or &#8216;fix&#8217;) atmospheric nitrogen into reactive nitrogen in the soil. Growing these crops can therefore increase soil nitrogen sources over time. Whilst this might have credibly increased the total availability of reactive nitrogen to some extent, it&#8217;s unlikely to have been a widely-scalable solution for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, legumes tend to be lower-yielding relative to cereals and other staple crops. This is true of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/agricultural-yields-in-key-crops-per-hectare-1961-2014?country=OWID_WRL">yields today</a>, but also true of historical yields — in the late nineteenth century, Western European legume yields were typically less than half that of staple cereals. Farmers in the 19th and early 20th century would have had little incentive to widely adopt these crops. Secondly, despite the many nutritional and environmental benefits of legumes, they form only a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/dietary-compositions-by-commodity-group-1961-2013">small component</a> of most peoples&#8217; diets. Furthermore, preferences for pulses and legumes <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-per-capita-supply-of-pulses">tend to decline</a> as incomes rise and food choices widen. The overall appetite for legumes — both from a farmer&#8217;s and dietary preference perspective means it would have been high unlikely that they would have been able to supply nitrogen at a scale close to that of the Haber-Bosch process throughout the 20th century.</p>
<p>Another potential nitrogen source is that of organic wastes — nitrogen is supplied in many organic farming systems today in the form of animal manure. Couldn&#8217;t we have relied on these non-synthetic nitrogen sources instead? In fact, we did; prior to Haber-Bosch and the creation of synthetic nitrogen inputs, most agricultural systems relied on the recycling of manure, wastes and other biomass back into the soil to maintain nitrogen balance. The issue is that these existed in limited supply: recycling nutrients, by definition, means you have a limited supply. This allowed societies to sustain moderate levels of nitrogen but did not allow them to <em>create more</em>. As Smil (2004) discusses in detail, previous societies could typically support only small numbers of domesticated animals, and as a result, had very limited supplies of manure and animal wastes.</p>
<p>Synthetic nitrogen not only increased crop yields, but also enabled an <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/livestock-counts">expansion in livestock numbers</a>. Increased productivity and excess crops allowed farmers to allocate an increasing share of output to livestock — particularly grain-fed animals. Overall, this has increased the amount of reactive nitrogen which can be recycled through our agricultural systems; with more livestock, we also have more manure to recycle. But it&#8217;s important to recognise that such levels of organic nitrogen sources are only available because of previous synthetic nitrogen inputs. The creation of synthetic nitrogen delivered reactive nitrogen to the soil which could then be recycled in the form of organic wastes and biomass. If organic nitrogen could today support a large share of the global population then it is <em>because</em> synthetic nitrogen has enabled it to do so by adding reactive nitrogen to our agricultural systems. Without Fritz Haber&#8217;s discovery, this would never have been a possibility.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As today’s developed countries grew richer, they experienced a process of ‘structural transformation’. This means they first went through a period of industrialization as the economic center of gravity shifted from agriculture to manufacturing, and then went through a period of deindustrialization, shifting the weight from manufacturing to services. In a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">companion blog post</a> we discuss this pattern in more detail.</p>
<p>How does this compare to the more recent experience of emerging economies? Are today’s developing countries following a similar process of structural transformation?</p>
<p>In this blog post we show that the patterns of structural transformation in developing countries are different to those of advanced, post-industrial economies. Specifically, we show that emerging economies have been deindustrializing more quickly. We explain how and why this is happening, and whether we should be worried about it.</p>
<p>In the first section we explore broad trends of industrialisation, and after pointing out the common patterns, we turn to an analysis of the particular aspects that make structural transformation in today&#8217;s low income countries different, and perhaps problematic. </p>
<h4>Structural transformation, all around the world</h4>
<p><strong>Industry</strong></p>
<p>One way to study the process of ‘structural transformation’ across countries is to track how employment changes across sectors in the economy. The below chart does this, plotting the share of industry in total employment (vertical axis) against GDP per head (horizontal axis). This graph is a &#8216;connected scatter plot&#8217; – each line shows the trajectory that a country followed over time along these two dimensions. Data is available for a selection of more than 40 countries, across all continents.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in this chart. But on the aggregate, it is easy to see a pattern: there is a hump-shaped relationship between industrialization (measured by employment shares) and incomes. In low and high income countries the share working in industrial sectors is low.</p>
<p>As we can see, at low levels of GDP per head, economic growth tends to go together with a rising share of employment in industry; then at an intermediate point in national incomes, the industrial sector reaches a peak; and after that point the relationship is inverted and further economic growth goes together with a lower share of employment in the industrial sector.</p>
<p>If you want to explore trends for a specific country, you can use the &#8216;Search&#8217; option at the bottom of the chart. Or you can click on the continent names, on the right, to highlight regional patterns.</p>
<p>Of course, this broad inverted U-shape pattern is not shared by all countries. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-manufacturing-employment?country=COL">See for example Colombia</a>. And even among countries that do fit the pattern, we can see some interesting variations.</p>
<p>For example, the height of the &#8216;humps&#8217; varies widely across countries. Indeed, the highest peaks in industry employment shares took place in the earliest industrializers: Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden and the UK all reached shares above 40% before beginning to deindustrialize (more on this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">here</a>). Outside Europe, the only countries to have reached comparable levels of industrialization are Mauritius and Taiwan.</p>
<p>You can use the slider at the bottom of this chart to change the time settings. If you move the left point of the slider all the way to 2010, the chart will show a snapshot of the cross-country correlation between average national incomes and the share of employment in industry. Doing this reveals that the cross-country correlation at any point in time is similar to the within-country correlation across time. This means that in the cross-section, the poorest and richest countries have some of the lowest shares of employment in industrial sectors while for individual countries over time, the lowest industry shares correspond to the periods with lowest and highest recorded income levels.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-manufacturing-employment" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>Another way to explore the relative importance of manufacturing and other industrial sectors is to look at their importance in the country&#8217;s total output. This is shown in the next chart, plotting the share of industry in total GDP (vertical axis), against GDP per capita (horizontal axis).</p>
<p>Although the same broad hump-shaped pattern holds, there are two important points here that deserve more discussion.</p>
<p>The first point to note is that in the chart below, countries such as Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria and Venezuela have an extremely large share of industry in GDP vis-a-vis their industry employment shares. This difference can be attributed to the fact that these countries are major natural resource exporters. The mining or oil extraction industries that show up in the data as part of &#8216;industry&#8217; are usually very capital intensive and generate a lot of revenue relative to the quantity of labor employed.</p>
<p>The second point to note is that the observed patterns depend on the actual measure used to capture the relative importance of each sector. Put simply: the hump-shaped pattern is different if we look at employment or GDP shares. Consider South Korea. If we look at employment shares in the chart above, we find that the relative importance of industry in South Korea peaked in 1992. However, if we look at output shares, we find that the relative importance of this sector has not yet peaked. </p>
<p>This point is perhaps not surprising. GDP measures outputs, while employment measures inputs; so it is natural to expect that these two measures of industrialisation provide slightly different perspectives.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-manufacturing-GDP" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>In the chart above we plot current-price measures of value added. This means that the figures correspond to estimates of the value of output calculated at the prices prevailing when the output was produced. Does this matter? It does. Measured this way, the changes in production values between any two years consist of a combination of movements in prices and movements in volumes. Hence, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-industry-GDP-at-constant-prices">the picture would look different</a> if we had chosen to show value added figures in constant prices (i.e. estimating the value of output at the prevailing prices of one fixed point in time). In the technical note at the end of this post we discuss this in more detail. The key point to note is that in constant prices, the pattern of ‘deindustrialization’ in rich countries is less marked. </p>
<p>This reinforces what we already mentioned: alternative ways of measuring the weight of manufacturing and related sectors in the economy offer different perspectives of industrialization patterns. With this in mind, let&#8217;s now turn to exploring industrialization from the perspective of the the other, notably interrelated, sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture and Services</strong></p>
<p>If the weight of the industrial sector in the economy changes, this obviously has a mirror effect on other sectors, namely agriculture and services. The next two charts show the share of employment in agriculture and services against GDP per capita. As we can see, in all the countries with available data, economic growth has meant a shift of workers away from agriculture (first chart below) and into services (second chart below).</p>
<p>Similar patterns can be observed if we plot <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-agriculture-GDP">the share of output from agriculture</a> and the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-services-GDP">share of output from services</a> against GDP per capita.</p>
<p>Taken together, the evidence shows that &#8216;structural transformation&#8217; is a generalized phenomenon. Countries tend to go first through a period of industrialization, where economic activity shifts from agriculture to industry; and then they go through a period of deindustrialization, where there is a shift from industry to services.</p>
<p>This is of course not necessarily a story of a stagnant agricultural sector being overtaken by dynamic manufacturing and service sectors. Instead, this is a story of changes in relative productivity, with one sector overtaking the other. (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">Here</a> you can read more about relative vs absolute changes in productivity in the context of structural transformation).</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-agriculture-employment" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-services-employment" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h4>Structural transformation, different today</h4>
<p><strong>The idea of &#8216;premature deindustrialization&#8217; </strong></p>
<p>Despite the commonly-observed broad patterns discussed so far, it is easy to see that not all countries go through the different stages of structural transformation at the same level of economic development. Compare South Africa and Italy in the chart above. In 2007 South Africa had a GDP per capita similar to that of Italy in 1960. Yet at this level of economic development, South Africa had a much larger share of employment in the service sector (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-services-employment-eg">almost twice as large</a>). </p>
<p>This observation goes further. Many emerging economies, notably those in Africa, have been going through a process of &#8216;premature deindustrialization&#8217;, in the sense that they have experienced a much quicker transition into the services sector relative to the changes experienced by early-industrialized countries when they were at comparable levels of economic development.  </p>
<p>Of course, &#8216;premature deindustrialization&#8217; is not happening everywhere, and to a great extent the broad cross-country pattern we observe is the result of global manufacturing becoming increasingly concentrated in countries such as China. But the fact remains: industry seems to have played a greater role in the growth experiences of today&#8217;s rich countries than in most of today&#8217;s poorer countries.</p>
<p>Let us look at why this is happening, and whether it is a good or bad thing.</p>
<p><strong> What causes premature deindustrialization?</strong></p>
<p>In a much cited paper, Dani Rodrik argues that premature deindustrialization can be attributed to the combination of two factors: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technological-progress/">technological progress</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade">international trade</a>.</p>
<p>Technological progress in recent decades has contributed to reducing the competitiveness of low income countries with a smaller proportion of skilled workers. In the past, many countries entered the manufacturing sector by first engaging in simpler, labor-intensive activities and then gradually moving up the industrial ladder. In recent decades this strategy has become less attainable because of increased skill requirements in the industrial sector. Today, it is no longer the case that farmers can easily transition to working in factories with little investment in additional training.</p>
<p>Globalization, in turn, has interacted with labor-saving technological progress, amplifying the mechanism described above. Comparative advantage forces exacerbate the difficulties faced by low income countries trying to enter a highly competitive global manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/poor-economies-growing-without-industrializing-by-dani-rodrik-2017-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent overview of the literature</a>, Rodrik writes: &#8220;<em>It is now well documented that manufacturing has become increasingly skill-intensive in recent decades. Along with globalization, this has made it very difficult for newcomers to break into world markets for manufacturing in a big way and replicate the experience of Asia’s manufacturing superstars. Except for a handful of exporters, developing economies have been experiencing premature deindustrialization. It seems as if the escalator has been taken away from the lagging countries.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>It is likely that these constraints will remain binding for years to come: unless skills and training expand drastically, automation and further technological change will make it increasingly difficult for today&#8217;s poor countries to follow the path that early-industrialized countries took.</p>
<p><strong>Why should we care?</strong></p>
<p>Failing to develop a sizable secondary sector might have important implications. First, there are redistributive consequences: simple manufacturing industries tend to be quite labor-intensive, so they provide jobs for workers coming from the countryside with relative ease. And second, there might be efficiency consequences: missing out on the ‘manufacturing bandwagon’ lowers growth prospects because manufacturing industries tend to be particularly conducive to productivity growth. This efficiency argument comes from the fact that in the manufacturing sector, more than in other sectors, it is usually easier to absorb technology from abroad and generate high-productivity jobs.</p>
<p>In addition to these factors, there might be other consequences to keep in mind, such as those related to the development of institutions. For example, Rodrik argues that industrialization was crucial for the development of the labor movement, which led to demands for the expansion of voting rights and eventually the creation of the welfare state. Indeed, the political economy literature suggests that bargaining between elites and organized labor played a crucial role in the development of democracy. Hence, since premature deindustrialization can lead to weaker organized labor in today’s low income countries, it may take them down a path of political development that is less conducive to liberal democracy. </p>
<hr style="margin: 10px 0px 20px;" />
<div style="font-size: .7em; color: #4a3737;">
<p><em>Technical note: </em></p>
<p>The charts showing changes in the composition of GDP by sector use current prices (i.e. figures correspond to estimates of value added at the prevailing prices when output took place). Measured this way, the changes in production values between any two years will consist of a combination of movements in prices and movements in volumes. Thus, we cannot know if the change in sectoral composition between any two years is a consequence of price changes or of more ‘fundamental’ structural changes of produced volumes.</p>
<p>An alternative way of measuring sectoral value added is by ‘chaining’ prices to those observed in a particular year, which allows us to control for changes in prices. By dividing sectoral value added by the ratio of current prices to prices in the chained year, it is possible to work out the volume of production.</p>
<p>Although this is a more reliable measure of the growth in productive capacity, it is difficult to use in cross-country comparisons of sectoral composition, due to the tendency of a sector to experience a decline in the price of its output as its productivity rises. Given the tendency for manufacturing to experience higher productivity growth than other sectors of the economy, and consequently for its relative price to fall over time, the implication is that the earlier the year to which we chain prices, the larger the manufacturing sector will appear to be. In fact, Rodrik (2016) finds that in large part, the continued reduction in the current price share of manufacturing in rich countries’ GDP masks the fact that when measured in real terms (ie. keeping prices constant), the trend is less pronounced. The chart in the thumbnail below shows this (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/GDP-vs-industry-GDP-at-constant-prices">here is the interactive version</a>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.<br />
This short post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maternal Mortality</a></strong>.</div>
<p>What could be more tragic than a mother losing her life in the moment that she is giving life to her newborn? The visualization below shows how common this once was. In Finland – the country that today boasts the lowest maternal mortality in the world – we see that during much of the 19th century, maternal mortality hung between 800 and 1,000 deaths for every 100,000 births. In other words, each birth came with up to a 0.9% chance of death. And since women in Finland <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-fertility-rate?tab=chart&amp;country=FIN">gave birth to 5 children</a> on average at the time, this meant that the death of a new mother was no rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The visualization also shows how maternal mortality has changed since then. Starting in the second half of the 19th century, the risk of dying during or after pregnancy has declined from 0.9% to 0.003%. Today, giving birth is 300-times safer than just a few generations ago. How was this possible?</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maternal-mortality?country=FIN+USA+OWID_WRL" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h3>Measurement and progress: The story of Ignaz Semmelweis</h3>
<p>The story of the decline of maternal mortality is a story about scientific research and the importance of measurement. It began with an accidental controlled trial.</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century, the largest maternity hospital in the world was in Vienna, and the most common cause of maternal deaths was puerperal sepsis (an infection of the uterus that killed new mothers shortly after childbirth). There was an unexplained but stark pattern taking place in the Vienna Maternity Hospital. The institution was divided into two wings: doctors and medical students were taught in the first, and midwives were taught in the second. In the first wing, every tenth (!) mother died of puerperal sepsis, while in the second &#8216;only&#8217; one in 25 died. Crucially, women were admitted to the clinics not on the basis of how complicated their case was, but simply on alternate days – in other words, by random allocation. Unintentionally, the hospital had created the conditions suitable for a natural experiment.</p>
<p>In 1846, the young Viennese doctor Ignaz Semmelweis was appointed to the hospital. And it was his suspicion that differences in the routine practices of the two wings would give him insight into what was causing the alarmingly high mortality rates in one. He noticed that in the first wing, where 10% of mothers perished, medical students alternated between helping women to give birth and attending post-mortem examinations of women who had died of puerperal sepsis. They carried out their work in ordinary daytime clothing rather than clean, white coats, and between autopsies and deliveries, they did not wash their hands. By contrast, the pupil midwives in the second clinic did not perform postmortem examinations. And thus, many years before the role of bacteria in diseases was known, Semmelweis discovered that the disease under his study was contagious, and that doctors were transmitting it.</p>
<p>Semmelweis also found that a chemical would destroy the agent that led to the disease, and therefore insisted that his students disinfect their hands with it before attending the labour wards. This led to dramatic results. By 1848, the maternal mortality rates of the two clinics in the Vienna Maternity Hospital were comparable.</p>
<p>However, Semmelweis&#8217;s insistence on his discovery that puerperal sepsis was contagious did not fit into the accepted medical understanding of the time, and this meant an agonizingly slow process of convincing the medical establishment of the importance of better hygiene and measures of antisepsis. Only in the second half of the 19th century was antisepsis widely introduced into routine obstetric practice. But this change, coupled with the discovery of antibiotics and the development of blood transfusion in the first half of the 20th century, sharply drove down the risk of dying in childbirth.</p>
<p>Semmelweis&#8217;s story tells us two things. First, it shows how powerful measurement can be. Decades before the modern germ theory of disease was accepted, and with no understanding of the mechanism that caused puerperal sepsis, it was the measurement of the distribution of maternal deaths that gave Semmelweis the crucial insight about what steps could be taken to effectively reduce maternal mortality. Second, it tells us how frustratingly long it can take until new discoveries become accepted and finally change practices. Semmelweis&#8217;s discovery, which could have led to immediate and widespread improvements, was not widely circulated. More time would have to pass, with more knowledge accumulated, before steep reductions in maternal mortality could take place.</p>
<h3>Maternal mortality today – and where we could be with best practices</h3>
<p>In the chart at the beginning of this article, the short purple line tells us that in 2015 the risk of dying in childbirth stood at 0.216% per birth. Currently, the world sees around 140 million births per year. At the rate of 0.216% this means that globally <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-maternal-deaths?country=OWID_WRL">303,000 mothers will die during child birth this year</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine what it means for loved ones to lose a new mother. Now try to imagine the depth of this devastation 303,000 times over. This is the reality of 2015. The sloping purple line in the chart above tells a story of immense improvement, but it also tells a story that still involves immense tragedy.</p>
<p>The world map below shows the distribution of the risk associated with childbirth today. The global average discussed above hides huge differences in global health. The risk of maternal death is higher than a startling 0.5% in several central African countries.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maternal-mortality?tab=map&amp;year=2015" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>It is still a very long way down for the countries with the poorest health today. But there is something important and positive to be gleaned from the historical perspective seen here. Finland, the country with the lowest maternal mortality rate today, had a higher mortality rate than today&#8217;s worst off countries only a few generations ago. Globally, today&#8217;s maternal mortality rate is similar to that seen in the US in the years after the Second World War. There is no reason to believe that what was possible for Finland and the US should not be possible elsewhere.</p>
<p>We have the advantage of well-established medical and technological knowledge, and this means that today we are capable of reducing maternal mortality at a much faster pace. You can add Tanzania or Cambodia to the first chart above to see how very rapidly some countries have reduced maternal mortality recently.</p>
<p>Given this foundation of knowledge, what can we achieve in the world as a whole? One way to think about this question is to ask how many lives would be saved if the maternal mortality rate of Finland applied to the whole world. The 303,000 annual maternal deaths would be reduced to 4,217. A unique kind of devastation would be avoided nearly 300,000 times.</p>
<p>To a Finnish woman living 150 years ago, today&#8217;s vastly improved reality would have likely been unimaginable. But a reduction to 0.003% is not unimaginable, it is <em>what we know is possible</em>. Our history and experience should encourage us to believe that much better global health is not only possible, it is also achievable if we continue to rely on good measurement and apply the best scientific understanding of what is causing the deaths of mothers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in entries dedicated to specific topics.<br />
This blog post draws on data and research discussed in our entry on <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/">Yields and Land Use in Agriculture</a></strong>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertilizer-and-pesticides/"><b>Fertilizers and Pesticides</b></a>.<br />
This post was first published on October 19th 2017, and was extended on December 19th 2017.</div>
<p>As the total global population <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/#recent-history-and-projections">continues to rise</a> and economic growth drives a transition towards <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption/#meat-consumption-tends-to-rise-as-we-get-richer">more resource-intensive diets</a>, a growing number of consumers are concerned with how to reduce the environmental impact of their dietary choices. Consumers often see organic food as an effective way to reduce their impact: surveys reveal that regardless of geographic location, the primary motivations for organic food purchases are health and environmental concerns. Furthermore, consumers are often willing to pay more for organic products – some studies indicate a willingness-to-pay of up to 100 percent above standard prices. But is this a wise choice? Is going organic really the best way to reduce the environmental impact of our diets?</p>
<p>Before we explore the relative impacts of organic vs. conventional agriculture, it is worth clarifying their definitions. Organic agriculture refers to the farming of crops or livestock without the use of synthetic inputs, including synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, plant growth regulators, nanomaterials and genetically-modified organisms (GMOs). Note that organic does not necessitate &#8216;chemical-free&#8217; or &#8216;pesticide-free&#8217;; chemicals are often used in organic farming, however these cannot be synthetically manufactured, with the exception of a small number which have been approved by the National Organic Standards Board. Conventional (sometimes termed &#8216;industrial&#8217;) farming is therefore any agricultural system which uses one or more of the above synthetic inputs.</p>
<p>The methods applied for weed and pest control in conventional and organic systems can also impact on choices of planting and tillage techniques. Conventional farming often utilises synthetic herbicides for the control of weeds; this approach is typically more conducive to low- or no-till management techniques. Since herbicide applications cannot be widely adopted in organic farming (with some approved exceptions), options for no-till farming <a href="https://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/organic-no-till/">can be more limited</a> and places greater emphasis on approaches such as mechanical controls and/or mulching.</p>
<p>In arable farming (which concerns the production of crops), nutrients can be added to the soil in the form of organic matter, such as green compost, animal manure (human sewage sludge is typically prohibited), or bone meal. For livestock, organic methods mean animals must be fed organically-certified feed (or graze on land with no synthetic chemical inputs), and antibiotics cannot be used throughout their lifetime (except in emergency cases such as disease or infection outbreak). In conventional livestock production, there are no constraints on feed certification and antibiotics or growth hormones are often used. Animal welfare standards for organic certification can vary by country, however for many, livestock must be raised with access to the outdoors (i.e. caged hens are not permitted). Conventional livestock farming covers a range of production methods: they can be produced in either &#8216;free range&#8217; or &#8216;caged&#8217; conditions. These are typically monitored and labelled as such on product packaging.</p>
<p>In this post, we present the empirical evidence comparing organic to conventional agriculture in terms of environmental impact. Despite strong public perception of organic agriculture producing better environmental outcomes, we show that conventional agriculture often performs better on environmental measures including land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution of water bodies. There are, however, some contexts where organic agriculture may be considered appropriate.</p>
<h2>Organic vs. conventional: what are the relative impacts?</h2>
<p>When aiming to provide a comparison of the relative impacts of organic and conventional agriculture, it can often be misleading and misrepresentative to rely on the results of a single comparative study: there will always be single, localised examples where the environmental impacts of a conventional farm are lower than that of a proximate organic farm, and vice versa. In order to provide a global and cross-cutting overview of this comparison, Clark and Tilman (2017) published a meta-analysis of results of published organic-conventional comparisons across 742 agricultural systems over 90 unique foods.</p>
<p>Their analysis reviewed relative impacts across the range of food types – cereals, pulses and oilcrops, fruits, vegetables, dairy and eggs, and meat – and across a range of environmental impact categories – greenhouse gas emissions, land use, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and energy use. &#8216;Eutrophication&#8217; refers to the over-enrichment or pollution of surface waters with nutrients such as nitrogen &amp; phosphorous. Although eutrophication can also occur naturally, the runoff of fertilizer and manure from agricultural land is a dominant source of nutrients. This disaggregation of food types and environmental impacts is important: there is no reason to suggest that the optimal agricultural system for cereal production is the same as for fruits; and there are often trade-offs in terms of environmental impact – one system can prove better in terms of greenhouse gas emissions but higher in land use, for example.</p>
<p>Food systems are made up of many phases – ranging from pre-farm activities, crop production, animal feed production, and harvesting, to transportation, distribution, and cooking. To fully and consistently account for the various stages of production, a process called life-cycle analysis (LCA) is used. LCAs attempt to quantify the combined impacts across several stages of production by considering all inputs and outputs in the complete process. The key in comparing LCAs between products is ensuring that the same number of stages of the supply chain are included in all analyses. For this meta-analysis, Clark &amp; Tilman (2017) compared 164 LCAs which account for inputs pre-farm and on-farm (up until the food leaves the farm).</p>
<p>The aggregated results of Clark &amp; Tilman’s study is shown in the chart below. This comparison measures the relative impact ratio of organic to conventional agriculture, whereby a value of 1.0 means the impact of both systems are the same; values greater than 1.0 mean the impacts of organic systems are higher (worse) (for example, a value of 2.0 would mean organic impacts were twice as high as conventional); and values less than 1.0 mean conventional systems are worse (a value of 0.5 means conventional impacts are twice as high). We see these relative impacts measured by food type across our range of environmental impacts with averages and standard error ranges shown.</p>

<p>We see large differences in impact patterns across environmental categories and food types. For some impacts, one system is consistently better than the alternative; whilst for others, results are mixed depending on crop type and the local agricultural context. The clearest results are for land and energy use. Organic systems consistently perform worse in terms of land use, regardless of food type. As we explore in detail in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/">Yield and Land Use in Agriculture</a>, the world has achieved large gains in productivity and gains in yield over the past half-century in particular, largely as a result of the availability and intensification of inputs such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertilizer-and-pesticides/">fertilizer and pesticides</a>. As a result, the majority of conventional systems achieve a significantly higher yield as compared to organic systems. Therefore, to produce the same quantity of food, organic systems require a larger land area.</p>
<p>This produces the inverse result for energy use. The industrial production of chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides is an energy-intensive process. The absence of synthetic chemical inputs in organic systems therefore means that their energy use is predominantly lower than in intensive conventional agriculture. The exception to this result is vegetables, for which energy use in organic systems tends to be higher. Some of this additional energy use is explained by the use of alternative methods of weed and pest control in organic vegetable farming; a technique widely applied as an alternative to synthetic pesticide application is the use of &#8216;propane-fueled flame weeding&#8217;. The process of propane production and machinery used in its application can add energy costs &#8211; especially for vegetable crops.</p>
<p>Acidification and eutrophication potential are more mixed, but tend to be higher in organic systems; average values across all food types are higher for organic, although there are likely to be some exceptions in particular contexts. Why are organic systems typically worse in these measures? The supply of nutrients in conventional and organic systems are very different; nitrogen supply in conventional agriculture is supplied with the application of synthetic fertilizers, whereas organic farms source their nitrogen from manure application. The timing of nutrient release in these systems is different: fertilizers release nutrients in response to crop demands, meaning nitrogen is released when required by the crops, whereas nitrogen released from manure is more dependent on environmental conditions, such as weather conditions, soil moisture and temperature.</p>
<p>Nutrient-release from manure is therefore not always matched with crop requirements – excess nutrients which are released but not taken up by crops can run off farmland into waterways such as rivers and lakes. As a consequence, the pollution of ecosystems with nutrients from organic farms are often higher than conventional farms, leading to higher eutrophication and acidification potential.</p>
<p>Across all food types, there is no clear winner when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. Results vary strongly depending on food type, although most lie close a ratio of one (where differences in impact between the systems are relatively small). Based on average values, we might conclude that to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we should buy organic pulses and fruits, and conventional cereals, vegetables, and animal products. In general, the greenhouse gas emission sources of organic and conventional systems tend to cancel each other out. Conventional systems produce greenhouse gases through synthetic fertilizer production and application, which is largely balanced by the higher emissions of nitrous oxide (a strong greenhouse gas) from manure application.</p>
<h2>Should we treat environmental impacts equally?</h2>
<p>Organic agriculture proves better for some environmental impacts, and conventional agriculture for others. These trade-offs can make it difficult to decide which we should be choosing. But should we be considering all environmental impacts equally? Should some have higher importance than others?</p>
<p>To evaluate these trade-offs we have to consider a key question: how important is agriculture’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, land use, acidification and eutrophication potential, and energy use? Agriculture’s role in land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy use is summarised in the three charts below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows that agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) is the dominant land user, consuming half of the world&#8217;s habitable land;</li>
<li>The second chart shows that it accounts for approximately one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
<li>The third chart shows that it accounts for only two percent of energy use;</li>
<li>The contribution of AFOLU to acidification and eutrophication is more difficult to quantify, however it is widely considered to be the <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/w2598e/w2598e06.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominant source</a> of nutrient input to aquatic ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>We might therefore conclude that energy use – the only category in which organic agriculture has a clear advantage – is comparatively substantially less important than other impacts.</p>

<h2>Is more intensive agriculture always the answer?</h2>
<p>If we are most concerned with areas of environmental change for which agriculture has the largest impact – namely land use, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions – for which conventional agriculture tends to be advantaged, is the answer to make global farming as intensive as possible? Not necessarily. There are several reasons why this view is too simplistic.</p>
<p>The impacts quantified here fail to capture another important ecological pressure: biodiversity. Conclusive comparisons of the relative impacts of agricultural systems on biodiversity are still lacking. Biodiversity is affected by a number of agricultural impacts, including pesticide application (which can be toxic to some species), soil erosion, and disruption from land tillage methods, and either habitat destruction or fragmentation. Intensive agriculture undoubtedly has severe impacts on local biodiversity. A recent study by Hallmann et al. (2017) reports a greater than 75 percent decline in insect populations over the last 27 years; although unclear as to the primary cause of this decline, it&#8217;s suggested that pesticide use may be a key contributing factor. Organic farming systems also impact biodiversity, but perhaps less dramatically per unit area, due to lower fertilizer and pesticide use. However, as our land-use metrics show: organic agriculture requires far more land than conventional agriculture. This creates a divide in opinion of how best to preserve biodiversity: should we farm intensively over a smaller area (with understanding that biodiversity will be severely affected over this area), or should we farm organically, impacting biodiversity (perhaps less severely) over a much larger area. There is no clear consensus on how best to approach this issue.</p>
<p>Another point to consider is that conventional agriculture is not necessarily better across all food types. Context, both in terms of the food commodity and the local environment, can be important. For example, if greenhouse gas reduction is our main focus, we might be best off eating organic pulses and fruits, and conventional cereals, vegetables, and animal products, based on the results presented above.</p>
<p>This leads us to three key conclusions in the organic-conventional farming debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The common perception that organic food is by default better, or is an ideal way to reduce environmental impact is a clear misconception. Across several metrics, organic agriculture actually proves to be more harmful for the world&#8217;s environment than conventional agriculture.</li>
<li>The debate between organic and intensive agriculture advocates is often needlessly polarized. There are scenarios where one system proves better than the other, and vice versa. If I were to advise on where and when to choose one or the other, I’d advise trying to choose organic pulses and fruits, but sticking with non-organic for all other food products (cereals, vegetables, dairy and eggs, and meat).</li>
<li>The organic-conventional debate often detracts from other aspects of dietary choices which have greater impact. If looking to reduce the environmental impact of your diet, <em>what</em> you eat can be much more influential than <em>how</em> it is produced. The relative difference in land use and greenhouse gas impacts between organic and conventional systems is typically less than a multiple of two. Compare this to the relative differences in impacts between food types where, as shown in the charts below, the difference in land use and greenhouse gas emissions per unit protein between high-impact meats and low-impact crop types can be more than 100-fold. If your primary concern is whether the potato accompanying your steak is conventionally or organically produced, then your focus is arguably misplaced from the decisions which could have the greatest impact.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><em>Sub-note on health and food safety with regards to organic and conventional produce:</em></p>
<p>From a health point-of-view, many consumers consider organic food to be safer due to lower exposure to pesticides. Is organic food healthier and safer in this regard? Clark &amp; Tilman (2017) note that their study did not extend to potential health benefits of organic food. However, they do note that there is evidence that organic foods typically record lower concentrations of pesticide residues. In a study across three investigations in the United States – conducted by the the Pesticide Data Program of the USDA, the Marketplace Surveillance Program of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, and private tests by the Consumers Union – organic foods were found to have around one-third of the pesticide residues of conventionally grown produce.</p>
<p>This is perhaps not a surprising result, considering the use of pesticides is typically higher in conventional agriculture. However, the important question is: should we be concerned about the health impacts of pesticide residues? The World Health Organization (WHO) have established a <a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/87/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR)</a> which establishes &#8216;safe&#8217; intake levels of individual pesticide inputs, where &#8216;acceptable daily intakes&#8217; are set at levels for which exposure would have no carcinogenic effects on human health. Governments and food governance bodies then use acceptable intake levels to establish Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs). These are enforced by national governing bodies to ensure that consumer food has residue levels which are below such MRLs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that residue standards and limits are strongly enforced. A US-based study investigated the ten most frequently identified pesticide residues across twelve commodity groups from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Pesticide Data Program (PDP) database. The authors searched USDA database results for nationwide residue assessments from 2000 to 2008. All pesticide exposure estimates were found to be well below the defined &#8216;chronic reference doses&#8217; (RfDs). Only one product had a residue level greater than 1% of the RfDs (and only just, measured in at 2% of RfDs). The majority (75 percent) of commodities measured below 0.01 percent of RfD limits. For context, this means residue levels were one million times lower than the threshold for which there are observable effects to exposure.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="blog-info">Our World in Data presents the empirical evidence on global development in articles dedicated to specific topics. You can read more about female labor force participation in a <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants">companion blog post</a> which discusses the determinants driving the changes described below.</div>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In almost every country in the world, men are more likely to participate in labor markets than women. However, these gender differences in participation rates have been narrowing substantially in recent decades. In this post we discuss how and why these changes are taking place.</p>
<p>The first section in this article provides an overview of the &#8216;stylized facts&#8217;, including an overview of women&#8217;s participation in the informal economy and unpaid care work. The second section provides an overview of the key factors that have been driving the broad trends (these factors are further discussed in a <a href="http://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants">companion blog post</a>).</p>
<p>Before we move on to the details, here is a preview of the main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>In most countries men tend to participate in labor markets more frequently than women.</li>
<li>All over the world, labor force participation among women of working age increased substantially in the last century.</li>
<li>In some parts of the world, the historical increase in female labor force participation has slowed down or even regressed slightly in recent years.</li>
<li>Women all over the world allocate a substantial amount of time to activities that are not typically recorded as ‘economic activities’. Hence, female participation in labor markets tends to increase when the time-cost of unpaid care work is reduced, shared equally with men, and/or made more compatible with market work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stylized Facts</h3>
<h4>The global picture</h4>
<p>Around the world men tend to participate in labor markets more frequently than women. However, it only takes a glimpse of the data to see that there are huge differences across societies.</p>
<p>The following visualization provides a picture of how men and women compare today in terms of participation in labor markets, country by country. Shown is the female-to-male ratio in labor force participation rates (expressed in percent). These figures show estimates from the International Labor Organization (ILO). These are &#8216;modelled estimates&#8217; in the sense that the ILO produces them after harmonizing various data sources to improve comparability across countries.</p>
<p>As we can see, the numbers for most countries are well below 100%, which means that the participation of women tends to be lower than that of men. Yet differences are outstanding: in countries such as Syria or Algeria, the ratio is below 25%. In contrast, in Laos, Mozambique, Rwanda, Malawi and Togo, the relationship is close to, or even slightly above 100% (i.e. there is gender parity in labor force participation or even a higher share of women participating in the labor market than men).</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation-rates-ILO-WDI" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>Female labor force participation is highest in some of the poorest and richest countries in the world. And it is lowest in countries with average national incomes somewhere in between. In other words: in a cross-section, the relationship between female participation rates and GDP per capita follows a U-shape. This is shown in the scatter plot below.</p>
<p>To highlight continents, you can click on the continent name tags on the right panel. If you do this you will see that some interesting patterns emerge. Within Africa there is a negative correlation (the poorest countries have the highest participation rates), while in Europe there is a positive correlation (the richest European countries have the highest participation rates). Indeed, these correlations within high and low income countries seem to explain a big part of the U-shape that appears in the cross-section.</p>
<p>In the last section of this blog post we provide an overview of the forces that drive this correlation, borrowing from our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">companion blog post</a> on the determinants of female labor force participation.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-by-national-per-capita-income" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>In terms of changes across time, the female labor force participation rate today is higher than three decades ago. This is true in the majority of countries, across all income levels. The chart below shows this, comparing national estimates of female participation rates in 1980 (vertical axis) and 2016 (horizontal axis).</p>
<p>The grey diagonal line in this scatter plot has a slope of one, so countries that have seen positive changes in female labor force participation rates appear below the line. As we can see, most countries lie on the bottom right. Indeed, in some cases, countries are very far below the diagonal line—in Nicaragua, for example, there was a five-fold increase over the period.</p>
<p>On the aggregate, what does this imply for the global trend? The answer is not obvious, since some countries have missing data, and global trends are particularly sensitive to changes in large countries, such as India. In a recent exercise using statistical assumptions to impute missing data, the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/Complete-Report.pdf" target="_blank">World Development Report (2012) </a> estimates that in the period 1980-2008, the global rate of female labor force participation increased from 50.2 to 51.8 percent, while the male rate fell slightly from 82.0 to 77.7 percent. So the gender gap narrowed from 32 percentage points in 1980 to 26 percentage points in 2008.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-2015-vs-1980" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>An important point to note is that the chart above includes all women above 15 years of age. This means that the trends conflate changes across different population sub-groups (e.g. young women, married women, older women above retirement age, etc.). Indeed, group-specific trends do not always follow the overall trends. Specifically, trends in labor force participation among younger women are often different to the aggregate trends, notably in rich countries where participation expanded mostly among the older, often married female population. In many countries the historical increase in female labor force participation took place together with a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/labor-force-participation-rates-for-women-ages-15-24-2016-vs-1980">reduction in participation among younger women</a>, because expansion was driven by women entering labor markets only after attending higher education. We discuss this in more detail below.</p>
<h4>Some historical perspective</h4>
<p>The 20th century saw a radical increase in the number of women participating in labor markets across early-industrialized countries. The following visualization shows this. It plots long-run female participation rates, piecing together OECD data and available historical estimates for a selection of early-industrialized countries.</p>
<p>As we can see, there are positive trends across all of these countries. Notably, growth in participation began at different points in time, and proceeded at different rates; nonetheless, the substantial and sustained increases in the labor force participation of women in rich countries remains a striking feature of economic and social change in the 20th century.</p>
<p>However, this chart also shows that in many rich countries – such as, for example, the US – growth in participation slowed down considerably or even stopped at the turn of the 21st century.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-OECD" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>What do we know about the characteristics of the women who drove this remarkable historical expansion of female labor force participation in rich countries? As it turns out, the evidence shows that most of the long-run increase in the participation of women in labor markets throughout the last century is attributable specifically to an increase in the participation of married women.</p>
<p>As an example, the following visualization shows female labor force participation rates in the US, differentiated by marital status. As we can see, the marked upward trend observed for the general female population is mainly driven by the trend among married women. Heckman and Killingsworth (1986) provide evidence of similar historical trends for the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LFP-UK-Married-Women-Heckman-and-Killingsworth-1986-.png">UK</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LFP-Germany-Married-Women-Heckman-and-Killingsworth-1986-.png">Germany</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LFP-Canada-Married-Women-Heckman-and-Killingsworth-1986-.png">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>The charts above provide evidence regarding the expansion of female labor supply via higher participation rates. But this is of course only one way of measuring market supply. What about the number of hours worked? This is a relevant question since working hours for the general population <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/productivity-vs-annual-hours-worked?stackMode=absolute&amp;time=1950..2014">decreased substantially in rich countries as they increased their productivity throughout the 20th century</a>.</p>
<p>The following chart provides some clues. It shows several decades of changing average weekly hours worked for women in a selection of OECD countries. As we can see, most countries show negative trends, which is consistent with the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/work-hours-per-week?country=AUS+BEL+CAN+DNK+FRA+DEU+IRL+ITA+NLD+ESP+SWE+CHE+GBR+USA">trends for the population as a whole</a>. However, some of these trends are still remarkable if we take into account the substantial increase in female participation taking place at the same time.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Spain: in the period 1987-2016, weekly work in a main job decreased from about 39 hours, to about 35 hours; while participation rates for women increased from 32% to 54% in the same period.</p>
<p>This is an important pattern: at the same time as more women in rich countries started participating in labor markets, there was often a reduction in the average number of hours that women spent at work. In economics lingo: the 20th century witnessed a large increase in supply of female labor along the extensive margin (number of workers), together with some reductions along the intensive margin (hours worked per worker).</p>
<p>Available evidence shows that the effect along the extensive margin was much stronger. So in these countries there was an increase in the sum of female worker hours – that is, the total yearly hours worked per female worker increased across all female workers.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-usual-weekly-hours-worked-women-15" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h4>Recent developments</h4>
<p>In the beginning of the post we point out that since 1980, female participation in labor markets has increased in most countries; yet according to the <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/Complete-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 World Development Report</a> the global trend only increased slightly over the same period – from 50.2% to 51.8%.</p>
<p>If we focus on more recent developments, the ILO estimates show that the global trend is actually negative, mainly because of important reductions in some world regions. This is shown in the visualization below.</p>
<p>As we can see, regional trends in recent years go in different directions. Notably, there have been large reductions in South and East Asia, and large increases in Latin America. In the Middle East and North Africa there have also been positive trends, but this remains the region where female participation rates are lowest.</p>

<h4>Working women vs. Women in the labor force</h4>
<p><strong>A taxonomy of labor supply</strong></p>
<p>Before we move on to explore the determinants of female participation in labor markets, it is important that we dig deeper into the concepts. We have already said that labor force participation is defined as being ‘economically active’. But what does that <em>actually</em> mean? Being able to answer this question is crucial to understanding changes in female participation in labor markets, since women typically invest time on productive activities that do not count as ‘market labor supply’.</p>
<p>From a conceptual point of view, people who are economically active are those who are either employed (including part-time employment starting from one hour a week) or unemployed (including anyone looking for job, even if it is for the first time). Students who do not have a job and are not looking for one, are not economically active.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines stipulated by the ILO</a>, &#8217;employment&#8217; also includes self-employment, which means that in principle, the labor force includes anyone who supplies labor for the production of economic goods and services, independently of whether they do so for pay, profit or family gain. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-13-at-11.21.39.png">This chart from the ILO</a> shows an overview of what counts and what doesn’t towards producing &#8216;economic goods and services&#8217;.</p>
<p>Loosely speaking, the guidelines stipulate that unpaid activities should be excluded if they lead to services or goods produced and consumed within the household (and they are not the prime contribution to the total consumption of the household). This often means excluding unpaid work on things like &#8220;Preparation and serving of meals&#8221;; &#8220;Care, training and instruction of children&#8221;; or &#8220;Cleaning, decorating and maintenance of the dwelling&#8221;. The implication, then, is that even if the guidelines are followed closely to include all possible forms of economic activities, even in the informal sector, there will still be an important number of &#8216;working women&#8217; who are excluded from the labor force statistics. And these exclusions are even more salient if we consider that in many countries actual measurement deviates from the guidelines.</p>
<p>In many countries with poor capacity to produce national statistics, labor force participation is measured from population censuses, rather than from labor force surveys especially designed for that purpose. The consequence of this is that labor force statistics often exclude individuals who should be covered by the definitions above. Among the most important exclusions are workers engaged in unpaid work.</p>
<p>Given all of this, it is natural to wonder if the &#8216;key facts&#8217; would look different if we used an alternative definition of labor supply. Let&#8217;s try to break down the figures to understand any relevant differences between &#8216;labor supply&#8217; and other notions of &#8216;work&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking down the numbers</strong></p>
<p>The first and most obvious line splitting the economically active population in a country is employment. The chart below plots female employment-to-population ratios across the world (national estimates before ILO corrections). These figures show the number of employed women as a share of the total female population (in both cases, for women ages 15 or older).</p>
<p>To emphasize, here we are leaving aside unemployment, and we are focusing on trends for employed women – who are, by definition a subset of the whole economically active population.</p>
<p>As we can see, the trends are consistent with those for labor force participation: In the period 1980-2016, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-to-population-ratio-2015-vs-1980">the majority of countries saw an increase in the share of women who are employed</a>. This is what we would expect – it means that, by and large, the participation of women in the labor market was driven by employment, rather than unemployment.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/modeled-female-employment-to-population-ratio?tab=chart">This chart</a> shows the same variable but using ILO modeled estimates. These provide a shorter time perspective, but are more accurate and complete.)</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-to-population-ratio" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>Let us turn now to informal employment. As we mentioned above, the ILO guidelines stipulate that labor participation should include informal employment. So this is another important line that, in principle, cuts across the economically active population.</p>
<p>The first point to note is that, despite the guidelines, in practical terms work in the informal sector is not always reflected in labor statistics due to measurement issues. So an empirical study of economically active women in the informal sector remains a challenge. Nevertheless, some progress has been made on this front, and today many countries do report disaggregated figures for some forms of informal employment, mainly those relating to paid work in non-agricultural economic activities. (You can read more about measurement and definitions of informal employment in the ILO report <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_234413.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Women and Men in the Informal Economy: A Statistical Picture&#8221;</a>.) The chart below shows these estimates.</p>
<p>The bars corresponds to the share of women employed in the informal economy, as a share of all women who are employed in non-agricultural economic activities. Years differ from country to country, and there is unfortunately still insufficient data to explore time trends. However, as we can see, the data does show that a large part of female employment around the world takes place in the informal economy. In fact, in many low and middle income countries, the vast majority of women engaged in paid work are in the informal economy. For women in Uganda, for example, almost 95% of paid work outside agriculture is informal. In Greece, the corresponding figure is close to 4%.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/male-vs-female-informal-employment-as-share-of-total-employment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this interactive data visualization</a> you can see how the figures below compare to those for men. The data suggests that in the majority of countries, women tend to work in the informal economy more often than men. And it is likely that this gender difference would be larger if we accounted for the informal agricultural economy, for which data is not available. This is important because national sources of protection and support – as well as legal and policy frameworks – tend to favor formal workers.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/women-in-informal-employment-as-share-of-female-employment" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>Let us now have a look at unpaid work. As we have noted, domestic unpaid care work is an important activity which women tend to spend a significant amount of time on – and it is an activity that is typically unaccounted for in labor supply statistics. In the following chart we show just how skewed the gender distribution of unpaid care work in the household is.</p>
<p>The bars show the female-to-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid services provided within the household, including care of persons, housework and voluntary community work. You can add countries using the button labeled &#8216;Add Country&#8217;. And you can click on the &#8216;Map&#8217; tab to get a cross-country overview.</p>
<p>As we can see, gender differences in time devoted to unpaid care work cut across societies: All over the world, women spend more time than men on these activities. Yet there are clear differences when it comes to the magnitude of these gender gaps. At the low end of the spectrum, in Uganda women work 18% more than men in unpaid care activities at home. While at the opposite end of the spectrum, in countries such as India, women work 10 times more than men on these activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-09-19-at-10.07.12.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This chart</a> provides a sense of perspective on the levels. In the MENA region, where the gap tends to be largest, women spend on average over 5 hours on unpaid care work per day, while men spend less than one hour.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-to-male-ratio-of-time-devoted-to-unpaid-care-work" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h3>The forces driving change</h3>
<p>To recap: women all over the world allocate a substantial amount of their time to activities that are not typically recorded as ‘economic activities’. What does this tell us about time allocation and labor supply more generally? The answer is perhaps unsurprising. Female participation in labor markets tends to increase when the time-cost of unpaid care work is reduced, shared equally with men, and/or made more compatible with market work.</p>
<p>You can find more details about the determinants of female labor supply in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/">companion blog post</a>. Here we provide a quick overview of the key &#8216;drivers&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Maternal health </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The various aspects related to maternity impose a substantial burden on women’s time. And this is of course a biological burden uniquely borne by women. Moreover, maternity is not only a burden in terms of time. It is also risky, and often imposes on women a substantial <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">burden in terms of health</a>. Improved maternal health alleviates the adverse effects of pregnancy and childbirth on women&#8217;s ability to work, and is hence a key driver of female labor force participation.</li>
<li>Estimates suggest that the historical decline in the burden of maternal conditions and the introduction of infant formula can account for approximately 50 percent of the increase in married women’s labor force participation between 1930 and 1960 in the US.</li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/index-of-us-maternal-mortality-and-female-labor-force-participation-flfp">Here</a> is a chart that shows long-run trends in maternal mortality and female labor supply in the US. You can read more about maternal mortality <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">here</a>, and you can read more about its link to female labor supply <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#maternal-health">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fertility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower rates of fertility can, in principle, free up a significant amount of women’s time, hence allowing them to enter the labor force more easily. And this is of course independent of health complications – having children is very time consuming even when enjoying perfect health.</li>
<li>Indeed, there is strong evidence of a causal link between fertility (having children) and labor market outcomes (participation, employment, wages, etc.). In a recent study Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017) show that women who are successfully treated by IVF (in vitro fertilization) in Denmark earn persistently less because of having children. They explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older.</li>
<li>There are many other studies that find similar effects on female labor supply when there are exogenous shocks to fertility. And interestingly, there is evidence that women’s control over their own fertility is linked to career investments and subsequent changes in labor market outcomes (see, for example, Goldin and Katz 2002).</li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fertility-and-female-labor-force-participation">Here</a> is a chart that shows the correlation between fertility and labor supply. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#fertility">Here</a> you can read more about the evidence supporting a causal link. And <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/">here</a> you can read more about fertility in general.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Childcare and other family-oriented policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that fertility reductions lead to higher labor force participation for women is certainly important from an empirical point of view. But it is obviously contradictory to promote female agency while suggesting women should have fewer children. So it is helpful to consider other factors that make employment compatible with childbearing, and thus broaden the choices available to women. Childcare and other family-oriented policies are prime examples here.</li>
<li>A cross-sectional analysis of data on public spending on family benefits shows that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-vs-public-spending-on-family-benefits-oecd">female employment tends to be higher in countries with higher levels of public spending on family benefits</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#childcare-and-other-family-oriented-policies">Here</a> you can read more about the evidence behind family-oriented policies and female labor supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Labor-saving consumer durables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The consumer goods revolution, which introduced labor-saving durables such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and other time-saving products, is another factor that contributed to the rise in married female labor force participation in the last century.</li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours/#as-productivity-in-the-household-increased-working-hours-in-the-household-declined">Here</a> is a brief discussion of the correlation between hours worked in domestic activities and the availability of basic electrical appliances. And <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#labor-saving-consumer-durables">here</a> you can find more details about an academic study that estimates the associated effect on female labor supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social norms and culture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social norms and culture circumscribe the extent to which it is possible or desirable for women to enter the labor force. It is therefore not hard to see why they play an important role.</li>
<li>Socially assigned gender roles have often been institutionally enforced. And this is still the case today: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/are-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-allowed-to-do-the-same-jobs-as-men">In most countries around the world there are restrictions on the types of work that women can do</a>.</li>
<li>From a historical point of view, there is evidence that social norms regarding economic gender roles have long been around, and they are very persistent (see, for example, Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn 2013).</li>
<li>And yet, despite social norms being persistent, there is also evidence that large and sometimes sudden changes are possible. Research in this area shows that social norms and culture can be influenced in a number of non-institutional ways, including through intergenerational learning processes, exposure to alternative norms, and activism such as that which propelled the women&#8217;s movement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structural changes in the economy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Social barriers affecting female labor supply operate differently in different contexts. In particular, income levels and macroeconomic variables play an important role. As we show above, there is a U-shaped relationship between GDP per capita and female labor force participation.
<ul>
<li>In low-income countries, where the agricultural sector is particularly important for the national economy, women are heavily involved in production, primarily as family workers. Under such circumstances, productive and reproductive work are not strictly delineated and the two can be more easily reconciled.</li>
<li>With technological change and market expansion, however, work becomes more capital intensive and is often physically separated from the home, thus contributing to a decrease in women’s labor force participation. Hence, in middle income countries, where there is often a social stigma attached to married women working in blue-collar industries, &#8220;women’s work is often implicitly bought by the family, and women retreat into the home, although their hours of work may not materially change.&#8221;</li>
<li>With sustained development, women make educational gains and the value of their time in the market increases alongside the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">demand-side pull from growing service industries</a>. This means that in high income countries, the rise in female labor supply is characterized by women gaining the option of moving into paid, often white-collar work, while the opportunity cost of exiting the workforce for childcare rises.</li>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In almost every country in the world, men are more likely to participate in labor markets than women. However, these gender differences have been narrowing substantially, and in most countries around the world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-OECD">the share of women who are part of the labor force is higher today than half a century ago</a>. In this blog post we discuss the key factors driving this change (for an in-depth look at the change itself, including key facts and trends, see our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/female-labor-force-participation-key-facts">companion blog post</a>).</p>
<p>In order to understand changing female labor force participation, it is important to first conceptualize the overarching context within which various factors operate. For women to be able to participate in the labor market, they have to have the <em>time</em> and <em>opportunity</em> to do so. This means that we can only fully analyze labor force participation if we understand time allocation more generally. In the case of female labor supply in particular, time allocation is crucially affected by the fact that women all over the world tend to spend a substantial amount of time on activities such as unpaid care work, which <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/female-labor-force-participation-key-facts#working-women-vs-women-in-the-labor-force">fall outside of the traditional economic production boundary</a>. In other words, women often work but are not regarded as &#8216;economically active&#8217; for the purpose of labor supply statistics.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates this. Across all world regions, women spend more time on unpaid care work than men. On average, women spend between three and six hours on unpaid care work per day, while men spend between half an hour and two hours. If we consider the sum of paid and unpaid work, women tend to work <em>more</em> than men – on average, 2.6 extra hours per week across the OECD. For an interactive chart that shows the female-to-male ratio of time devoted to unpaid care work by country, see <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-to-male-ratio-of-time-devoted-to-unpaid-care-work">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is therefore not surprising that the factors driving change in female labor supply – whether they are improvements in maternal health, reductions in the number of children, childcare provision, or gains in household technology – all affect unpaid care work. Because time allocation is gendered in this way, female participation in labor markets tends to increase when the time-cost of unpaid care work is reduced, shared equally with men, and/or made more compatible with market work. Crucially, this analysis is not intended to diminish the importance of unpaid care work. On the contrary, such work is fundamental to – rather than separate from – economic activity and wellbeing, and the fact that it is omitted from national accounts is a point of debate.</p>
<p>With this said, an obvious question remains: why do women perform a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work in the first place? As we discuss <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/#social-and-cultural-factors">below</a>, although time-use should be a choice, evidence shows that social norms play a large part in determining gender roles and consequently, gendered time-use.</p>

<p>Keeping this context in mind, let&#8217;s have a look at the evidence behind the &#8216;drivers&#8217; of rising female labor force participation.</p>
<h4>Maternal health</h4>
<p>The various aspects related to maternity – pregnancy, childbirth, and the period shortly after childbirth – impose a substantial burden on women&#8217;s health and time. This, in turn, can have a significant impact on women&#8217;s ability to participate in the labor force.</p>
<p>Before 1930, maternal mortality was the second biggest cause of death for American women in their childbearing years, claiming 850 deaths for every 100,000 live births in 1900. And for each such death, 20 times as many mothers experienced pregnancy-related health conditions which often included long-lasting or chronic disability. While maternal mortality has dropped to 10 deaths per 100,000 births across most rich countries, it is still comparatively high in poorer countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, had a rate of 547 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015. (For more information on maternal health, see our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality/">Maternal Mortality</a>.)</p>
<p>In a recent study, researchers Albanesi and Olivetti (2016) consider how improvements in maternal health between 1930 and 1960 contributed to rising female labor force participation in the US during that time period. Their approach is based on a calibrated macroeconomic model of household behavior. In other words, the authors incorporate numerical measures of medical progress into a quantitative model to assess the role of improving maternal health in accounting for the rise in labor force participation of married women in the US.</p>
<p>To measure &#8216;medical progress&#8217;, Albanesi and Olivetti draw on historical data and use it to estimate the burden of maternal conditions using the concept of &#8216;disability-adjusted life years&#8217;, or DALYs (you can find more details about this concept in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease/">Burden of Disease</a>). Their estimates suggest that the time lost to disabilities associated with maternal conditions declined from 2.31 years per pregnancy in 1920 to 0.17 in 1960. According to their model, the historical decline in the burden of maternal conditions and the introduction of infant formula can account for approximately 50 percent of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Labor-Force-Participation-of-women-in-the-US-1955-2005.png">increase in married women’s labor force participation</a> between 1930 and 1960 in the US.</p>
<p>The below chart plots US maternal mortality and female labor force participation as an index to their respective values in 1900 (thus 1900 = 100). As we can see, the correlation is stark: maternal mortality declines steeply between 1930 and 1960, during which period female labor force participation rises rapidly. (To see this relationship in a connected scatterplot displaying the raw data for both variables, see <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maternal-mortality-vs-female-labor-force-participation">here</a>.)</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/index-of-us-maternal-mortality-and-female-labor-force-participation-flfp" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h4>The number of children per woman</h4>
<p>On average, mothers around the world continue to spend more time on childcare than fathers. Because of this, fewer children per woman – lower fertility rates – can theoretically free up women&#8217;s time and contribute to an increase in female labor force participation.</p>
<p>The following visualization shows fertility and female labor force participation across the world. For each country, the arrows compare observations for 1960 and 2015. Despite some outliers and some clear differences by region, we can see that most arrows point north-west – that is, in most countries female labor force participation has gone up at the same time that fertility has gone down.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fertility-and-female-labor-force-participation" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>However, correlation is not the same as causation: a woman&#8217;s choice to have fewer children might be influenced by the rising female labor force participation itself or other factors driving it. Instead, causal evidence can be found in studies that have identified exogenous – in other words, externally caused – changes in family size and measured their impact on labor market outcomes.</p>
<p>Some such studies provide evidence from twins, as conceiving twins can be seen as an unexpected increase in fertility. Other studies have considered women who sought medical help in achieving pregnancy. In those cases, fertility treatments create a &#8216;control group&#8217; of women who were unable to become pregnant and a &#8216;treatment group&#8217; of those who were able to get pregnant. And yet other studies have used country-level policies, such as abortion legislation, as an exogenous source of variation in fertility. When available, abortion can be seen as a way to avoid unwanted childbirth, and researchers argue that the timing of policy shifts making abortion legal and available is exogenous.</p>
<p>In all of these studies, researchers find strong evidence of a causal link between higher fertility rates and lower labor market participation. In the most recent of the studies, Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017) find that women who are successfully treated by in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Denmark earn persistently less because of having children. This decline in annual earnings is explained by the fact that women tend to work less when their children are young and in turn get paid less when their children are older.</p>
<p>But of course, while &#8216;exogenous variation&#8217; in the number of children per woman is an important way to establish causality, what actually matters is how women&#8217;s control over their reproductive choices affects labor market outcomes. In their widely cited 2002 paper, &#8220;The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women&#8217;s Career and Marriage Decisions&#8221;, Goldin and Katz (2002) examine the behavioral effect of increasing women&#8217;s control over their fertility. Their research shows how the diffusion of the birth control pill in the US during the late 1960s contributed to changing women&#8217;s career and marriage choices by eliminating the risk of pregnancy, encouraging career investment, and &#8220;enabling young men and women to put off marriage while not having to put off sex.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Childcare and other family-oriented policies</h4>
<p>The fact that falling fertility rates lead to higher labor force participation for women is certainly important from an empirical point of view. But it is obviously contradictory to promote female agency while suggesting women should have fewer children.</p>
<p>So it is helpful to consider other factors that make employment compatible with childbearing and thus broaden the choices available to women. Let&#8217;s begin with childcare, parental leave, and other family-oriented policies.</p>
<p>While the years after World War II saw a rise in women’s labor force participation across every OECD country, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-OECD">growth in participation began at different points in time, and proceeded at different rates in each country</a>. In 2016, for example, Sweden’s female labor force participation rate was 70%, while it was only 56% in Germany and 40% in Italy. Researchers comparing broad policy configurations argue that the different types of welfare states that emerged in rich countries after World War II have contributed to these differences.</p>
<p>Social democratic policies such as those seen in Sweden, for example, are characterized by subsidized childcare, paid parental leave that is designed to encourage both mothers <em>and</em> fathers to participate in childcare, and support for full employment. Liberal welfare states, on the other hand, take a more hands-off approach to social policy – one prominent example is the US’s maternity leave, which guarantees only 12 weeks of <em>unpaid</em> annual leave.</p>
<p>In the chart below, we show that female employment, measured as the employment-to-population ratios for women 15+, tends to be higher in countries with higher levels of public spending on family benefits (i.e. child-related cash transfers to families with children, public spending on services for families with children, and financial support for families provided through the tax system, including tax exemptions).</p>
<p>And while the pattern seen in this chart is only a correlation, evidence suggests that this relationship is in fact causal. A natural experiment from Canada, for example, provides compelling proof that childcare support can have a positive effect on the labor force participation rate of mothers with young children. In 1997, the provincial government of Quebec introduced a generous subsidy for childcare services, effectively imposing an exogenous reduction in childcare prices. Researchers Lefebvre and Merrigan (2008) found that this policy had substantial labor supply effects on the mothers of preschool children, both among well-educated and less well-educated mothers. In 2002, the policy increased the participation rate of mothers (with at least one child aged 1-5 years) by 8 percentage points, and their hours worked increased by 231 per year.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-employment-vs-public-spending-on-family-benefits-oecd" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h4>Labor-saving consumer durables</h4>
<p>In 1890, only 24% of US households had running water. In 1900, 98% of households in the US washed their clothes using a scrubboard and water heated on a wood or coal-burning stove. It is not hard to see then why in 1900, the average American household spent 58 hours per week on housework. By 1975, that figure had declined to 18. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption/#technology-adoption-in-us-households">Progress in labor-saving consumer durables in the household</a> has thus been another factor contributing to the rise in female labor force participation, especially in early-industrialized countries. Of course, this is feasible especially because women – both in 1900 and now – take on a disproportionate amount of unpaid domestic work.</p>
<p>Greenwood et al. (2005) present evidence for this by calibrating a quantitative economic model to show that the consumer goods revolution – which, as we can see in the chart below introduced washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and other time-saving products – can help explain the rise in married female labor force participation in the US.</p>
<p>It is important to know, however, that these improvements have not yet reached all households around the world. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-people-in-the-world-with-and-without-access-to-improved-water-sources">9% of the global population</a> (about 663 million people) are still without access to improved water sources. A recent study by Graham, Hirai, and Kim (2016) looked at water-collection in Sub-Saharan Africa – where it is estimated that more than two-thirds of the population must leave their home to collect water – and found that this time-consuming and physically grueling chore falls primarily to women.</p>

<h4>Social and cultural factors</h4>
<p>Some argue that there is a &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution of gender roles, with women being better suited to domestic and child-rearing responsibility and men to working outside of the home. Such assertions lack compelling evidence and more importantly, perpetuate a status quo that limits the choices available to both men and women. Instead, it is known that social norms and culture influence the way we see the world and our role in it. To this end, there is little doubt that the gender roles assigned to men and women are in no small part socially constructed.</p>
<p>To determine when and how existing gender norms first gained a foothold, researchers have attempted to connect historical evidence to modern norms and opinions. For example, Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2013) contribute to the explanation of existing cross-cultural beliefs and values about the appropriate role of women in society by looking at the division of labor in the distant past. They test the hypothesis that historically, societies that adopted plough-based agriculture, which required &#8220;significant upper body strength&#8221;, gave men an advantage relative to women in a crucial aspect of production. They contrast such societies to those that employed &#8216;shifting cultivation&#8217;, which uses hand-held tools like the hoe, and which women participated actively in. Their findings suggest that the division of labor that arose around plough-use generated persistent cultural norms about the appropriate role of women in society, which norms have continued to exist at an individual level beyond agrarian economies and under different institutional structures. By comparing pre-industrial ethnographic data with contemporary measures of individuals’ views on gender roles across countries, ethnic groups, and individuals, they show that historical plough use has a positive statistical relationship with unequal gender roles today. They construct a map, shown below, which approximates the global distribution of languages and historical plough use for each group. This data is used to show a correlation between historical plough use and lower female participation in the labor force today.</p>
<p>Another study published in the journal <em>Science</em> by Dyble et al. (2015), goes even further back in time, arguing that hypercooperation among hunter-gatherers – an important characteristic that may serve to evolutionarily differentiate modern humans from our ancestors – was enabled by sex egalitarianism. The study uses agent-based modeling to suggest that wealth and sex inequalities began to emerge when &#8220;heritable resources, such as land and livestock, became important determinants of reproductive success.&#8221;</p>
<h6>Global distribution of languages and historical plough use – Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2013)</h6>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM.png"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM.png" alt="" width="1279" height="579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13901" srcset="http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM.png 1279w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM-150x68.png 150w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM-400x181.png 400w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM-768x348.png 768w, http://l:8080/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-10-07-at-4.34.18-PM-750x340.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" /></a></p>
<p>And while it is possible that socially-assigned gender roles emerged in the distant past, our recent and even current practices show that these roles persist with the help of institutional enforcement. Goldin (1988), for instance, examines past prohibitions against the training and employment of married women in the US. She touches on some well-known restrictions, such as those against the training and employment of women as doctors and lawyers, before focusing on the lesser known but even more impactful &#8220;marriage bars&#8221; which arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s. These work prohibitions are important because they applied to teaching and clerical jobs – occupations that would become the most commonly held among married women after 1950. Around the time the US entered World War II, it is estimated that 87% of all school boards would not hire a married woman and 70% would not retain an unmarried woman who married.</p>
<p>The below map shows that to this day, barriers to female labor force participation are prevalent across the world. The data in this map, which comes from the World Bank&#8217;s World Development Indicators, provides a measure of whether there are any specific jobs that non-pregnant and non-nursing women are not allowed to perform. So, for example, a country might be coded as &#8220;No&#8221; if women are only allowed to work in certain jobs within the mining industry, such as health care professionals within mines, but not as miners.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/can-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-do-the-same-jobs-as-men" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<p>But even after explicit barriers are lifted and legal protections put in their place, discrimination and bias can persist in less overt ways. Goldin and Rouse (1997), for example, look at the adoption of &#8220;blind&#8221; auditions by orchestras, and show that by using a screen to conceal the identity of a candidate, impartial hiring practices increased the number of women in orchestras by 25% between 1970 and 1996.</p>
<p>In fact, discrimination and biases operate in many other ways, permeating all spheres of life. As the chart below shows, at the end of World War II, only 18% of people in the US thought that a wife should work if her husband was able to support her. Indeed, it is not surprising that around this time, female labor supply in market activities was low, and demand-side barriers were high. As this chart shows, female labor supply started increasing in the US alongside changing social norms: people&#8217;s approval of married women working went up during a period of remarkable growth in female labor force participation, and then <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-OECD?country=USA">flattened at around the same time that participation stalled</a>. For more details on this see Fortin (2015) and Goldin and Katz (2016).</p>
<p>Social norms and culture are clearly important determinants of female labor force participation. So how can social norms be changed? Research in this area shows that social norms and culture can be influenced in a number of non-institutional ways, including through intergenerational learning processes, exposure to alternative norms, and activism such as that which propelled the women&#8217;s movement.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/approve-of-wife-working-if-husband-can-support" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h4>Structural changes in the economy</h4>
<p>Having now discussed the various determinants affecting women&#8217;s labor force participation in the context of socially-assigned gender roles, we turn to the larger picture. How do these pieces factor into a global landscape of varied income levels and changing economic conditions?</p>
<p>In low-income countries, where the agricultural sector is particularly important for the national economy, we see that women are heavily involved in production, primarily as family workers. Under such circumstances, productive and reproductive work is not strictly delineated and can be more easily reconciled. With technological change and market expansion, however, work becomes more capital intensive and is often physically separated from the home. In middle income countries, there is an observed social stigma attached to married women working and &#8220;women’s work is often implicitly bought by the family, and women retreat into the home, although their hours of work may not materially change.&#8221;</p>
<p>With sustained development, women make educational gains and the value of their time in the market increases alongside the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries/">demand-side pull from growing service industries</a>. This means that in high income countries, the rise in female labor force participation is characterized by women gaining the option of moving into paid, often white-collar work, while the opportunity cost of exiting the workforce for childcare rises.</p>
<p>The chart below shows some evidence of this pattern. As we can see, female labor force participation is highest in some of the poorest and richest countries in the world, while it is lowest in countries with incomes somewhere in between. In other words: in a cross-section, the relationship between female participation rates and GDP per capita follows a U-shape.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/female-labor-force-participation-key-facts#working-women-vs-women-in-the-labor-force">informal employment in the agricultural sector is typically not captured in labor statistics</a>, the chart below offers only partial evidence of the mechanisms described above. However, multiple studies have found support of a U-shaped female labor supply function, both within and across countries over the course of development.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-labor-force-participation-by-national-per-capita-income" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>
<h4>Closing remarks</h4>
<p>The rise in female labor force participation has been one of the most notable economic developments of the past century. In many countries, this change has been driven by the large and sustained increase in <em>married</em> women&#8217;s labor force participation. There is good reason for this. In the context of &#8216;private&#8217; family life, social norms across the world have long dictated that women should perform unpaid care work – taking care of children and elderly parents, making meals, doing laundry, maintaining family relations – while men engage in market work. Therefore, the factors that have given married women the option to enter the labor force are foreseeably those that have lowered the time-cost of unpaid care work or made employment more compatible with it. Of course, this is not to say that unpaid care work is unimportant: it is a crucial, albeit unrecorded, aspect of economic development and wellbeing. Rather, the hope is that with sustained social change, neither women nor men will be obliged to make decisions about time allocation on the basis of their sex.</p>
