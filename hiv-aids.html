<section><h2>Empirical View</h2><p>The 1990s saw a substantial increase in the number of people infected with HIV and dying of AIDS. In 1997, almost 3.5 million people were diagnosed with HIV per year. After 1997, the number of new diagnoses began to decline and in 2015 it was reduced to 2.1 million per year.</p><p>The number of AIDS-related deaths increased throughout the 1990s and reached a peak in 2004, 2005 when in both years 2 million people died. Since then the annual number of deaths from AIDS declined as well and a decade later it was almost halved when 1.1 million people died in 2015.</p><p>The chart also shows the continuing increase in the number of people living with HIV. The rate of increase has slowed down compared to the 1990s but the absolute number reached a peak in 2015 when 36.7 million people were living with HIV globally.</p><h6>Global number of AIDS-related deaths, new HIV Infections, and People living with HIV (1990-2015)<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a><p></p>

<p>The following chart shows that while globally life expectancy has been increasing since the 1960s, several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa saw a major decrease in life expectancy with the onset of the AIDS crisis around 1990. Life expectancy has started to increase again since the early 2000s, but for the countries shown, it still has not reached a level as high&#xA0;as it was before the AIDS crisis.</p>
