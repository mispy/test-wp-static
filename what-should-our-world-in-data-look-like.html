Some&#xA0;entries are getting very long (e.g. <a href="/financing-healthcare/">financing of healthcare</a>&#xA0;or <a href="/global-rise-of-education">global education</a>) and&#xA0;we think it should be possible to find a format that works better for the reader.</p><p>Usually, we discuss&#xA0;things like this internally but in this case, I thought I would share our challenge here. We don&apos;t have a designer on our team and I&apos;m hoping that there is a small chance that someone who reads this might understand how to find a good format and can give us some hints.</p><p><strong>Design</strong></p><p>What do the designers&#xA0;out there think about the look of Our World In Data? What needs to be changed? Fonts? Logos? Colors?</p><p><strong>Structure</strong></p><p>Each of our entries is dedicated to a specific aspect of global living conditions &#x2013; poverty, child mortality, etc. They have a standardized format and are structured into&#xA0;<a href="/about/#the-data-entries">4 sections</a>.&#xA0;What we are looking for&#xA0;is a format that works for all entries and makes sense for our content and 4-section structure.</p><p>The new structure&#xA0;should make it easier for the reader to read&#xA0;the text and the visuals. Especially for those readers who are not reading the entire entry (the majority of readers), it should be as easy as possible to find the&#xA0;bit of the entry that they are interested in.</p><p>Our current idea is that the &quot;Empirical View&quot; (section 1) section stays as it is. The&#xA0;following &quot;Correlates, determinants and consequences&quot; section we&#xA0;want to change in our current draft. The section&#xA0;should&#xA0;not&#xA0;be shown by default&#xA0;and instead we want to use a mix of (1) <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp">accordions</a> that open sections within the document and (2) links to shorter pages that open in a new tab and that have the format of our <a href="/blog/">blog posts</a>.</p><p>The first reason for&#xA0;the new structure of the correlates section is to make the entries shorter. The second reason is that linking to outside documents makes sense for our website since&#xA0;a text on the link between AIDS and poverty for example can then be linked to from both the entry on AIDS and the entry on poverty.</p><p>I have made an Adobe Illustrator file of an entire entry for our internal discussion, but if you are interested in giving us feedback you can download it here:</p><p>&#x2013; <a href="/roser/Redesign%20%e2%80%93%20OWID%20%28Poverty%29.ai">the Illustrator file with&#xA0;my current thoughts on how to do the redesign</a>.</p><p>&#x2013; for reference:&#xA0;<a href="/roser/Current%20design%20%e2%80%93%20OWID%20entry%20on%20Global%20Extreme%20Poverty.ai">the Illustrator file&#xA0;of an entire entry&#xA0;as an entry&#xA0;currently looks on our website</a>.</p><p>The example that I used is the revision draft of our entry on <a href="/extreme-poverty/">extreme poverty</a>. A text with visuals that we worked on for the last months and that we will publish soon.</p><p>If you have an idea of how we should redesign our entries please let me know via&#xA0;<a href="mailto:max@ourworldindata.org">max@ourworldindata.org</a>.<br>
Many thanks! Max</p></section>
