Life expectancy&#xA0;differed massively between ages&#xA0;in 1845 &#x2013; from 40 years for newborns to 79 for 70-year olds. Today the difference in life expectancies between these age groups&#xA0;is much smaller; Newborns can expect to live until age 81 to, and 70-year olds to age 86. This is because the chance of dying at a younger age has been steadily decreasing, which means that the&#xA0;equality of life expectancy across ages has increased.</p><h6>Total life expectancy in the UK by age, 1541-2001 &#x2013; Max Roser<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a><br>

</h6><h3>Inequality by socio-economic class</h3><p>In absolute terms the inequality of life expectancy has decreased massively in the UK &#x2013; the visualisation above showed that the Gini for life expectancy has declined from over .45 to below .1 in the beginning of the 21st century.</p><p>We can see below that the gap in infant mortality has narrowed significantly in absolute terms; there were 80 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for infants with fathers who were in unskilled manual fields, versus 32 deaths per 1,000 live births born to fathers with professional careers, representing a&#xA0;2.5 times lower rate. Today, those absolute mortality numbers are only 7.4 and 3.8 respectively, but there is still nearly a two-fold difference in mortality rate. Absolute inequality&#xA0;has&#xA0;decreased dramatically, but the ratio between the two &#x2013; a measure of&#xA0;relative inequality &#x2013; has only decreased a little.</p><p>When considering how the inequality of child mortality has decreased, one has to take into account that the occupational structure has also changed &#x2013; the share of people employed in the low-skilled sector has decreased. The authors of the data below &#x2013; Floud, Fogel, Harris, Hong &#x2013; add that the &quot;differences are still apparent even after allowances have been made for the effects of changes in the occupational structure of the British population and selection effect&quot;.<a id="ref-4" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-4"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">4</sup></a></p><h6>Infant mortality rates of both sexes by father&#x2019;s social class in England and Wales, 1930/2-2001<a id="ref-5" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-5"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">5</sup></a><br>

</h6><h3>Disease Inequality</h3><p>Not only is&#xA0;lower socioeconomic status (SES) associated with shorter life span, but it is also correlated with higher disease prevalence. Cox et al (2006) found multiple studies using various measures of&#xA0;SES that predominantly&#xA0;pointed to higher rates of incidence and mortality of stroke in lower SES categories.<a id="ref-6" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-6"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">6</sup></a> Kanervisto et al (2011) found that basic educational level was a risk factor for chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD), and low household income was a risk factor for asthma.<a id="ref-7" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-7"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">7</sup></a> Karp et al (2004) found that low education level is a risk factor for Alzheimer&apos;s Disease, and that this risk is not mediated by adult socioeconomic mobility.<a id="ref-8" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-8"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">8</sup></a> Kington and Smith found that even after controlling for differences in education, income and wealth, African Americans report higher rates of hypertension, diabetes and arthritis than Whites, and Hispanics report higher rates of hypertension and diabetes and lower rates of heart conditions.<a id="ref-9" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-9"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">9</sup></a></p></section>












<section><h2>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2><p>As intuition would suggest, the healthcare system&#xA0;of a society affects the health of that society. There is much debate about what the best system is. One study from Gruber et al (2014) analyzes a 2001 healthcare reform in Thailand called &quot;30 Baht&quot;. The program increased funding to hospitals to care for the poor and decreased copays to 30 Baht, which is approximately $0.75 USD. The study suggests that the program increased healthcare utilization especially among the poorest, and infant mortality was significantly reduced. After the implementation of 30 Baht, the correlation between the wealth of the Thai province and infant mortality reduced to nearly 0.&#xA0;<a id="ref-10" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-10"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">10</sup></a></p></section>

The visualization shows the total life expectancy since birth and not the remaining life expectancy.

&nbsp;

The data for life expectancy by age is taken from the Human Mortality Database.  University of California, Berkeley (USA), and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany). Available at <a href="http://www.mortality.org">www.mortality.org</a> (data downloaded on 11 February 2014).

The data on life expectancy at birth before 1845 is taken the data from Kertzer and Laslett (1995) - see below. Their sources are the 'British official statistics' and Wrigley and Schofield [1981] 1989.
Kertzer and Laslett (eds) (1995) - Aging in the Past: Demography, Society, and Old Age. Berkeley:  University of California Press. Online <a href="http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft096n99tf/ ">here</a>.

(The Human Mortality Database data refers to remaining life expectancy for people in a 5 year age bracket (10-14, 15-19, ...). To calculate total life expectancy I have added the lower bound of each range to the remaining life expectancy for the given age group – the values here should therefore be understood as the lower bound for total life expectancy.)</p></div></li><li id="note-4" style="margin-top: 0px;" class="side-matter side-matter-note"><div class="side-matter side-matter-text"><p>For the source see the next citation.</p></div></li><li id="note-5" style="margin-top: 0px;" class="side-matter side-matter-note"><div class="side-matter side-matter-text"><p></h6>
