--></p><h3>The Decline of Working Hours per Year after the Industrial Revolution</h3><p>The researchers Michael Huberman and Chris Minns published estimates of weekly work hours going back to the late 19th century. This data &#x2013; shown in the following visualization &#x2013; shows that over this time working hours have steeply declined. Full-time workers in these countries work 20 or even 30 hours less every week than in the 19th century.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/work-hours-per-week" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/work-hours-per-week_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/work-hours-per-week"></div></a></div></p><h3>Working Hours in Hunter-Gatherer and Other Premodern Societies</h3><p>Anthropologic studies of hunter-gatherer and subsistence cultivation societies show that labor inputs are small.

<section><h2>Correlates, Determinants and Consequences</h2><h3>As productivity increases working hours decrease</h3><p>Productivity increases also entailed decreasing work hours per week. This relationship &#x2013; in the cross section &#x2013; is shown in the following data visualization.<br>

The authors find that &quot;there were significant declines in time spent in home production by women in every age group&quot;. You can see the data for women broken down by age group <a href="/grapher/weekly-hours-dedicated-to-home-production-in-the-usa-by-women">here</a>.</p><p>Gender roles are changing and men work increasingly more hours in the household. For men the authors find that time spent in home production increased for every age group. Men between 25 and 54 increased their home production time from 3.7 hours per week in 1900 to 17 hours per week in 2005. The data broken down by age group is presented <a href="/grapher/weekly-hours-by-men-dedicated-to-home-production-in-the-usa">here</a>.<br>

In 1975 it was down to 18. For 2015 I have relied on data from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/">American Time Use survey</a> to calculate that the weekly work hours spent on these three chores for a household of one man and one woman is 7:42 hours<a id="ref-4" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-4"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">4</sup></a></p><p>This chart shows how over the course of the 20th century more and more household appliances became available in more and more households.This chart is available in an interactive version <a href="http://" grapher="" share-of-us-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances"="">here</a>.</p><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-750x525.png" alt="" width="750" height="525" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11612" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Share-of-US-households-with-basic-electrical-appliances-with-working-hours-2-768x538.png 768w"></a></p></section>

Data for 2015 are from the American Time Use Survey <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/household.htm">here</a>, which is conducted by the BLS. It is unclear what the definition of a household in Greenwood is. For 2015 I have assumed that the definition of a household is one man and one woman, this is also done by Roberts and Rupert (1995), which are cited by Greenwood et al.

The breakdown of the American Time Use survey is as follows:

meal preparation
 – women: 37 min 
 – men: 17 min

laundry
 – women: 17 min
 – men: 5 min

For cleaning I have included the categories ‘interior cleaning’ and ‘kitchen and food clean-up in the survey
 – women: 29 min + 13 min = 42 min
 – men: 10 min + 4 min = 14 min

The sum for men is 17+5+14 = 36 min of chores on average per day.
The sum for women is 37+17+42 = 96 min of chores on average per day.
For a household of one man and one woman these are 132 minutes
Multiplied by 7 days. These are 924 minutes (or 15 hours and 24 minutes).

An earlier version of this chart mistakenly showed the weekly working hours per person for 2015. Many thanks to Gray Kimbrough for pointing this mistake out!</p></div></li></ol></section></footer></article></main><div id="wpadminbar" style="display: none;"><div id="wp-toolbar" role="navigation" aria-label="Toolbar" class="quicklinks"><ul id="wp-admin-bar-root-default" class="ab-top-menu"><li id="wp-admin-bar-site-name" class="menupop"><a aria-haspopup="true" href="/wp-admin/" class="ab-item">Our World In Data</a></li><li id="wp-admin-bar-edit"><a href="http://l:8080/wp-admin/post.php?post=418&amp;action=edit" class="ab-item">Edit Page</a></li></ul></div></div><footer class="SiteFooter"><div><a href="/" class="logo">Our World in Data</a> is a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/au/">creative commons</a> publication about human civilization at a global scale.</div><nav><a href="/about">About</a><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe</a><a href="https://twitter.com/OurWorldInData">Twitter</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/OurWorldinData">Facebook</a><a href="https://github.com/owid">GitHub</a><a href="/support">Donate</a></nav><script src="http://localhost:8095/js/owid.js"></script></footer></body></html>
