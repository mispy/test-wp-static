&#x2013;&#x2013;&#x2013;</p><p>Having access to reliable cross-country data on taxation is important because it helps us understand and contextualize the changing landscape of public policy around the world. And yet, while the importance of high-quality data on taxation that is comparable across time and countries is widely recognised, there are substantial deficiencies in the estimates published by traditional sources.  In this blog post I want to highlight the efforts of the <a href="https://www.ictd.ac">International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD)</a> to produce a new dataset that tries to address some of these deficiencies, and that has perhaps not received all the attention it deserves.</p><p>Today, the most widely used source of cross-country data on taxation is arguably the IMF Government Finance Statistics (IMF-GFS). Unfortunately, despite IMF efforts, the estimates published in this source are problematic for a number of reasons.</p><p>Perhaps the most important limitation of IMF-GFS estimates is coverage: there is extensive missing data, with large spatial and temporal gaps. Yet coverage is not the only limitation. The IMF-GFS estimates are inconsistent with estimates published in other mainstream sources such as the World Bank World Development Indicators (WB-WDI), both because of differences in the methodology used to construct the variables, and because of inconsistencies in the way countries collect and report underlying revenue data.</p><p>The following chart, from Prichard (2016), shows an example of data discrepancies in tax revenues for Ghana.<a id="ref-1" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-1"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">1</sup></a> The different series correspond to different sources: the blue line denotes estimates using IMF Article IV reports, the orange line denotes estimates from the IMF-GFS, the yellow line denotes data from IMF Country Reports, and the green line denotes estimates from the World Bank World Development Indicators.<a id="ref-2" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-2"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">2</sup></a></p><p>As can be seen, research findings and policy conclusions would be quite different depending on the source that one uses to characterize the evolution of tax revenues in Ghana.</p><h6>Alternative measures of Tax revenue (% GDP), Ghana, 1980-2010 &#x2013; Prichard (2016)<a id="ref-3" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-3"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">3</sup></a></h6><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GhanaData_Prichard2016.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8872" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GhanaData_Prichard2016-750x400.png" alt="ghanadata_prichard2016" width="750" height="400"></a></p><p>Considering the above, the <a href="https://www.ictd.ac">International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD)</a> recently started producing a depurated dataset that combines data from multiple sources (including the OECD, the IMF-GFS and the WB-WDI among others), applying consistency checks and flagging potential problems that may arise with the interpretation of estimates. This is a very valuable resource for research and a clear improvement over the individual underlying sources.</p><p>The following visualization maps cross-country estimates of total tax revenues as a share of GDP from the new ICTD Government Revenue Dataset (ICTD-GRD). You can find many other visualizations using this data in our entry on <a href="/taxation/">taxation</a>.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/total-tax-revenues-gdp?tab=map" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/total-tax-revenues-gdp-a42c8357c168ebd03c90930b9d3c439b_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/total-tax-revenues-gdp?tab=map"></div></a></div></p><p>One of the key advantages of the ICTD-GRD is that it stipulates a clear hierarchy for underlying sources, country by country. Generally speaking, the ICTD-GRD prioritises sources with (i) longer time series, and (ii) higher levels of disaggregation of sub-categories of revenues, such as social contributions. Yet each case is analysed independently, so the underlying sources are hand-picked, country by country, year by year. This yields fewer missing observations and more consistent estimates across countries and time.</p><p>Another important advantage of the ICTD-GRD is that it flags estimates that seem problematic. These flags include remarks such as &apos;Data not credible, &apos;Data is of Questionable Analytical Comparability&apos;, and &apos;Cannot Exclude Resource Revenue from Sub-Components of Total Tax Revenue&apos;. This is evidently convenient for anyone interested in doing econometric analysis: researchers can report results both with and without the flagged data.</p><p>Of course, there remains much to be done regarding cross-country data quality in the field of taxation. While the transparent process of manual data cleaning in the ICTD-GRD is clearly a step forward, it is by no means a definitive solution. Misreporting by countries makes it difficult to unambiguously rank sources.</p><p>You can read more about how the ICTD-GRD was constructed in Prichard et al.
