</h6><h4>Employment in agriculture since 1800</h4><p>The visualisation below shows the total number of people employed in agriculture across select European, North American and Asian countries since the year 1800. Over this period - and in particular since 1950 - we see an overall decline in agricultural employment to comparably low levels of employment today.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/number-of-people-employed-in-agriculture-since-1800" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/number-of-people-employed-in-agriculture-since-1800_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/number-of-people-employed-in-agriculture-since-1800"></div></a></div></p><h3>Share employed in agriculture</h3><p>The map shows the share employed in agriculture country by country. Three quarters of the labor force in a poor country like Madagascar are employed in agriculture. In rich countries like Germany or the UK it is only 1 in 100 who is employed in agriculture.<br>

</h6><h3>Women in agriculture</h3><h4>Land ownership by women</h4><p>The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) aim to capture data on the role of women in agriculture and land ownership within its <a href="https://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gender and Land Rights Database</a>. In the map below we see the share of agricultural landowners who are female as a percentage of total agricultural landowners. As part of its definition the FAO notes that this measure is inclusive of women who own the land solely or jointly with someone else inside or outside of the household.<a id="ref-4" class="side-matter side-matter-ref" href="#note-4"><sup class="side-matter side-matter-sup">4</sup></a></p><p>Unfortunately such data is not gathered continuously or periodically across most countries, so we are limited to results from a single census year. Note that this census year is not consistent across all countries. Data for most European and North American countries is based on 2010-11 datasets, whereas other countries can extend from 1993-2011. For graphing consistency, this has been shown as a single year (e.g. assuming these figures are representative of 2011). The actual years of measurement for each country can be found in the referenced FAO report and database.</p><p>For the majority of countries, female land ownership represents less than 30 percent of total ownership. However, this has significant variation across the world, without a strict continental pattern. Overall, we see the highest rates of female ownership in Europe, however Botswana and Malawi both have ownership shares greater than 30 percent. Although some of the lowest rates are recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, high-income countries can also have a low incidence of female land ownership; the United States, United Kingdom, Norway and Finland all have shares below 15 percent.</p><p><div class="interactivePreview"><a href="/grapher/share-of-agricultural-landowners-who-are-female" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-of-agricultural-landowners-who-are-female_v1_850x600.svg" data-grapher-src="/grapher/share-of-agricultural-landowners-who-are-female"></div></a></div></p><h3>Agricultural productivity</h3><p>In the chart below, we have mapped the agriculture value added per worker (measured in 2010 constant US$). Agriculture value added per worker is calculated as the total agricultural value added divided by the number of people employed in agriculture.</p><p>Overall, we see the highest rates of agricultural value added per worker in across Europe, North America and New Zealand; in 2015, several countries had a value added per worker of $70,000. In comparison, most countries across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where the value added per worker was typically less than $1,000 in 2015.<br>

This is from chapter 12 (authored by Richard J. Sullivan) in Simon(Editor) (1996) - <em>The State of Humanity</em>. Wiley-Blackwell.
In this publication it is Figure 12.1.
Agriculture includes forestry and fishing. Data for the period from 1840 to the present are from Mitchell (1981) and the Yearbook of Labour Statistics for The Netherlands and France, and from Lee (1979) for England.

Mitchell, Brian R. (1981): European Historical Statistics, 2nd edn. New York: Facts on File, 159-73.
For the period 1500-1800, the data are from Wrigley (1986), with the following adjustments. Agriculture's share of the total labor force are Wrigley's share of the agricultural population. The absolute size of the agricultural labor force was calculated as 45% of Wrigley's agricultural population. The 45% is a rough estimate based on the agricultural labor force participation rate for early nineteenth century England.
